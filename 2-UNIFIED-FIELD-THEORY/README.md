# Unified Field Theory

A unified field theory MUST HAVE A UNIFYING CONSTANT based on certain properties of the unified field, whatever it may be, since it conducts electromagnetic and gravitron forces.

# Basics

As I understand, unified field theory ties together everything we already know in physics:
- the 4 fundamental forces (graivity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear)
- time (relativity) and space

It has to explain:
- The Graviflyer
- superconducting
- particle wave duality
- quantization

More generally, it should explain all "anomalies" and relations between these forces, and easily explain the dominant forces acting on objects in various situations:
- classical Newtonian mechanics
- nuclear-force at microscopic scale
- gravity at very large scales

## Whistleblower Description (see rexresearch)

The physics theories in academia are "grossly in error".

Relativity theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics are terribly outdated.

The new theory does not begin with physical observables. Rather, it postulates the existence of an underlying reality consisting of an inherently unobservable subtle substance called an ether, which fills all space. It then defines all of its fundamental quantities at that subphysical level.

Physical observables then emerge as mathematical solutions to equations defined in terms of these more basic ether processes.

This new physics regards time and space as ABSOLUTES and views Einstein's notion of relative time and space as fundamentally INCORRECT.

Physically observable phenomena such as length contraction and clock retardation, normally interpreted as alterations of the space-time continuum, emerge as manifestations resulting from MOTION through the absolute ether.

This ether physics embraces:
- TT Brown's electrogravitics phenomenon along with additional classified research (Philadelphia experiment?)
- Phenomena discovered by Tesla (Coulomb waves?)
