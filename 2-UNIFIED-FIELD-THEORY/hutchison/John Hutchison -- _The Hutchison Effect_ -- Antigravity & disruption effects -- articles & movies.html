      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>People often ask, "What exactly is the Hutchison Effect?" </p>
      <p>This brief essay is an attempt to answer that question to the
        satisfaction of the majority. </p>
      <p>First of all, the Hutchison Effect is a collection of phenomena
        which were discovered accidentally by John Hutchison during
        attempts to study the longitudinal waves of Tesla back in 1979.
        In other words, the Hutchison Effect is not simply a singular
        effect.&nbsp; It is many. </p>
      <p>The Hutchison Effect occurs as the result of radio wave
        interferences in a zone of spatial volume encompassed by high
        voltage sources, usually a Van de Graff generator, and two or
        more Tesla coils. </p>
      <p>The effects produced include levitation of heavy objects,
        fusion of dissimilar materials such as metal and wood (exactly
        as portrayed in the movie, "The Philadelphia Experiment"), the
        anomalous heating of metals without burning adjacent material,
        spontaneous fracturing of metals (which separate by sliding in a
        sideways fashion), and both temporary and permanent changes <br>
        in the crystalline structure and physical properties of metals.
      </p>
      <p>The levitation of heavy objects by the Hutchison Effect is
        not---repeat not---the result of simple electrostatic or
        electromagnetic levitation. Claims that these forces alone can
        explain the phenomenon are patently ridiculous, and easily
        disproved by merely trying to use such methods to duplicate what
        the Hutchison Effect has achieved, which has been well
        documented both on film and videotape, and has been witnessed
        many times by numerous credentialed scientists and engineers.
        Challengers should note that their apparatus must be limited to
        the use of 75 Watts of power from a 120 Volt AC outlet, as that
        is all that is used by Hutchison's apparatus to levitate a
        60-pound cannon ball. </p>
      <p>The fusion of dissimilar materials, which is exceedingly
        remarkable, indicates clearly that the Hutchison Effect has a
        powerful influence on Van der Waals forces. In a striking and
        baffling contradiction, dissimilar substances can simply "come
        together," yet the individual substances do not dissociate. A
        block of wood can simply "sink into" a metal bar, yet neither
        the metal bar nor the block of wood come apart.&nbsp; Also,
        there is no evidence of displacement, such as would occur if,
        for example, one were to sink a stone into a bowl of water. </p>
      <p>The anomalous heating of metal without any evidence of burning
        or scorching of the adjacent materials (usually wood) is a clear
        indication that possibly the nature of heat may not be
        completely understood. This has far-reaching implications for
        thermodynamics, which hinges entirely on the presumption of such
        knowledge. It should be noted that the entirety of
        thermodynamics is represented by the infrared portion of the
        electromagnetic spectrum, which is insignificant in a context of
        0 Hz to infinite Hz. The anomalous heating exhibited by the
        Hutchison Effect shows plainly that we have much to learn,
        especially where thermodynamics and electromagnetism meet. </p>
      <p>The spontaneous fracturing of metals, as occurs with the
        Hutchison Effect, is unique for two reasons: (1) there is no
        evidence of an "external force" causing the fracturing, and (2)
        the method by which the metal separates involves a sliding
        motion in a sideways direction, horizontally. The metal simply
        comes apart. </p>
      <p>Some temporary changes in the crystalline structure and
        physical properties of metals are somewhat reminiscent of the
        "spoon bending" of Uri Geller, except that there is no one near
        the metal samples when the changes take place. One video shows a
        spoon flapping up and down like a limp rag in a stiff breeze. In
        the case of permanent changes, a metal bar will be hard at one
        end, like steel, and soft at the other end, like powdered lead.
        Again, this is evidence of strong influence on Van der Waals
        forces. </p>
      <p>The radio wave interferences involved in producing these
        effects are produced from as many as four and five different
        radio sources, all operating at low power.&nbsp; However, the
        zone in which the interferences take place is stressed by
        hundreds of kilovolts. </p>
      <p>It is surmised by some researchers that what Hutchison has done
        is tap into the Zero Point Energy. This energy gets its name
        from the fact that it is evidenced by oscillations at zero
        degrees Kelvin, where supposedly all activity in an atom
        ceases.&nbsp; The energy is associated with the spontaneous
        emission and annihilation of electrons and positrons coming from
        what is called "the quantum vacuum." The density of the energy
        contained in the quantum vacuum is estimated by some at ten to
        the thirteenth Joules per cubic centimeter, which is reportedly
        sufficient to boil off the Earth's oceans in a matter of
        moments. </p>
      <p>Given access to such energies, it is small wonder that the
        Hutchison Effect produces such bizarre phenomena. At the present
        time, the phenomena are difficult to reproduce with any
        regularity.&nbsp; The focus for the future, then, is first to
        increase the frequency of occurrence of the effects, then to
        achieve some degree of precision in their control. </p>
      <p>The work is continuing at this time. Before long, we shall see
        what progress can be made. </p>

      <p> John Hutchison of Vancouver, Canada, tinkered with an array of
        simultaneously interactive fields; a combination of
        electrostatic, magnetic, microwave and Tesla Coil fields.
        Without predictable warning and with some randomness, these
        fields interacted with objects. Levitations, thrusted weights,
        glowing, apparent softening and bending of hard metal alloys,
        and strange alloy separations were some of the phenomena
        reported. Some events were witnessed and reported by George
        Hathaway." Additional details of the experiments are related in
        the <i>Electric Spacecraft Journal</i>. One series of
        experiments was performed while observers from Los Alamos
        Laboratory, U. S. aircraft firms, and military personnel
        observed and made video camera recordings. There is no doubt
        that things happened which were dffficult to explain. However,
        the experimental procedures were such that John Hutchison would
        try various combinations of pulsed power, microwaves, etc.,
        without records to correlate what caused what. The best that
        could be done at the time was to observe. There is no claim of
        electrogravitic forces here, but massive objects were said to
        have moved, presumably as a result of the externally applied
        fields. Mr. Hutchison claimed that the presence of heavy masses
        was important in his levitation experiments. The phenomenon
        generated by Mr. Hutchison requires more investigation. </p>

        <b>THE HUTCHISON EFFECT: A LIFT, DISRUPTION AND LUMINOUS ENERGY
          SYSTEM</b>
        <p><b>Albert Budden</b></p>
      </center>
      <p> The original way that Hutchison set out his range of apparatus
        was, by industrial standards, primitive and crowded, with poor
        connections and hand-wound coils. But it was with this layout
        with its erratic standards that he obtained most of the best
        examples of objects levitating, despite the fact that the
        maximum power drawn was 1.5 kilowatts, and this from the
        ordinary power sockets of the house mains. The Hutchison device
        produces effects which can basically be divided into two
        categories, propulsive and energetic. It can induce lift in
        objects made of any material and also propel them laterally. </p>
      <p>; It has been noted that there are four types of trajectory
        that affect objects weighing a few pounds, and all of these
        upward movements begin with a twisting spiral movement. Also,
        there has to be a particular geometry in relation to the
        direction of gravity, i.e., downwards of these objects, for them
        to be affected in this way. Some objects will not take off if
        you turn them on their sides, but will if you stand them on
        their ends. It is evident, therefore, that the relationship of
        their physical forms to the fields which swirl invisibly around
        them is important. Returning to the four modes of trajectory,
        first, there is the looping arc, where objects take off
        relatively slowly over a period of seconds, loop in the air and
        fall back to earth; then there is the ballistic take-off where
        objects shoot upwards suddenly, hit the ceiling and fall back
        down. A third type of trajectory is a powered one where there
        appears to be a continuous lifting force; and the fourth is
        where an object moves upwards and just hovers for some time. As
        mentioned, these objects can be of any material whatsoever ---
        wood, plastics, copper, zinc, Styrofoam, etc. It must be
        mentioned that 99 per cent of the time the objects do nothing at
        all, and one can wait for days before anything happens, but it
        is just this erratic unpredictability that one finds when
        investigating poltergeist activity. </p>
      <p>Another major area of activity is the disruptive phenomenon
        where materials are destroyed. Hutchison has a collection of
        metal samples which have been broken and/or deformed, indicating
        that high energy levels are involved, as mentioned before. As
        one may imagine, this device has attracted intense interest from
        a variety of professional, academic and industrial sources, not
        to mention covert military attention. In the USA, a respected
        and well-qualified electrical engineer, George Hathaway, has
        taken on the research and development of the device. As
        explained, although the device has many interrelated parts, it
        acts as a single entity. Of the disruptive effects on metals and
        other materials he relates: "The disruption part of
        this...system has produced confirmatory physical samples that
        include water, aluminum, iron, steel, molybdenum, wood, copper,
        bronze, etc... We have tested various pieces that have broken
        apart, for hardness, ductility, etc. We have used optical and
        electron microscopes. "Two samples of aluminum... one of which
        is twisted up in a left-handed spiral...and another which was
        blown into little fibres...molybdenum rods which are supposed to
        withstand temperatures of about 5,000 degrees F... We watched
        these things wiggle back and forth... In general, a collection
        of pieces of metal shows that they have been blasted apart or
        twisted..." </p>
      <p>In domestic settings where 'poltergeist' activity is usually
        observed, metal-bending and deformities take place with less
        vigour --- which is to be expected due to the accidental field
        configurations produced as electromagnetic pollution from power
        lines, radio transmitters, civilian radar, etc., interacts with
        Earth energies --- otherwise known as geomagnetic and
        geoelectric fields&amp;emdashat locations inadvertently built
        over fault lines. The following example taken from a well-known
        case in the UK --- the Enfield poltergeist --- shows a typical
        instance of metal- bending: "It was 10.15 am on 6 December 1977.
        Janet was leaning on the kitchen worktop, and her mother was
        sitting down. Both were out of reach of the stove. Suddenly,
        they both heard a noise coming from the teapot --- the same
        metal one that Grosse had seen rocking in front of his eyes. Mrs
        Harper picked up the pot and found that its stout metal lid had
        arched upwards, just as the spoons had done, bending right out
        of shape so that it no longer fitted the pot. I took the lid in
        both hands, and even using considerable force I was unable to
        bend it back." </p>
      <p>Hathaway, in his descriptions of metal deformity, clearly gives
        the impression of intense energies at work: "The largest piece
        [of metal] is about 12-13 inches long. It's two inches in
        diameter, of regular mild steel, and a 3/8 of an inch long part
        was blasted off the end and crumbled like a cookie." However,
        even the domestic 'poltergeist' displays phenomena where
        extremely high energy levels are involved, although in the
        following example, also from the Enfield case, we get the
        impression that more conventional high-magnetic-field densities
        are involved: "Mr Playfair...was already on his feet and
        standing in the doorway of their bedroom, wondering if he was
        seeing things. "The entire iron frame of the gas fire had been
        wrenched out of the wall, and was standing at an angle on the
        floor, still attached to the half-inch-diameter brass pipe that
        connected it to the mains. The pipe had been bent through an
        angle of thirty-two degrees. This was a major demolition job,
        for the thing was cemented into the brickwork, and it was out of
        the question to suggest that one of the children could have
        wrenched it out. When we finally dismantled the whole apparatus,
        we found it quite a job even to move. It must have weighed at
        least fifty pounds." [3] </p>
      <p>We may ask ourselves what new directions for investigation into
        'poltergeists' are open to us in the light of the Hutchison
        Effect. Startling as it may seem, an answer is there ready-made
        for us in the almost matter-of-fact information that Hathaway
        supplies: "Fragments have been analyzed and found to have an
        anomalously high silicon content, although the original material
        was not silicon steel...a standing piece is 5-6 inches tall, 1
        and 1/4 inches in diameter and is a piece of case-hardened
        steel... The case-hardening has been blown off at the top and
        about 3/4 of an inch of it vaporized during an experiment...a
        piece of iron was analyzed for composition which showed
        anomalously high amounts of copper...wood particles were also
        found inside a piece of aluminum..." </p>
      <p>Evidently, the energies involved are able to reorganize
        materials in a way that is virtually impossible by any other
        means, but we are now provided with a previously unheard-of
        perspective. From the Hutchison experiments, it is clear that an
        analysis of the composition of metals at the 'poltergeist' site,
        in order to detect similar mixture-anomalies, is an essential
        investigative procedure. Although we may shelve theories of
        psychokinesis and separate them out from 'poltergeist' activity
        as belonging to dice-throwing experiments or the spoon-bending
        of Uri Geller, the weird physical antics of the mixing and
        matching fields of the Hutchison Effect provide us with
        something far stranger. This underscores the point made earlier
        that although it sounds as if the enigma of the 'poltergeist' is
        being diminished by identifying it as electromagnetic field
        activity, in actual fact the mystery is merely being redirected.
        Physicists and electrical engineers should now reconsider the
        nature of severely modulated electromagnetic fields, for there
        are evidently previously unrealized potentials. The energies
        involved in the Hutchison Effect are clearly the same ones at
        work during 'poltergeist' activity, and it is only the ignorance
        and entrenched positions of the psychical research fraternity
        that prevent them from accepting these insights into
        electromagnetic energy potentials. These energies include weird
        thermal effects. During Hutchison's experiments, flames have
        been produced and emitted from blocks of concrete, and fires
        have broken out in different parts of the building where the
        device was housed. Again, these effects are typical of
        'poltergeist' reports. On one occasion, a steel file was held in
        place against a wooden board by two plywood struts, to prevent
        it taking off. The file glowed white-hot, but the board when
        examined afterwards was not even singed. Such mischievous
        thermal antics of 'phantom arsonists' have been attributed to
        the 'spirit energy of the poltergeist', whatever that may be,
        but Hathaway's warnings are more to do with effective safety
        practices in the laboratory: "From time to time there are scorch
        marks on the boards from other experiments. The apparatus makes
        fire spontaneously in parts of the lab, if you're not careful."
      </p>
      <p>The device can also induce unusual aurora-like lighting effects
        in mid-air. Once when Hutchison was filming in 1981, a sheet of
        iridescence suddenly descended between the camera and some of
        the hardware being used. It had a strange pinkish center to it,
        and after it hovered there for a short period it vanished just
        as suddenly as it had appeared. Hutchison actually thought he
        had been hallucinating, but when the film was developed it
        transpired that there had actually been something objective
        there. Once again, the Enfield case provides us with comparable
        examples of strange, luminous phenomena in a domestic setting,
        and in this extract they are accompanied by other typical
        phenomena also explainable within the Hutchison Effect: "The
        Harpers hoped to find some peace and quiet in the Burcombes'
        house, but it was not to be. From the kitchen Sylvie suddenly
        let out a piercing scream and dropped the kettle she was
        holding. It was some time before she could calm down enough to
        describe what had happened. 'I was just pouring the water from
        the kettle into the teapot,' she said, 'when something appeared
        right in front of my eyes and then dropped onto the kitchen unit
        top, and bounced once.' It was a plastic rod, about six inches
        long, from one of the children's toy sets. 'I sort of looked
        down, opened my eyes, and this thing was in front of me,' she
        told Grosse when he arrived shortly afterwards. 'I screamed,
        shouted and jumped back, and after I jumped back I saw the thing
        jump and come up again.' "Grosse questioned Mrs Burcombe very
        carefully about this incident, which seemed to be a genuine case
        of one of the rarest of all psychic phenomena: materialization.
        The plastic rod had definitely not been thrown at her, she
        insisted. It had just appeared in front of her eyes and dropped
        down... But he had already seen too much, in both his own and
        his sister's homes. He had watched open-mouthed as a lamp slowly
        slid across a table and fell to the floor, vibrating violently.
        He had seen a drawer open by itself. He had felt an invisible
        force stop him closing his own bedroom door, which simply stuck
        half-closed though it normally swung shut on its own. And he had
        seen something far more alarming as he stood one day at the
        bottom of the Harper's staircase, looking up it. 'I saw this
        light,' he said. 'It was the equivalent, I should say, of twelve
        inches vertical. It looked like a fluorescent light behind
        frosted glass, which burned fiercely and gradually faded
        away'..." [4] </p>
      <p>With the insights gained from what is possible during operation
        of the Hutchison device, coupled with my own findings that
        'poltergeist' activity takes place at locations that are
        electromagnetic hot-spots, we can begin to understand what is
        going on in such cases. Unusual light phenomena can occur, and
        on consulting Burke's <i>Handbook of Magnetic Phenomena</i> we
        find several mechanisms documented where magnetic fields
        interact with light to produce specific optical effects that are
        predictable in laboratory conditions, but are obviously most
        startling when they occur spontaneously in domestic settings.
        Having stated this, however, the sheet of iridescent light which
        appeared during Hutchison's experiments also came as an
        unexpected and surprising phenomenon. In the extract given
        above, it is not difficult to rethink the apparent
        materialization of the plastic rod as a typical trajectory of
        the Hutchison Effect, observed many times and recorded on video.
        Likewise, the lamp slowly sliding across the table and vibrating
        could have come straight out of the catalogue of effects
        similarly induced. In fact, compared with the extreme effects
        that Hutchison can obtain with his device, domestic
        'poltergeist' phenomena which previously seemed so dramatic, now
        seem quite tame. But as already noted, this lessening of effect
        is consistent with the fact that the Hutchison device involves a
        concentrated collection of devices which appear to act as a
        single entity, whereas an electromagnetic hot-spot occurs by the
        chance juxtaposition of freak environmental field sources.
        Unfortunately, the investigators present during the
        'poltergeist' activity at Green Street, Enfield, England, in the
        late 1970s, did not carry out a thorough field survey or
        identify the field sources involved, despite the fact that a
        magnetometer registered distinct deflections as objects were
        'thrown' across the room. In fact, there is the distinct
        impression that, for them, electromagnetic fields were not a
        welcome explanation for the phenomena they witnessed, as the
        Playfair book relates how they discontinued use of the
        magnetometer once it showed that power surges occurred in
        conjunction with physical phenomena: "When everybody was settled
        into bed, we switched on both tape recorders, Eduardo's being
        connected to the signal from the magnetometer, and left the
        room, since I had told him that nothing would happen if we both
        stayed there. From the landing we could keep an eye on the dial
        of the machine, and in the following forty minutes Janet's
        pillow was twice thrown across the room just as it had been the
        previous evening in my presence. This time, of course, I could
        not see Janet, although Mrs Harper assured me at once that she
        had not thrown it. And each time the needle on the magnetometer
        did indeed deflect, though Eduardo thought this might have been
        caused by creaking bedsprings." [5] </p>
      <p>It is difficult to understand how bedsprings could cause power
        surges strong enough to register on a magnetometer (I, myself,
        have used many types of these instruments during
        investigations), and even more difficult to understand how they
        could induce deflections which happened to coincide with the
        movements of objects. Also, it's a wonder the investigators did
        not eliminate this as an option, if they thought it was
        possible, by simply moving the instrument away from the
        bedsprings. Magnetometers are of course designed to withstand
        the effects of magnetic fields, and so it is even more puzzling
        why the following reasoning and actions were employed: "I was a
        little worried that he might have to go back to his university
        and report that the expensive instrument he had borrowed without
        permission had broken down, so we called off the experiment once
        we were satisfied that it seemed possible that there was some
        link between poltergeist activity and anomalous behavior of the
        surrounding magnetic field." [6] </p>
      <p>One of the primary investigators of the Green Street
        'poltergeist' in Enfield, North London, was Maurice Grosse, who
        has given many lectures on his experiences and is now regarded
        as one of the leading authorities on this kind of phenomenon. On
        the whole, 'poltergeists' are regarded as discarnate and
        mischievous entities who home in on the energies of an
        adolescent focus and who unintentionally wreak havoc wherever
        they go, although particular locations are usually favored for
        the most spectacular phenomena. In the course of my career as an
        investigator, I have discovered that 'poltergeist' activity
        takes place in electromagnetic hot- spots, and is
        electromagnetic in nature. However, 'poltergeist expert' Maurice
        Grosse takes a different view: "Albert's enthusiasm for his
        suppositions does him credit, but...displays a distinct lack of
        practical experience of psychic phenomena... I look forward with
        great interest to the day when flying boxes, stones, toys, heavy
        items of furniture, plus spontaneous fires and water phenomena,
        together with the passage of matter through matter, levitation,
        metal bending, to name just a few examples of poltergeist high
        jinks I have personally experienced, can be explained by
        electromagnetic and bioelectromagnetic activity."7 Well,
        Maurice, this is the day you have been waiting for! In fact, it
        was "the day" over 15 years ago when Guy Lyon Playfair's book on
        the Enfield 'poltergeist' was published in 1981 in the UK, when
        at the same time on the other side of the world in British
        Columbia, Canada, John Hutchison's device was just getting
        underway and generating all of the physical 'poltergeist'
        activity you were considering. </p>
      <p><b>ELECTROMAGNETIC HYPERSENSITIVITY</b> </p>
      <p>This is not the place to fully expound my own biological
        research into how the human body reacts to prolonged field
        exposure, except to say that the body eventually acts as an
        oscillator and can add to the electromagnetic mayhem generated
        at hot spots. That is to say, I would add to the Hutchison
        Effect by including my own findings, as outlined in my books,
        which point to 'poltergeists' being electromagnetic phenomena,
        and my conclusion that there is a bioelectromagnetic aspect
        where the human body behaves as another piece of electrical
        apparatus or hardware and re-radiates generalized ambient fields
        in more beam-like, coherent forms. This is a symptom of an
        increasingly common clinical condition known as electromagnetic
        hypersensitivity (EH), caused by exposure to electromagnetic
        pollution from power lines, transmitters, etc. The condition was
        the subject for an international conference of medical
        specialists and academics at Graz, Austria, in 1994. It is
        treated at the Breakspear Hospital in Hertfordshire, England.
        However, nobody in psychical research here in England seems to
        be aware of EH or the work of John Hutchison, and there are
        fixed ideas which are protected with a religious fervor. Freak
        electromagnetic field conditions which seem to stretch the laws
        of physics to almost breaking point are not a welcome
        conclusion, although the history of science is littered with
        painful upheavals where the established view is turned on its
        head, and iconoclasts like myself and, unwittingly, John
        Hutchison, threaten the status quo. For example, Dr John Beloff,
        the Editor of Anomaly, the respected journal of the Society of
        Psychical Research, wrote to me to tell me: "Whatever the
        relevance of exposure to EM radiation...it has no obvious
        bearing on psychic experiences in general." Having investigated
        reports of apparitions and 'poltergeists' in hot-spot locations
        for over three years, and measured the fields present with my
        trusty field meter, this statement made no sense at all. Perhaps
        the reader will have some inkling of the sort of establishment
        opposition I am up against, or may even refuse to believe the
        Hutchison Effect themselves. However, it must be remembered that
        a number of well-known electrical engineering organizations have
        been involved. For example, McDonnell-Douglas Aerospace and the
        Max Planck Institute in Germany, both took many photographs,
        some of which appear here. I anticipate that there will be a
        wave of controversy as a result of this article, if the
        reactions here in the UK are anything to go by, and I would be
        interested in any constructive suggestions that readers may
        have. </p>

      </p>
      <p>If you ask the other residents of a certain apartment building
        in Vancouver, they may admit to being curious about John
        Hutchison. They see a tall, muscular man who carts old consoles
        of electronic equipment onto the elevator nearly every week.
        Their curiosity increased the day a Japanese television crew
        showed up and disappeared inside his apartment for a few hours.
        And in the summer of 1995, Hutchison further puzzled onlookers
        by sitting on the curb and picking out stones, Why would a
        rockhound sort through ordinary street rocks? </p>
      <p>What the neighbors do not know is that John Hutchison is
        well-known in new-energy circles, and is even known to some who
        move in the circles of established science. His visitors have
        included distinguished physicists. But unlike Shoulders and
        Lambertson, he is a self-taught scientist. As a boy in
        Vancouver, he read about Nikola Tesla and then startled
        neighbors with Tesla coil experiments in his backyard. </p>
      <p>While in his twenties, he developed a medical problem that
        resulted in his living on a small disability pension. For years,
        he lived a generally reclusive life, digging for rare electrical
        equipment in military surplus stores and junkyards, and carrying
        his finds home on the city bus. Apart from time spent as a
        volunteer at a local ecology center, he spent hours in his
        bedroom-turned-laboratory, patiently rebuilding equipment. He
        considered opening a museum. </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Antigravity and the Hutchison Effect</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>Hutchison's life changed drastically in 1979 when, upon
        starting up an array of high-voltage equipment, he felt
        something hit his shoulder. He threw the piece of metal back to
        where it seemed to have originated, and it flew up and hit him
        again. This was how he originally discovered the Hutchison
        effect. When his Tesla coils, electrostatic generator, and other
        equipment created a complex electromagnetic field, heavy pieces
        of metal levitated and shot toward the ceiling, and some pieces
        shredded. </p>
      <p>What is the Hutchison effect? As with much of the new-energy
        field, no one can say for sure. Some theorists think the effect
        is the result of opposing electromagnetic fields cancelling each
        other out, creating a powerful flow of space energy. </p>
      <p>A Vancouver businessman heard about the Hutchison effect,
        contacted Hutchison, and brought in a consulting engineer to
        form a company that would promote technology developed from the
        effect. Despite demonstrations to potential customers from both
        Canada and the United States, things did not work out, and
        Hutchison and the company parted ways in 1986. </p>
      <p>After a couple of other abortive business tries, including a
        sojourn in Germany, Hutchison returned to Vancouver in late 1990
        and again lived a relatively reclusive life. Piece by piece, he
        sold what remained of his laboratory equipment in order to pay
        his bills. It would be several years before he could reestablish
        his collection. </p>
      <p>Hutchison wanted to connect with other researchers, but the
        local media had given his work the weird-science treatment, and
        didn't take him seriously. However, material on the Hutchison
        effect was included in a Japanese book on Hutchison's life and
        work that sold well in Japan. Living in a country with almost no
        natural resources has led the Japanese to take new-energy ideas
        very seriously, as we will see in Chapter 8. </p>
      <p>As a result, Hutchison was asked to speak in Japan, where
        thousands of people paid to attend his two lecture tours. These
        tours were organized by Hiroshi Yamabe, a well-known Tesla
        lecturer who made his fortune in such advanced engineering
        fields as robotics and artificial intelligence. Yamabe offered
        to set up a laboratory for Hutchison, but the Canadian was
        ambivalent about the prospect of moving to Japan. </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Beyond the Hutchison Effect: The Dirt Cheap
            Energy Converter</font></b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hutchison was undecided about what to do. He
        had moved beyond the Hutchison effect and into the field of
        space energy, and had acquired a Canadian business manager. The
        winter before his 1995 Japanese tour, Hutchison built a working
        space energy device about the size of a microwave oven. The
        Hutchison Converter was based on Tesla's resonance principle.
        Tesla demonstrated this principle by steadily pulsing bursts of
        energy into his electric coils, each burst coming before energy
        from the previous burst had time to die away. This led to higher
        and higher amounts of energy, like a child going higher and
        higher on a swing. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hutchison captured the same pulsing,
        rhythmic energy by using crystals of barium titanate, a material
        that can capture the pulses of certain electromagnetic
        frequencies in the way that a radio can pick up certain radio
        frequencies. When the crystal pulses, or resonates, it produces
        electric power. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a demonstration in which the converter
        put out six watts, enough to power a motor that kept a small
        propeller spinning furiously. The whirring of a tiny propeller
        looked rather silly, until one realized that the apparatus
        contained no batteries, no fuel, and no connection to a power
        outlet It worked continuously for months. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day while experimenting, however,
        Hutchison cracked a crucial part and decided to take the unit
        apart. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He built a smaller, more portable model to
        take on his speaking tour. Resembling an Oscar statue in size
        and shape, the portable converter put out slightly more than a
        watt of power. It lit a tiny lamp as a demonstration and also
        ran a small motor. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the tour, in front of an
        audience of about 500 Hiroshima residents, Hutchison slapped the
        device onto a table lit by the bright lights of a television
        crew. He quickly unscrewed all the parts and revealed its inner
        details, while the camera zoomed in for a closeup and a pair of
        chopsticks provided a scale to show the size of the device. It
        was clear that the converter contained no batteries. Afterward,
        men crowded around Hutchison, offering him their business cards
        and asking him to sell them a supply of barium titanate. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back home, Hutchison's business advisor
        fretted that the inventor had given away his secrets. But
        Hutchison shrugged his shoulders; he had gone beyond the
        prototype technology he had taken to Japan. He now had a new
        secret - the stovetop process he called Dirt Cheap because the
        ingredients included common rocks. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new process grew out of his use of
        barium titanate. He wondered, "Why can't I make a material that
        works even better?" Hutchison knew that other researchers had
        put electrodes on certain rocks to show that the rocks generated
        a tiny electric current, somehow soaked up from the cosmos. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Hutchison sorted through small stones on
        the street in front of his apartment and threw them into a test
        tube-sized metal container. Next, he added a mixture of
        low-cost, common chemicals, he won't reveal which ones and put
        this rock soup on the stove to simmer. This allowed water to
        evaporate and tiny pockets of air to rise from the stones so
        that the chemicals could enter them. Before the mixture cooled
        into a solid, he added specially treated posts to draw
        electricity from the crystal-like substance th at had formed.
        Again, no one is entirely sure as to how the Dirt Cheap method
        works, although one physicist told Hutchison that the Casimir
        effect, used by Ken Shoulders to create charge clusters, may be
        at work (see page 61). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he first discovered his Dirt Cheap
        process, Hutchison didn't bother to patent it. He had heard from
        other inventors how their laboratories had been vandalized and
        their property had been stolen once the Patent Office had been
        notified, and he was not eager to be the first inventor to take
        a bold step by manufacturing a large home- or factory-sized unit
        that could restructure industries. Besides, in the 1980s ---
        when he was still working with the Hutchison effect --- he had
        received a few threatening comments from strangers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How could Hutchison enjoy his peaceful life
        and still get a space energy product to the public in a low-key
        manner? He says he has hit upon an unusual strategy: building
        miniature flying saucers powered by Dirt Cheap-supplied
        electricity, and selling them as space-energy children's toys.
        Hutchison hopes an environmentally safe toy that lights up
        without batteries will intrigue the public into buying Dirt
        Cheap devices that could power large appliances. And perhaps,
        the Dirt Cheap process could help lead to a world of
        nonpolluting new energy. <br>

            humorous wink in his intelligent eyes. Right under the CIA
            decorated door eye was a sign stating:</font> </p>

          comes into life and lights the red LED. The LED is connected
          to the battery without series resistor so the idle voltage
          stated as 18 volts apparently drops down to the red LED
          operating voltage of some two volts with load connected. <i>"I

            "Hutchison effect" is used except about John's levitation
            experiments also about these weird pieces of metal. John
            tells that the deformations have taken place in room
            temperature as a result of a complex combination of
            electromagnetic fields. Left above: Steel. Left below:

        <p><font color="#000000"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Getting the
              effects is like opening an electromagnetic combination
              lock. I was actually so busy with adjusting the controls
              that I had no time to observe how the test pieces behaved
              in the combination of fields."</i> About his levitation
            and cold melting H-effects John likes to think their origin
            connected with external dimensions. This explanation is
            fascinating. Now one may be manipulating with some
            Interdimensional wormholes within matter and it's basic
            particles.</font> </p>

        </center>
        <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, an
            alternative way of explaining the cold melting appears in
            visitor's mind. When exposing the object to a combination of
            electromagnetic fields with many frequencies simultaneously
            one actually may be trying to hit as many of the atom's
            orbital or nuclear resonances as possible.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as the atom is
            busy oscillating by itself and trying to stay in one piece
            under the strain of excess energy, it has other things to
            worry about than trying to keep tight bonds with neighboring
            atoms. While experimenter turns more power and hits more of
            it's resonances, the outer electrons responsible for
            metallic bonds start to shake themselves loose from other
            atoms and they start to slide past each other. The result is
            a soft, trembling jelly of metal.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fields are
            cut off, the metal pieces of cause calm down after it's
            momentary nightmare of what appeared like melting in
            comfortable, cool room temperature. Metallic bonds settle
            for their familiar firm handshake with neighboring atoms
            with the resulting deformations John just showed - the
            Hutchison Effect.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John states that
            today he co-operates only with some distinguished U.S.
            scientists like Ken Shoulders. Indeed, when thinking it
            closely these John's experiments may have something in
            common with Shoulders' discovery about electron cluster
            sparks which seem to have some non-heating means of taking
            matter apart.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Shoulders, the
            energy of an electric spark is less than what is required
            for melting equal amount of substance. So the electron
            packet or cluster present in sparks is obviously having some
            alternative means of loosening atomary bonds within matter
            than heating. Here we have a connection to John's cold
            melting effects with electromagnetic fields and high
            voltage. For more information about Shoulders' electron
            cluster, see his fine description, "Charge Clusters In
            Action".</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With one
              levitation experiment the object started to vertically
              circle around in the air."</i> We tried to explain this
            due to interference in the field due to slight instrument
            frequency wobbling or drifting. About possible changes in
            object inertial mass in his levitation experiments John
            could not tell.</font> </p>

          <h3>Successful Replication of The Hutchison Effect</h3>
        </center>
        <center><b>by</b>
          <p><b>Mark Solis &amp; John Hutchison</b> </p>
          <p><b>( October 10, 1998 )</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two important aspects of the Hutchison
          Effect have been confirmed independently by scientific
          researchers Richard Hull and Ken Shoulders. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical investigations by Richard Hull
          of the early development of the Farnsworth Fusion Machine have
          uncovered independent confirmations by several of the
          researchers on the project that solid metal portions of the
          apparatus became transparent on a number of occaisions.&nbsp;
          In one such case, the red plasma filaments were visible
          through the ion guns, giving the impression that the ion beams
          were standing in mid-air, as if physically outside the system,
          though they were not. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spontaneous invisibility of materials in
          the "active zone" of a Pharos-type Hutchison apparatus is also
          a characteristic of the Hutchison effect. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These events regarding the Farnsworth
          Fusor were reported in Electric Spacecraft Journal. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicist Ken Shoulders, who has an
          excellent reputation as a theoretician and experimenter, has
          successfully replicated the anomalous localized heating
          effects of the Hutchison Effect. These effects often involve
          the spontaneous breakage of metals under what appears to be
          extreme thermal stress, and yet there is no evidence of the
          presence of heat in adjoining materials, where under normal
          circumstances one would expect scorching or carbon scoring, at
          the very least. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Ken Shoulders has succeeded in
          proposing a viable theoretical explanation for these effects,
          and is now working to fully confirm the theory. <br>

            Saturday, 18 March 2000, that John Hutchison has been raided
            at gunpoint by Canadian Police.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">John's apartment in New Westminster,
            British Columbia, was raided at 2 PM Friday, 17 March 2000,
            by gun-wielding police searching for firearms. An antique
            gun collection</font> <br>
          <font color="#000000">owned by Hutchison was confiscated in
            its entirety.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">According to Hutchison, a phone call
            was received at about 2 PM Friday, stating that it was the
            police, and asking John to answer his door. Hutchison states
            that there were 8 to 10 individuals pointing weapons at him,
            only two or three of whom were in uniform. The rest were
            dressed in dark clothing.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Hutchison was handcuffed and placed on
            the outside steps while police searched the apartment.&nbsp;
            No warrant was claimed or shown at any time. Police stated
            only that there had been an anonymous complaint that
            firearms were being brought into the apartment.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Police also called in an "electrical
            inspector" to examine John's lab equipment. This is the
            famous "Hutchison apparatus" with which John produces the
            renowned "Hutchison Effect."</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Additional individuals dressed in suits
            were brought in who took extensive photographs of the
            Hutchison apparatus. Hutchison indicates that these persons
            had an "official air"</font> <br>
          <font color="#000000">about them, and that they might be
            Government agents, especially given the confiscation of the
            original Hutchison lab, which took place while John was out
            of the country in 1990. None of these persons showed any
            identification.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">Those who have followed John's career
            of invention and innovation will recall that his first
            laboratory was forcibly seized by the Canadian Government on
            24 February 1990 by</font> <br>
          <font color="#000000">the direct order of former Canadian
            Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The Government has retained
            the lab in spite of a court order by Judge Paris of the
            Supreme Court of British Columbia to return it.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">A previous raid on John Hutchison's
            apartment involving his collection of antique firearms
            occured in 1978, and processing took two years. The
            confiscated antiques were returned at the order of Judge
            Cronin. These events occurred under the administration of
            former PM Pierre Trudeau. Former PM Joe Clark, who took over
            in the 1980s following the Trudeau administration, wrote to
            Hutchison offering help and support.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">The present raid follows close on the
            heels of a recent successful levitation performed 11 October
            1999 which was videotaped by John. The effect was achieved
            after six days</font> <br>
          <font color="#000000">worth of attempts.</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">However, neighbors called local police
            to complain about Hutchison's experiment.&nbsp; It is
            unclear whether something in their apartment levitated,
            although there is no other way known at this time that they
            could have been aware of the levitation experiment that was
            in progress. The neighbors in question live across the
            street from Hutchison.The sound of approaching sirens was
