"The Reciprocal System of physical theory (“RS” theory) was created by
chemical engineer Dewey B. Larson during the 1940s to 1950s, after
noticing that properties of the elements in the Periodic Table could be
easily determined if one were to assume that time had three dimensions,
instead of one. Larson realized that these three, temporal dimensions
had the same properties as our three, conventional spatial dimensions,
which led him to the conclusion that there were actually three
dimensions of space/time, each dimension of space pairing up with a
dimension of time as a ratio. The inverse relation of space to time is
what is commonly called speed (miles per hour, meters per second, etc),
or in a more general sense, motion. By assuming that motion rather than
matter was the actual building block of Nature, he was able to deduce
the structure of our physical universe through natural consequences,
from the smallest particle to the largest galaxy."
