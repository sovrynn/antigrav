So this displays the rate of changes between 2 of x variables. If you have 3 space and 1 time coordinate, you'll need 16 numbers, one for each pair. It's bidirectional, so its symmetric.

Notice how it all adds up to 0.

With 1 space and 1 time coordinate...

No with 1 time coordinate, you've only got ... 2?

No you always need a space coordinate. Even a single point in space will have this flux.

Time -> Time (contained in the point)

Time -> point +- point -> time

# Example in 1 dimension of space and 1 dimension of time

In a given area

T00 = energy density (the amount of stuff)

T01 = energy flux in +x (how much the energy is flowing into motion?) Or how its moving within the volume?

T10 = momentum density wh
