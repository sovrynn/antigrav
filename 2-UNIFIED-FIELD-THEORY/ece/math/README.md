# Curvilinear coordinates

"In geometry, curvilinear coordinates are a coordinate system for Euclidean space in which the coordinate lines may be curved. These coordinates may be derived from a set of Cartesian coordinates by using a transformation that is locally invertible (a one-to-one map) at each point. This means that one can convert a point given in a Cartesian coordinate system to its curvilinear coordinates and back. The name curvilinear coordinates, coined by the French mathematician Lam√©, derives from the fact that the coordinate surfaces of the curvilinear systems are curved."

# Full Summary

## Step 1: Einstein

So, R = kT is the equation used by Einstein to describe the curvature of space.

R denotes the (tensor of) curvature, T the (tensor of) energy-momentum density, and k is a proportionality constant.

Apparently this uses curvilinear coordinates, which goes back to Riemann.

So curvature describes only a subset of vectors in a manifold - it describes only the vectors that lie ON the manifold.

## Step 2: Cartan

Cartan modified this to employ considerations of EXTRINSIC curvature. This means vectors can vary within and normal to a point's manifold tangent plane.

Cartan showed that this EXTRINSIC curvature of space-time could be taken to represent electromagnetism.

He developed the "tetrad" which models the manifold's extrinsic curvature.

In the 3-dimensional case, this reduces to a Cartesian-coordinate "triad" which moves along with a point in space.

Unification not yet achieved.

## Step 3: Evans

Apparently Evans found the unifying connection via the spin field or B^3 field. This was inspired by the Inverse Faraday Effect (decisive evidence) - the magnetization of matter by a beam of circular-polarized electromagnetic radiation.

The Inverse Faraday Effect was derived by Evans directly from first principles and inferred the existence of a previously unknown magnetic field component - the B^3 field.

It is supposed to be a general-relativistic (gravity?) correction to classical electrodynamics.

# TODO

It would be good to construct this theory in 2d first. Or maybe even 1D.
