# ECE (Einstein Cartan Evans)

I think this is the one. It has a ton of research behind it (including the Germans and Chinese and Spanish).

It "fits the bill", so to say.

It's still mathy.

# My own summary of it

So this is a really interesting UFT and I think it's the most promising - I don't like the Chinese one.

It basically reduces all major theories into torsion curvature equations. Every gravitational force field, every electrostatic force field, is described in the same way.

One of the things I don't like is that it includes time as an axis in spacetime, but then it also solves this by making the world itself a fluid flow of ether.

The main equation modeling all of this is the Bianchi Identity:

DT = Rq

So the derivative of torsion is equal to the curvature times the tetrad.

# How would you relate the forces?

ECE theory proposes:
- Gravitation is a force field which includes mass and acceleration, and inertial force
- Coulomb's law is an electric force field which includes charge and electric acceleration
- Magnetism is a force field which includes magnetic charge/mass and magnetic acceleration.

# A discussion of criticisms

There's a page dedicated to this on their site

lol "Convoluted mathematical nonsense has been presented (and periodically repackaged) as critical analysis that gives the impression of mathematical errors in ECE theory where they do not exist."
