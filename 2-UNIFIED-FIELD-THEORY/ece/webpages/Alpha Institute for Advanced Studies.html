A new paradigm in physics (after 100 years of standstill)</h2>
<p>
</p><h3>A Synopsis of the AIAS and ECE Theory</h3>
<p>
The Alpha Institute for Advanced Studies (AIAS) is an intellectually 
independent institute of theoretical physics. It was founded by Myron 
Wyn Evans (1950-2019) and Jean-Pierre Vigier (1920-2004) in 1998, 
bringing together the insights and advances being made in the fields of 
computer simulation, chemical physics, theoretical physics and 
non-Euclidean geometry, such as tensor and Clifford algebra, that would 
promote the establishment and development of ECE theory. Its fundamental
 philosophy is the pursuit of objective truth through the scientific 
method (and therefore its models are required to account for all of the 
data).
</p><p>
Prior to ECE theory, Dr. Evans, D.Sc., Ph.D. (1977, 1974; University College of Wales, Aberystwyth)
published over 500 refereed articles and books, in mainstream journals and through mainstream
publishers (please see the “Omnia Opera” (Collected Works) on aias.us).
</p><p>
ECE theory unifies gravitation, electrodynamics and quantum mechanics through Cartan geometry. The
first fifteen papers of this theory were published in the journal Foundations of Physics Letters (Kluwer;
Prof. Alwyn van der Merwe, Editor) between 2003 and 2005, and were refereed between forty and fifty
times. In the spirit of scientific cooperation and collaboration, the complete ECE/UFT series (which now
numbers over 450 papers and books) is openly available on the aias.us website (with the help of David
Burleigh, Annexa.net).
</p><p>
Dr. Evans developed ECE theory with help mainly in the form of numerical processing support (all
significant mathematical developments are checked by computer algebra) and theoretical discussions
with Dr. Horst Eckardt, and Douglas Lindstrom and other members of the AIAS.
</p><p>
Dr. Eckardt was the co-author of most of the UFT papers and the primary authority with respect to
applied aspects. He is now the author of the continuing UFT series, the principal expert in ECE theory,
and the Director of the AIAS.
