So, the very name of this theory is Einstein Cartan Evans theory. Who are these people?

We know Einstein. Lived from 1879 to 1955.

Elie Cartan was a French mathematician who lived from 1869 to 1951. "Cartan geometry". Not sure if he also contributed to the physics side.

Myron Wyn Evans who is apparently dead now (T.T) lived from 1950 to 2019. Welsh, so he's from Ireland I think. He is supposed to be the big boy in this theory.
