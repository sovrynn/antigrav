A reputable whistleblower has proposed that there is a classified unified-field physics model. He describes it with the following attributes:

The physics theories in academia are "grossly in error".

Relativity theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics are terribly outdated.

The new theory does not begin with physical observables. Rather, it postulates the existence of an underlying reality consisting of an inherently unobservable subtle substance called an ether, which fills all space. It then defines all of its fundamental quantities at that subphysical level.

Physical observables then emerge as mathematical solutions to equations defined in terms of these more basic ether processes.

This new physics regards time and space as ABSOLUTES and views Einstein's notion of relative time and space as fundamentally INCORRECT.

Physically observable phenomena such as length contraction and clock retardation, normally interpreted as alterations of the space-time continuum, emerge as manifestations resulting from MOTION through the absolute ether.

This ether physics embraces:
- TT Brown's electrogravitics phenomenon along with additional classified research (Philadelphia experiment?)
- Phenomena discovered by Tesla (Coulomb waves?)

I want you to search for all possible explanations regarding the specifics of this theory. Since the theory is specifically said not to be covered by academia, I want you to focus more on fringe sources.
