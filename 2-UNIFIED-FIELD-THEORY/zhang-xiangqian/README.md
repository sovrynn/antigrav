# Zhang Xiangqian

Can you imagine if the unified field theory ends up being shared from China?

I trust this paper as it... seems concise in substance. Still, I think the explanation is insufficient.

It is true, however, that there is an entire book written on it by the same person.

## Final Verdict

My general verdict is that the ECE theory is likely superior to this theory.

I have no idea whether the alien abduction to Guoker planet is real, and it may be that this version of the theory is even more advanced than the ECE theory, but this theory just seems more elementary.

They could still be describing the exact same thing in different ways. But the explanations in this theory are also not perfectly clear, they are a bit jumbly.

It could be very high-quality word salad based on piecing together other works that were available at the time.

### Notes on the Chinese paper

Momentum formula: p = m(c-v)

As I understand:
- p: momentum
- m: mass
- c: speed of light
- v: velocity

I understand the basic units of the theory. But let's see, shouldn't we be able to plug in values and easily verify this?

### Zhang Xiangqian

Okay, this fellow is more interesting than I first imagined. He is 69 years old, and apparently, he had his first inspiration for this theory via an extraterrestrial encounter at age 18.

Zhang Xiangqian, born in 1967 in Anhui Province, China, presents one of the most unconventional stories in theoretical physics. Despite having only a middle school education and a background in farming and welding, Zhang claims to have developed a comprehensive Unified Field Theory following an extraordinary event in 1985, when, at the age of 18, he allegedly had contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.

According to Zhang, this encounter provided him with profound insights into the universe's fundamental nature, including advanced knowledge about space, time, mass, charge, and the four fundamental forces. This claimed extraterrestrial knowledge forms the foundation of his Unified Field Theory, which he has been developing and refining since this encounter.

While mainstream physics has historically dismissed such extraordinary claims, Zhang's works have been published in various formats, including books available on Amazon and papers on platforms like SSRN. His theory has begun attracting attention in certain circles, though it remains largely outside the established scientific consensus.
