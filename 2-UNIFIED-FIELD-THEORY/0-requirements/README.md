# Requirements of a unified field theory

A unified field theory should do the following 3 things:
- Provide basic definitions for concepts such as mass
- Explain all classically defined mechanics such as projectile motion, gravity, electromagnetism, basic force mass acceleration, etc
- Explain all anomalous observable phenomena such as quantization, clock retardation, etc

# Prompt

I want to develop a unified field theory of physics that ties together gravity, electromagnetism, and space. The theory should follow this general idea:

"First we need to understand what the word "field" means in the context of physics. A field essentially is an object that assigns a value for each point in space and time. So if you have a set of properties that you are interested in, then the field would tell you what their exact values are for all of time and space. Basically, it is a function where you input your position in space and time, and out pops all the physical information you could possibly want to know about that position.

A unified field theory would then encompass some sort set of principles, axioms and equations that would tell you what the field is for all space and time and tell you how it behaves under changes in its parameters. In principle it would provide some predictive capability given some initial input.

The popular discussion of unified field theory centers around the desire to find a theory that can describe how the universe behaves under the action of the four known forces: Strong, Electromagnetic, Weak and Gravity. Historically, the archetypical unification model is Maxwell's success in unifying the electric and magnetic forces into the electromagnetic force."

The theory should explain pretty much everything, including but not limited to:
- superconducting
- particle wave duality
- quantization

Give me a complete and comprehensive list of all physical phenomena, and also theoretical processes such as clock retardation or length contraction, that must be explained by a unified field theory of physics.

Don't include speculative phenomena.

Yes, you can categorize the list.

No, do not include cosmic inflation or galaxy formation as these are mostly speculative. You are free to include anything observed and theoretically grounded.
