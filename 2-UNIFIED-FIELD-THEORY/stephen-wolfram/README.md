The theory he shares in the talk here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad07iRVGwP0 is quite interesting. As I understand, it's not new, he's just giving a talk on his old work here. But it provides a meta-framework for an ether-based unified field model described by the whistleblower.

I greatly resonate with this approach as I have always believed in a computing-approach to understanding "physics" and humans. I think this meta-framework is powerful because it's completely different than trying to manufacture physics in a human brain versus creating a general purpose sandbox, generalizable, that can accomodate whatever it needs to accomodate and also include only the level of abstractions that you want to deal with.

I like what he says. He's obviously got pride in his work.

He's got a blog! https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/

## His unlab video goes to 1:10, then it's QnA

It would be good to see whether such an approach has been applied to physics and shared publicly.
