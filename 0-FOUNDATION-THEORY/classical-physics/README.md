# Classical Physics

Let's get a basic understanding of the basic forces seen in physics, which must all be explained by unified field theory.

In classical physics the four fundamental forces are categorized as:

1. Gravity: Described by Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
2. Electromagnetism: Described by Maxwell’s classical electromagnetism and quantum electrodynamics (QED).
3. Weak Nuclear Force: Responsible for processes like beta decay and described by electroweak theory.
4. Strong Nuclear Force: Invented ad hoc and detailed in a theory called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which regards the behavior of so-called quarks and gluons within atomic nuclei.

## Weak Nuclear Force

What is this?

"The weak force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, most famously beta decay in atomic nuclei. For example, it allows a neutron to turn into a proton (or vice versa), emitting an electron (or positron) and a neutrino in the process."

# Newton's 3 Laws

1. Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)

    An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.

2. Newton’s Second Law (Law of Acceleration)

    The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting upon it and its mass.

3. Newton’s Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)

    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

# Planck equation

The Planck equation usually refers to the formula that describes the energy of a photon or the Planck’s law of blackbody radiation.
