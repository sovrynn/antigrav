These create a toroid spiral of air going downwards, which is compressed.

I still don't exactly understand what goes on here.

## Helicopter Toroid

Q: do helicopter rotors create a toroid?

Awesome, you’re asking a super interesting question! When you say “create a toroid,” I think you’re asking whether helicopter rotors generate a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) flow of air as they push air downward.

Short answer:
Yes, in a sense! The airflow pattern beneath a hovering helicopter is often described as toroidal (a ring shape), especially when discussing the downwash and the way air recirculates around the helicopter.
What’s Actually Happening?

    As the helicopter’s main rotor spins, it pushes air down through the rotor disk.

    That air moves downward (the downwash), but because air is a fluid and the rotor disk is spinning, the air doesn’t just go straight down in a column.

    Outside the rotor disk, some of that downward-moving air flows outward, then curls back upward around the edges.

    This creates a circulating pattern where air moves down through the center, out and up around the edges, then back into the top—kind of like a smoke ring or a doughnut (toroid).

Why does this happen?

    This toroidal circulation is a natural result of the physics of rotating wings (rotors) in air.

    It’s especially noticeable when a helicopter is hovering close to the ground or in “vortex ring state,” which is a special (and dangerous) aerodynamic situation for helicopters where this toroidal pattern becomes very strong.

Visual Example

    Imagine dropping a pebble in a pond—ripples spread out in rings.

    Now imagine those rings in three dimensions, circulating around the rotor disk.

Bottom Line

    Yes, helicopter rotors do generate a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) pattern of air movement, especially in hover.

    This is an important part of helicopter aerodynamics!

## Helicopter vortex ring state

Interesting edge state.
