# Things to understand

1. What the fuck is magnetism? The iron filings show that there is some kind of toroid, but how does a magnet cause that? What's the tiny force that is going on?

2. Boyd Bushman's reverse oriented, tightly screwed magnets reducing the gravity effect.

# Things to stop doing

I need to stop viewing the world in the conventional model of things - mechanics. Objects. Division.

We are literally part of the Earth. There is no boundary between our body and the air. Our body is literally porous and filled with air and water.

Birds don't "fly" - they do something, they are part of something, that takes them higher.
