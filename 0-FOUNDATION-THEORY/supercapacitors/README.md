# Supercapacitors

Supercapacitors:
- Activated carbon: enormous microscopic surface area (thousands of mÂ² per gram)
- Ionic electrolytes: ultra-thin effective separation (nanometers), giving capacitances in the farads range in handheld sizes.
- Graphene and carbon nanotubes: similar principle, very high conductivity + surface area.
