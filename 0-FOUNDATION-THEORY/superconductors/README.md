# They not only levitate, they hang

Superconductors can hang under magnets without touching it. This can be seen in the superconductor train track videos where the track spirals around.

I have no idea how this works, the mechanism is clearly not that the magnetic field is simply "expelled" from the interior

# Two properties

A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity with zero electrical resistance when it is cooled below a certain critical temperature. This means that once electric current starts flowing in a superconductor, it can keep going indefinitely without losing any energy as heat. This is very different from regular conductors (like copper), which always have some resistance and waste some energy.

Superconductors also have another cool property: they expel magnetic fields from their interior, a phenomenon called the Meissner effect. This is why you might see videos of superconductors making magnets float above them (magnetic levitation).

# What metals are superconductors

Some elements

Lead (Pb)

Mercury (Hg)

Aluminum (Al)

Tin (Sn)

Niobium (Nb) (actually, niobium is special—it’s the element with the highest critical temperature)

But also some alloys.

# These properties are connected (obviously).

It seems there is still not a proper explanation for why superconductors have these properties.
