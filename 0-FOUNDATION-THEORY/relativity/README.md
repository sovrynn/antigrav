# Relativity

The most useful thing to understand from relativity is probably the way time relates to space and gravity.

"Relativity, in physics, refers to Albert Einstein's theories that revolutionized our understanding of space, time, gravity, and the universe. It encompasses two main theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with the relationship between space and time for observers in uniform motion, while general relativity describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime."
