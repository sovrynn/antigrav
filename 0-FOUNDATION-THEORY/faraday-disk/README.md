One of the earliest forms of electric generators, generating DC current.

Uncharged conducting plate spinning in a perpendicular magnetic field creates a radial flow of current from the center of the conducting plate to the rim.

I can actually understand how this works now... how interesting.

THE CONDUCTING PLATE IS UNPOWERED BUT IT GEENRATES CURRENT SIMPLY THROUGH SPINNING IN A MAGNETIC FIELD!!!

This provides a whole new angle to analyze rotating craft.
