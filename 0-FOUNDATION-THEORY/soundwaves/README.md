What interests me the most here is how acoustic levitation works.

Good link:

Basically, waves move because they're just particles bumping into each other, creating areas of high/low pressure as particles are compressed-expanded (that is what the wave is, the compression/dilution of particles over space and time).

When you make waves crash into each other head-on, you can create "standing waves" - waves that suspend in midair - creating constant areas of high/low pressure.
