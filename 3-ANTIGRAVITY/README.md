# Antigravity

The most well-substantiated invention on this is the Graviflyer by Alexey Chekurkov. There has been enough shared on this to assume that his invention is not a hoax, and that it does work. Other historic references include Nazi technology and Vimanas.

We must assume that this technology is already in the hands of governments, and that Alexey's invention is nothing more than a hobbyist toy in the eyes of governments.

# Leads

Look at ECE theory and addendum works (promising)

Look at electro-diamagnetic field (@ufobot)

# Issues

Okay, unified field theory creates some mathematical equations which "show" that everything is a single field but it's not clear to me how to then engineer a device that can counteract a gravitational force

Need to work more

# Basic ideas

It will be necessary to avoid getting confused and distracted by the mountain of word-salad and completely unsubstantiated legless theorization that fills the Internet information pipes.

It seems that the basic components include the forces of electromagneticism and gravity, but conventional physics cannot explain this, which is why we need to delve into the unified field theory. We need to get past objects and particles and instead work with a unified field and "aether".

The key is to understand the relationship between gravity, electromagnetism, and space.

# Graviflyer

It seems Alexey does not even understand exactly how his own craft works. He has published many videos (in Russian) and while it's clear that he has done extensive research on the topic spanning many years and much effort, he still fails to clearly explain why his craft works.

In his own words, the basic principles he works with are:
- Electromagnetic fields at certain frequencies can reduce or cancel gravity.
- Interference of waves (like Tesla coils) can push away gravity.
- Fast rotating fields can create lifting forces.
- Sound/ultrasound at the right frequencies can help things levitate.
