What we interpret to be "sound"

Are actually just pressure waves in air of a certain frequency

Anyways like all things, such a wave can cause electromagnetic effects - for example, if it interacts with a conducting/conductive medium, modifying the structure of magnetic/electric wave/particles

Why did Ultrasound buzzing from the top, resonant... did it also cause the discs to vibrate? WHat kind of effect would that have had on their electromagnetic fields?

How do you transfer electrical charge without sparking? I don't understand this. Because what was separating those discs was a dielectric (air).
