<h2><a name="0"></a><u>Effect explanation</u></h2>

<p>Ion thrust occuring during corona discharge due to
interraction of ions with medium has following steps :</p>

<ul>
    <li>1) Ionization of air molecules near electrode with high
        field&nbsp;intensity near to it (the small electrode, the
        wire in the lifter).&nbsp; Lets call it
        "emitter" for simplicity. </li>
    <li>2) Acceleration of ionized molecules by electric field in
        direction of&nbsp; wide electrode, let's call it
        "collector". </li>
    <li>3) Transmission of momentum from accelerated molecules to
        outside air </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's apply all this 3 steps to cases with different polarity.
First lets make "emitter" positive.&nbsp; </p>

<ul>
    <li>1) We will have ionization of air to cathion-radicals or
        cations such&nbsp; as N2+ N2+*.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>2) Positive particles will be accelerated in direction of
        negative&nbsp; electrode (collector) </li>
    <li>3) Momentum is transmitted from accelerated positive
        particles in&nbsp; direction of collector. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now lets reverse polarity and make "emitter"
negative. </p>

<ul>
    <li>1) We will have ionization of air to anion-radicals or
        anions such as&nbsp; N2- N2-*.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>2) Negative particles will be accelerated in direction of
        positive&nbsp; electrode (collector) </li>
    <li>3) Momentum is transmitted from accelerated negative
        particles in&nbsp; direction of collector. </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, momentum is transmitted in direction of
collector.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="center"><strong>**** Thrust is applied TO the electrode
which has charge carriers&nbsp; available near to it. <br>
With other words, thrust is directed to electrode with higher
field intensity near to it. </strong><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Direction
of thrust&nbsp; does not depend on polarity</strong></font><strong>
********** </strong></p>

<p>Now, what about magnitude of thrust, depending on polarity? It
depend on the ionization energy for particular positive or
negative&nbsp;ions. </p>

<p>Energy for reaction N2 + e -&gt;N2- and energy for reaction
N2- e-&gt;N2+&nbsp; are different (the second is lower),
therefore current and magnitude&nbsp;of thrust with negative
emitter is slightly lower than that with&nbsp;positive emitter.
This indeed has been observed by some of
lifter&nbsp;experimentalist, particularly by Cristian Marinescu <br>
( see <a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lfreplog.htm">http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lfreplog.htm</a>
). </p>

<p>Second conclusion related to the form of electrodes of
electric propulsion devices:&nbsp; </p>

<ul>
    <li>1) emitter should be as thin as possible to provide
        highest field intensity near to it to provide more charge
        carriers. </li>
    <li>2) Collector should have a form which provides _minimal_
        field intensity near surface, to prevent any ionization
        near to it resulting in "counter-current" which
        reduces the thrust. Collector should have no sharp edges
        and the best configuration is spherical or
        toroidal.&nbsp;Optimization can be made in electric-field
        simulators. </li>
    <li>3) At the other hand, it should not have too large
        surface departing from direct line between center of
        electrode and emitter, because flow&nbsp;lines deviating
        from this direct line contribute less to net thrust. From
        this point, conventional lifter configuration is best -
        because&nbsp;all surface is on the axial line.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p>But from point 2 conventional lifter could be improved to
reduce counter-current from sharp edge of its collector. </p>

<p align="center">So what is the perfect lifter from this point?
It appears to be wire-circle emitter placed co-axial with a
toroidal collector of same&nbsp; <br>
diameter. </p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="1"></a><u>Ionic jet thrust calculation</u>
(~10^-7N / 100W)&nbsp;</h2>

<p>&gt;Anyone have an idea as to the max (or practical)
efficiency of ion wind thrusters in atmosphere in terms of N/W? </p>

<p>Speed of single charged particle with mass m and charge e
accelerated between two electrodes with voltage V is: v=
sqrt(2*V*e/m).<br>
At the other hand, momentum of single particle is p=m*v =
m*sqrt(2*V*e/m) </p>

<p>To calculate number of particles flying at given power in unit
time, we divide total passed charge by the charge of single
particle </p>

<p>n=Q/(e*t)=i/e </p>

<p>current i we obtain from power E as i=E/V so n=E/(V*e) </p>

<p>Total force applyed is equal to total exchanged momentum per
unit time (assuming all momentum of accelerated particle is used
for propulsion, which is maximal possible estimate). As result we
have: </p>

<p>F=n*p=m*sqrt(2*V*e/m)*E/(e*V)&nbsp; </p>

<p>If you put there m=me=9.1093897E-31kg (electron mass) that
gives ~10^-6 N at E=100Watt, V=30 000Volt. </p>

<p>In experiment with lifter 4 they&nbsp; ( <a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lifter4.htm">http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lifter4.htm</a>
) observed thrust 0.4N at 100W, so number above is way to
small.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But if you put m=14*2=28*mp (N2) or m=16*2=32*mp (02), where
mp is mass of proton=1.6726231E-27kg, we have better picture
(10^-4N) but still way too small compared to 0.4N. Whatever ions
are used in this "ion wind", these are not ions taken
from the air... </p>

<p align="left">Mass of particle required to achieve such thrust
is&nbsp;m = F^2*V*ee/(2*E^2). </p>

<p align="left">For F=0.4N and above voltage and power we have:
m~2*10^7*mp (where mp is proton mass) or 3.69*10^-20 kg. </p>

<p align="left">This mass is not too large to be practical - it
could be clusters of the electrode material or electrode coating
brocken off the surface under very high stress applied by the
voltage. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="left"><a name="2"></a><u>Radiation pressure</u>
(~10^-9 N / 100W)</h2>

<p>&gt; 2) Poynting vector has unit of energy/second*m^2. It's
not clear how this would give a force, (Newton) </p>

<p>That is the easy one. Electromagnetic radiation has momentum,
it has been shown theoretically by Maxwell and
experimentally&nbsp;measured by Lebedev. <br>
Momentum of electromagnetic wave, p = E/c </p>

<p>To calculate the force, F = p/t = W/c.&nbsp; <br>
For radiation power W=100Watt we have force W/c ~10-9 N.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Recalculating this into "equivalent mass" we get
~10^-5 gm... too small... indeed, electrons moving with curved
trajectories and speeds around 1/3 c (like they do in
lifters)should radiate&nbsp; microwaves. There are devices called
reltrons, used to generate directed high power microwave
impulses, which have exactly same&nbsp; principle, and look very
much like lifter immerced in a vacuum tube. </p>

<p align="center">However, generated momentum of microwaves is
just too small... </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="left"><a name="2_1"></a><u>Dielectrophoresis</u></h2>

<p>Dielectrophoresis was mentioned several times here, even by me
in relation with lifter operation. </p>

<p>I have taken more close look at it as described here <a href="http://www.ibmm.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/pages/science/dep.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ibmm.informatics.bangor.ac.uk/pages/science/dep.htm</a>
<br>
and suddently realized that it can not possiblly have to do
anything with&nbsp; discussed effect. Why? - because
dielectrophoresis is a _transient_ effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
redistribution of particles in inhomogenous electric field
depending on their polarizability. Once the redistribution is
finished, material flow is also finished, therefore
dielectrophoresis is a _transient_ effect resulting in change of
material state from "Voltage OFF" to "Voltage
ON", it can not have a continuous component. </p>

<p>1) There can not be any continuous flow of electrons between
electrodes due to this effect, because there is no way how they
can pass electrode/dielectric boudary. When voltage is switched
on, there will be a transient current due to change of
capacitance due to dielectric material redistribution. When
redistribution is finished, capacitance becomes constant and
current stops. However, electric current (as well as thrust) in
lifter are observed continuously as long as voltage is on. </p>

<p>2) Correspondingly, from 1 follows that can not be any
continous flow of dielectric material, which shows that
dielectrophoresis can apply to lifters only for short moment when
voltage is switched on.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now some points not related to lifters (which are DC), but
could be relevant to AC-based propulsion devices: </p>

<p>3) When voltage is switched off, material flow is reverse to
original one and the momentum of outflowing material is same as
momentum of inflowing material therefore making net effect of one
voltage pulse equal to zero.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;This is true unless there is a difference in medium
friction coefficient at high and low flow speed, which could
result in some momentum retained by electrode arrangement. This
point needs to be investigated separately. </p>

<p>4) AC-voltage can be represented as a series of interchanging
positive and negative voltage pulses, therefore point 3) applies
to them as well. There is no net material flow except that due to
differences in friction of in/outflowing material. </p>

<p>That is why application of electrophoresis require some
additional material flow to separate more and less polarizable
particles, as they say in above cited web-site: </p>

<p align="center">"Selective separation can thus be achieved
by applying an additional force such as gravity or fluid
flow". </p>

<h2 align="left"><a name="3"></a><u>Ion/air interaction by corona
discharge in Lifter - thrust/current relation</u></h2>

<p><font size="3">In my previous messages I gave basic mechanism
of lifter operation based on corona discharge with subsequent
interraction of accelerated ions with outside enviroment. <br>
Now I am presenting the derivation of ultimate formula of
lifter&nbsp; - thrust to current relation.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Starting eqn. for force applied by electric
field to medium with distributed charge q is: <br>
F=q*E/d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">where E is voltage applied between electrodes
and d is lenght between wire and collector. This formula is
strictly correct only for plate capacitor arrangement (where ion
flight path is parallel to force) but difference due to different
field form will be small. Obviously due to first law of
mechanics, the same force is applied by medium to lifter, so this
is our force of interest. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now, lets calculate amount of charge q
distributed between electrodes at any time when corona discharge
is on. <br>
i=q*w/d&nbsp; <br>
so&nbsp; <br>
q=i*d/w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">i is current and w is drift velocity of ions
.&nbsp; Ions are moving not on straight path because electrically
induced motion is overlayed by thermal mothion. During this whole
motion ions interract with molecules of enviroment. So drift rate
is a net velocity of ions in direction from corona to collector. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now, drift velocity is related to fild strengh
as <br>
w=k*E/d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Here k is mobility coefficient of ion in air.
From the web-site of the institute of electrostatic technology
(http://fee.mpei.ac.ru/elstat/lect&nbsp; in russian) I have
values for mobility of positive ions (if wire is positive) and
negative ions (if wire negative). k (+) = 2.1
cm^2/volt*sec&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; k(-) 2.24 cm^2/volt*sec <br>
I will use k(+) for calculations below.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now bringing it all together, w from (3) into
(2) and than q from (2) into (1) we have our force: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">F=i*d*E/(w*d)&nbsp; <br>
F=i*d*E/(k*E*d/d) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Simplifying we get </font></p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="8">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><font size="3"><strong>F=i*d/k&nbsp;</strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><font size="3">Now to be totally exact we have to substract
the momentum which ions retain when they hit the collector.
F_lost = m`*w. We can easilty calculate mass flow m`=dm/dt
knowing current and molecular weight of ions, which is
M=19gm/mole.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">m` = M*i/(e*Na) <br>
Na is Avogadro number = 6.0221367E+23 mole^-1, e - electron
charge = 1.6*10^-19 <br>
so (substituting w from (3)) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">F_lost = M*i*k*E/(d*e*Na) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">F_total =&nbsp; F-F_lost </font></p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="8">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><font size="3"><strong>F_total=i*d/k&nbsp; -
        M*i*k*E/(d*e*Na) </strong></font></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><font size="3">Wow! while current certainly depends on
voltage, the result is that at given current thrust does not
depend on voltage. At given current thrust increases with lenght
between electrodes. <br>
Later we will see that F_lost is negligibly small, so good
equation to work with is simply&nbsp; i*d/k </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now the ultimate test - I compare the predicton
of this equation with real experimentally observed thrust for
lifters 1-4 (data on current, config and experimentaly observed
thrust from table in </font><a href="http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lifter4.htm"><font size="3">http://jnaudin.free.fr/html/lifter4.htm</font></a><font size="3"> ). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">First <strong><u>Lifter1</u></strong>: <br>
d= 30mm <br>
k=k (+) = 2.1 cm^2/volt*sec <br>
i=450uA </font></p>

<p><font size="3">F1=0.064 N <br>
F_lost = 1.8*10^-7N (so will be neglected in all other
calculations) <br>
experimental F1exp=2.3+1gm*g =0.032N </font></p>

<p><font size="3">WOW! the prediction and experiment differ only
2 times!&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Remember that we considered the straight fligh
path of ions, but actually it is curved so in reality less force
is applied because not all force is directed parallely to
wire/collector line. Additional power loss can happen due to
"counter-current" of ions with opposite sign because of
small corona formation at collector (if edge is too sharp) <br>
More exact calculation considering exact field configuration
might come even closer, but hey - we have our raw equation! Du
you think numbers are so close just by chance!? </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Anyway, lets see other lifters.&nbsp; <br>
<strong><u>Lifter2</u></strong><strong> </strong>: <br>
d = 30mm <br>
i=570uA <br>
<strong>F2=0.077 N <br>
F2exp=6.6+3gm*g=0.094N </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong><u>Lifter v3.0</u></strong><strong> </strong>:
<br>
d=30mm <br>
i=2.46mA <br>
<strong>F3=0.351 N <br>
F3exp=16+4gm*g= 0.196 N </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong><u>Lifter 4.0</u></strong><strong> </strong>:
<br>
d=40mm <br>
i=2.01mA <br>
<strong>F4=0.383 N <br>
F4exp=32+4gm*g=0.353 N </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Wow! This is realy close. Note that lifter 4
used rounded-up top of collector to minimize counter-current, so
it achieved higher lift efficiency vs. theoretical equation
compared to other lifters. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">To summarize - Prediction falls quite near to
experimental results for all sizes of lifter, and the closes
result is in case where minimal counter-current can be expected.
Finaly you have an equation to judge lifter efficiency, and
additional proof for ion-propulsion mechanism.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">Later I will investigate
relation between voltage and current.&nbsp; Anway, the main point
in improvement of lifter's force/power ratio - how to increase
the current and distance between wire and collector without
increasing voltage.&nbsp; </font></p>

<hr>

<h2 align="left"><a name="4"></a><u>Thrust/voltage relation in
lifter</u></h2>

<p>This calculation is based on assumptions&nbsp; that corona is
present only on one electrode so the counter-current of ions with
opposite to wire sign is negligible. Otherwise counter-current
would reduce thrust. </p>

<p>The corona onset voltage V0 is given by Peek's equation (links
to some chapters of Peek's book are in <a href="http://www.ee.vill.edu/ion/p61.html" target="_blank">http://www.ee.vill.edu/ion/p61.html</a>
): </p>

<p>V0=g0*r*ln(d/r) <br>
where <br>
g0=30*kV/cm*delta*(1+0.301/sqrt(delat*r)) </p>

<p>where r is radius of corona-wire in cm, d distance between
wires and&nbsp; <br>
delta is a factor depending on air pressure and temperature as <br>
delta=3.92b/(273+t ) <br>
where b is pressure in cm of barometric pressure and <br>
t is temperature in degree C. </p>

<p>At d=30mm&nbsp; and r=0.5 mm&nbsp; we get V0=14.4 kV </p>

<p>Anyway, in my derivation the field strengh E has canceled out
because it at one side it increases thrust, and the other side
decreases it by decresing number of carriers (charge) inside the
interval. So there is no voltage in the equation, only current. </p>

<p>If we want voltage/thrust dependence, it also can be
done.&nbsp; <br>
The current/voltage characteristic of flat collector / wire
combination&nbsp; <br>
is derived by Copperman (see <a href="http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me5115/notes/ESPnotes.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me5115/notes/ESPnotes.pdf</a>
<br>
for details).&nbsp; </p>

<p>It has general form: </p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="8">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><strong>I =
        k*G*V(V-V0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        eqn. 1 </strong></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>where k ion mobility coeficient and V voltage and&nbsp; G
depends on particular electrode configuration. </p>

<p>For the case of wire/parallel flat plate electrode
configuration <br>
G = 2*pi*e0*L/(d^2*ln(f_geo/r)) </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
e0 - dielectric permittivity of air <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
r is the wire radius; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d is the wire-plate spacing; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
W plate width <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
L&nbsp; plate lenght (should be &gt;&gt; W)&nbsp; <br>
f_geo is the characteristic length of particular electrode
geompetry&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f_geo=4d/pi for
2*d/W&lt;= 0.6, and&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
f_geo=(W/2)*pi exp(pi*d/W)&nbsp;&nbsp; for 2*d/W&gt;=2.0&nbsp; <br>
First is more near to lifter case, but maybe second case with
some effective W can also be used. </p>

<p>Unfortunately wire/paralel plate approximation is not very
good for Lifter. <br>
For example for Lifter 1 at 40kV and d=30mm we get&nbsp; <br>
with f_geo(1) and r (30 gauge)=0.1275 mm <br>
I= 1.8mA whereas experiment shows 450uA. </p>

<p>If we use f_geo (2) it is not clear what to put as plate witdh
W. Intuitivelly it should be less that foil hight h=40mm (because
foil is not parallel to wire) but much more then thickness of the
foil. I found that using empyrical "effective width"
h/7 gives current <br>
I=480 uA which is near to experimental so eqn. can be used in
this form. </p>

<p>Anyway, derivation of strict eqn. for G for lifter electrode
configuration is still open. </p>

<p>So what about thrust? From above eqn and using my previous
eqn. for thrust F=i*d/k <br>
we have <a name="eqn">voltage/thrust relation</a>: </p>

<table border="2" cellpadding="8">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><strong>F=2*pi*e0*L*V(V-V0)/(d*ln(f_geo/
r)))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        eqn.2 </strong></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Remarkalbe thing is that k canceled out and that d went into
denominator which <br>
indicates that it should be kept as small as possible because it
decreases current as d^2 but increases thrust only as d^1. </p>

<p>Using f_geo (2) with W=h/6 we get for Lifter 1 where&nbsp; <br>
L=200*3=600mm <br>
V=40kV <br>
r= (assuming 50 gauge = 0.255 mm diameter) = 0.1275 mm </p>

<p>F=0.069 N&nbsp; which is about twice of experimentally
observed 0.032 N probably due to some counter-current. Anyway it
is not bad for a raw assesment and considering that
counter-current should reduce the thrust. </p>

<p>Let's see what we would get using 50 gauge wire as Tom Ventura
recently&nbsp; <br>
tried (quite a cool experiment considering how brittle it should
be) <br>
r= (30 gauge = 0.025 mm diameter) = 0.01275 <br>
I obtain using eqn. 1 <br>
i= 51 uA <br>
F=0.072 N at 40kV </p>

<p>So with decreasing wire thickness we get thrust increase of
4.3%. </p>

<p align="center">I will explore later how to optimize
power/thrust relation based on this eqn., and to find form of G
which corresponds exactly to lifter electrode configuration. </p>

<h2><a name="6"></a><u>AC operation of Lifter</u></h2>

<p>&gt; I am thinking: since many experiments have shown that
reverse polarity still produce lift force (which kI found out was
true with my lifter) then perhaps AC will work as well?&nbsp; </p>

<p>It will depend on frequency you are using. You have to provide
that ions which "started" from corona wire reach the
collector before&nbsp;you change the polarity. Otherwise you will
have in wire/collector interval mix of positive and negative ions
flying back and forth&nbsp;and compensating each others
thrust.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is easy to calculate maximal frequency below which you will
still have thrust (critical frequency). It will be 1/tau <br>
where tau is flight time of ion between electrodes. </p>

<p>tau = d/w&nbsp; <br>
where w is drift velocity and d is distance between electrodes </p>

<p>w = k*E/d where E is voltage and k mobility coefficient
(about&nbsp;2.1 cm^2/volt*sec). So critical frequency is </p>

<p>f=1/tau = k*E/d^2 </p>

<p>for E=40 kV and d=30mm <br>
we have <br>
f_crit=9.3*10^3 Hz (about 10kHz) </p>

<p>In you increase AC frequency Above value thrust
will&nbsp;rapidly decrease. If you operate at much lower frequcy
you will have thrust, but I guess it will be less than tha DC
value at the same voltage. </p>

<h2><a name="6"></a><u>3-electrode&nbsp; AC/DC lifter proposal</u></h2>

<p>Any theory is good only if it allows to improve some
technolgoy.&nbsp; <br>
Equation F=i*d/k suggests, that it is desirable to maximaze
amount of available charge (and corespondingly
current)&nbsp;without increasing d or V.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For this we need to de-couple charge generation from
ion-aceleration. This could be achieved by&nbsp; simple
3-electrode AC-DC lifter design. Instead of&nbsp;corona wire we
use two winded together wires, one of which is insulated with
sufficiently thick teflon insulation (lets call&nbsp;it
"base"). We apply between this 2 electrodes AC voltage
sufficient&nbsp;to produce sustained barrier discharge. Because
of very small&nbsp;distance between electrodes required AC
voltage would be quite small,&nbsp;say 5 kV. It can be further
reduced by coating the insulation with&nbsp;ferroelectric
material pelets but for preliminary test it is
not&nbsp;necessary. </p>

<p>Now, as we already have our plasma, we only need to
"suck" out of it ions of one polarity. For this we
place with distance d (much larger than usual, say 100 mm, a
collector and apply DC voltage between it and not-insulated wire,
"emmiter" (which should be +). This way we&nbsp;should
achieve noticeable current betwen emmiter and collector
at&nbsp;quite large distances d but reasonably small DC and AC
voltages&nbsp;applied and those get much higher F=i*d/k at lower
power. Is this a&nbsp;way to radically improve thrust/power ratio
and escape from the&nbsp;need of magic lifter electrode
confuguration and very high voltages&nbsp;needed for initiation
of corona? Some cool experimentator is required&nbsp;to answer
this question... &nbsp; </p>
