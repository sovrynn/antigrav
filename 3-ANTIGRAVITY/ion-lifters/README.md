# Ion lifters

I come across this phrase often (ion wind, ion propulsion), but don't really understand how it works.

Ionocraft, high voltage lifter, ion propulsion, lifter, it has many names.

Apparently this technique is used in spacecraft thrusters, used in orbit/space for propulsion.

My opinion is that it does not involve ion wind at all, but rather, the same force that allows the graviflyer to fly.

# Parameters to increase efficiency (research paper)

It seems that the direction of the polarities produces only a minor difference in the power, and that what is much more important is the asymmetricity of the lifter.

Additionally, when the objects are placed closer together, the effect is stronger.

In addition, adding extra wires to the top reduces the effect, whereas adding more material to the bottom strengthens the effect.

Finally, you want to make the wire as thin as possible.

FINALLY you can see that there is a threshold power below which the setup produces 0 thrust. Which would indicate that there is no ether flow induced between the oppositely charged charges, if I had to guess, or its so small (and increasing exponentially) that it only starts to "appear" on the scale at a certain point, much like bitcoin on a linear chart

## required voltage for lift

You see that you only get lift of 1.72 g at about 20 kV (potential difference), in the research paper.

The graviflyer could easily be a lb, which is close to a kg. Probably you're getting about 100x to 1000x efficiency increase versus the ion lifter.

## Questions

Now, I wonder if this setup would work if the charges were the same polarity.

# Basic principles

The key principle is the differently shaped electric fields of different polarity.

## Reversing polarity?

Apparently these work even if the polarity is reversed, but not as well. That's telling - very telling.

## Smoke flow

It appears that while the ion lifter goes up, the smoke goes down. Which is very, very interesting.

My hypothesis is that in the basic triangle ion lifters, tiny upwards whirlpools are created from the negative thick (bottom) to the positive thin (top). Thus, this then creates a downward draft in the center and immediately around the lifter.

When you counterrotate the top and bottom, this whirlpool becomes large enough that it eliminates a central downward draft, and the downward flow then occurs around the entire craft.

If you watch how the lifter is deformed when flying, and then relaxing when it falls, this can give you a clue as to what is happening.

It's definitely not ion wind.

# Spacecraft Ion Engines / Thrusters

Apparently ion thrusters generate very little absolute thrust - on the order of millinewtons to a few hundred millinewtons, equivalent to the weight of a piece of paper.
