        <b>Viktor S. Grebennikov</b> died in the spring of 2001. The
        eternal memory of this uncommon scientist-naturalist will remain
        in our hearts. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction by Juri N. Cherednichenko</b> (Laboratory of
        biophysics Scientific Research Institute of General Pathology
        and Human Ecology SB Russian Ac. Med. Sci. Novosibirsk-city): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor S. Grebennikov is the
        scientist-naturalist, professional entomologist, gifted painter
        and, on the whole, comprehensively well-educated specialist with
        a wide spectrum of interests. For many people and scientists in
        Russia he is well-known as discoverer of cavity structural
        effect (CSE). But is far from being all are acquainted with his
        other opening, also borrowed from among concealed secrets of
        alive Nature. In 1988 he found out antigravitational effects of
        chitinous covers some insects species. But the most astonishing
        attendant phenomenon associated with antigravity was a
        phenomenon overall either partial invisibility or deformed
        visual perception of the material object which was located in a
        zone of compensated gravitation. Based on this opening and by
        using bionics principles, the author designed and builded
        antigravitational platform, and also, practically, developed
        principles manned flight with the speed up to 25 km/min. Since
        1991-92 years the device was used by the author as a means of
        fast movement. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's well known wide spectrum of the natural
        phenomenology biogravitational effects, apparently, appropriate
        not only some species of insects. For example, it's numerous
        experimentally controlled cases of the material objects weight
        decrease under directed human psychokinetic influence, yogi's
        levitation in the states of deep transcendental Maharishi's
        meditation, mediums levitation or even disappearance in some
        rare spiritualistic communication sessions etc. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But would be by a mistake to think, that
        similar opportunities granted only to naturally gifted people.
        On my belief it's general biological law which insufficiently
        investigated. As is known, in somnambulistic (sleep-walking)
        condition, weight of the man is considerably reduced. So,
        somnambulist, which have body weight up to 80 - 90 kg in normal,
        during the night travels can pass over thin wooden bar; to tread
        upon the man, laying in neighbour bed, which haven't feeling
        physical pressure (except for a fright). Some clinical cases of
        genuine epilepsy during small attack (petit mal) someone have
        result in short-term convertible personality transformation
        (which sometimes in the people named as possessed by evil
        spirit), when slender girl, exhausted by illness, or 10 years
        old boy get physical ability like trained athlete. Now this
        psychophysiological phenomenon was named multiple personality,
        since it considerably differs from classical variants epileptic
        syndrome. Such clinical cases are well known and are wide
        described in literature. However, the phenomena accompanying
        man's or material objects weight changing not always take a
        place in pathological conditions. The healthy people in
        conditions of acute emotional stress, connected with threat to
        life or dominant motivation of urgency achievement any vital
        purpose, are capable involuntarily to overcome obstacles,
        insuperable in a usual condition; to lift huge weights etc.
        Usually it try to explain by extreme mobilization muscular
        forces, though the exact calculation will not be correlated to
        the similar assumptions. Apparently, the biogravitational
        mechanisms are especially advanced in the sportsmen (high
        jumpers, weight-lifters, sprinters and long-distance runners).
        The productivity of their sports achievement in many respects
        (if not basically) is determined by psychological training, but
        not so much depend on physical status. If the correct scientific
        research problem of the human weight anomalies in various
        psychophysiological states was put and the equipment of dynamic
        monitoring of weight was created, we have received the quite
        objective information on this unusual phenomenon. The phenomena,
        short-term increase of weight of biological objects (including
        the men), which have been not connected with mass carry are
        known also. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V.Grebennikov's book is written in highly
        artistic style and was illustrated by author himself. It content
        is peculiar "dactylogram" of spiritual wealth system, ecological
        ideology and author's entomological autobiography. Certainly, by
        many readers the book will be perceived, no more than popular
        general conclusion of 60-year's experience of specialist in the
        field of insects's world secrets, embellished by elements of a
        science fiction. But this is deep mistake. Being well familiar
        with V.Grebennikov and his works not by hearsay (and we live no
        more than in 10 kms from each other), I can tell, that I did not
        see more scientific diligent and truthful researcher and
        talented, qualified experimenter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, V.Grebennikov and his pioneer
        works are well-known advantageously in so-called Russian
        scientific "underground" environment. But the opening of such
        scale, on my deep belief, should not be buried in the
        manuscripts, only because a scientific pragmatism not for a
        while yet is at authority. So be it that this popular scientific
        book will be for this so called "scientists" "science fiction".
        At everyone his faith, but just one trouble if his faith is
        blind. But, having eyes, will see. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viktor Stepanovich Grebennikov ---
        naturalist and a professional entomologist. He is also an artist
        and an intellectual with a wide range of interests and pursuits.
        He is known to many as the discoverer of the Cavity Structures
        Effect (CSE). But very few people are familiar with his other
        discovery, the one that also borrows from Nature and its
        innermost secrets. He has discovered antigravitational effects
        of the chitin shell of certain insects back in 1988 but, the
        most impressive concomitant phenomenon he has discovered at the
        same time was that of complete or partial invisibility and/or of
        distorted perception of material objects entering the zone of
        compensated gravity. Based on this discovery, Victor Grebennikov
        used bionic principles to design and build an anti-gravitational
        platform for hovering flights at the speeds of up to 25 km/min.
        Since 1991-92 he has used this device for his own fast
        transportation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bio-gravitational effects are a wide
        spectrum of natural phenomena, apparently not confined to just a
        few species of insects. There is much empirical data to support
        the possibility of a lowered weight or complete levitation of
        material objects as a result of directed psycho-physical human
        action (psychokinesis) e. g. levitation of yogi practicing
        transcendental meditation according to the Maharishi method.
        There are known cases of mediums levitating during spiritistic
        sessions. However, it would be a mistake to think that such
        abilities are only found in people who are gifted by nature. I
        am convinced that these abilities are an understudied biological
        regularity. As is known, human weight significantly drops in the
        state of somnambulistic automatism (sleepwalking). Average 80-90
        kg sleepwalkers are able to tread on thin planks, or step on
        people sleeping next to them without causing the latter any
        physical discomfort other than fright during their nocturnal
        journeys. Some clinical cases of non-spasmodic epileptic fits
        often result in a short-term reversible transformation of
        personality (people in such state are commonly referred to as
        "possessed"), whereby a skinny, exhausted girl or a ten year old
        boy may acquire the physical prowess of a trained athlete. This
        psychological phenomenon is currently known as the multiple
        personality syndrome, because it significantly differs from the
        classical complex of epileptic symptoms. Such clinical cases are
        well known and well documented. However, phenomena accompanied
        by a change in the weight of humans or of material objects are
        not confined to functional pathologies of the organism. Healthy
        people in the state of acute psychological stress caused by a
        life threatening situation or an overpowering motivation to
        achieve a vitally important goal have the ability to
        spontaneously overcome obstacles insurmountable in their normal
        condition. People in such situations are able to lift enormous
        weights etc. These phenomena are commonly explained by an
        extreme mobilization of muscular strength, but precise
        calculations do not agree with such hypotheses. Apparently,
        athletes (high jumpers, weightlifters, runners) have
        particularly developed bio-antigravitational mechanisms. Their
        athletic performance is mostly (if not wholly) determined not so
        much by the rigor of their training as by their psychological
        preparedness. If an accurate scientific task of studying the
        anomalies of the human weight in various psycho physiological
        states were ever set up and a technical means of dynamic weight
        monitoring created, we would then have objective data on this
        unusual phenomenon. There is also evidence of other phenomena of
        short-term mass increase in biological objects, including
        humans, that are not related to mass transfer. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V. S. Grebennikov's book has high literary
        merit and includes the author's own illustrations. It is a kind
        of a "fingerprint" for his system of spiritual values, his
        environmental outlook, and his entomological autobiography. Many
        readers are likely to perceive the book as nothing more than a
        popularized summary of the entomologist's 60 year experience of
        scientific observations, peppered with some elements of science
        fiction. But, such a conclusion would be deeply erroneous. As
        Viktor Stepanovich's friend and as someone with an intimate
        knowledge of his work (our homes are only 10 km apart), I can
        vouch that I have never met a more careful, conscientious,
        honest, and talented experimental scientist. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V. Grebennikov is also widely known in the
        so-called scientific underground, which is the branch of
        advanced Russian science constantly persecuted by the official
        scientific establishment. An establishment committee for
        combating of "pseudo science", created in Novosibirsk division
        of the Russian Academy, has victimized many talented members of
        our local scientific community. The situation is much the same
        at the Russian Agricultural Academy. It is very easy to lose
        one's job at a lab, even as its head, regardless of one's degree
        and title. One only needs to publish an article on, for example,
        the evolutionary significance of anti gravitational mechanisms
        in insects. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I am convinced that discoveries of such
        proportions must not be buried in manuscripts just because
        pragmatism still rules science. Let this book be nothing but
        "science fiction" for those at the top. Each person has his own
        beliefs but, he who has eyes shall see. Catastrophism in both,
        the evolution of living nature and in the nature of human
        knowledge, is actually a drastic destruction of old belief
        systems, a destruction that runs ahead of theoretical
        prognostications. A fanatical faith and worship of idols links
        our contemporary academic science with pagan religion. Yet, a
        harmonious development (in the sense of Pavel Florensky's
        pneumatosphere) would not be possible without breaking of the
        old stereotypes in the process of mastering the wisdom and
        experience of older generations. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a quiet evening in the steppe. The red
        disk of the sun has already touched the faraway, misty horizon.
        It's too late to get back home. I've stayed too long here among
        my insects and I am getting ready to spend the night in the
        open. Thank goodness, I still have some water in the field
        bottle. I also have some mosquito repellent left and one really
        needs it here, with the hosts of gnats on the steep shores of
        this salty lake. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am in the steppes of Kamyshlovo valley.
        The valley used to carry a mighty tributary of the Irtysh river,
        but the plowing of the steppes and the deforestation of the
        hills has turned the river into a deep, broad gully speckled by
        a string of salty lakes like this one. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evening is quiet and calm tonight. Pods
        of ducks gleam over the evening lake and I can hear sandpipers
        in the distance. The high, pearly sky stretches over the
        soothing world of the steppe. Oh, how good it is to be out here,
        in the open country! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am ready to settle for the night on the
        very edge of the steppe on the grassy glade above the gully.
        I've spread out my coat on the ground and set the backpack down
        as my pillow, collected few dry cakes of cow manure and lit them
        up before lying down. The romantic, unforgettable smell of
        bluish smoke is slowly spreading across the dozing plane. I lie
        down on my simple bed, stretch my tired legs and anticipate yet
        another wonderful night in the open country. The blue smoke will
        take me quietly into the land of fairy tales as the night's
        drowsiness is overcoming me quite fast. I shrink to a very small
        size of an ant, then I grow enormous, the size of the whole sky
        and I am about to fall asleep. But why is it that these "pre
        sleep transformations" of my bodily dimensions are somewhat
        unusual today, so strong? A new sensation has mixed in, a
        sensation of falling as though the high cliff above the gully
        has been snatched away from under me and I were falling into an
        unknown, terrible abyss! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, I see flashes in front of my eyes
        and I open them but, the flashes would not disappear. They keep
        dancing on the pearly silver evening sky above and on the grass
        around me. I can feel a strong metallic taste in my mouth, as
        though I have pressed my tongue to the contact plates of a small
        electric battery. My ears have started ringing and I can
        distinctly hear the double beats of my own heart. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can one sleep when such things are going
        on! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit up and try to drive away these
        unpleasant sensations but, nothing comes out of my efforts. The
        only result is that the flashes are no longer wide and blurred
        but, they became sharp and clear now, like sparks or perhaps
        small arcs and they make it difficult for me to look around. Now
        I remember. I had a very similar experience a few years ago in
        Lesochek [Little Grove], or to be more precise in the Enchanted
        Grove [the author is referring to localities of an entomological
        preserve in Omsk Region]. I have to get up and go for a walk
        around the lake shore. Does it feel like this everywhere around
        here? No. I feel a clear effect of "something" only right here,
        a meter from the edge of the cliff, while the effect clearly
        disappears ten meters further into the steppe. It gets a bit
        frightening. I am alone in the deserted countryside, by the
        "Enchanted Lake". I should pack up quickly and clear out but, my
        curiosity takes over me. What is this, really? Could it be that
        the smell of the salty lake water and the rotting slime would do
        this to me? I slid down down the cliff side under the steppe and
        sit down by the edge of the water. The thick, sweetish smell of
        sapropel and the rotting remains of algae has enveloped me like
        the mud in a spa. I sit there for five, may be ten minutes with
        no unpleasant sensations. It would be much better to sleep here,
        only if it weren't so damp. I climb back up onto the plane of
        the steppe and the same old story repeats! My head begins to
        spin and I get that galvanic, sour taste in my mouth again and I
        feel as though my weight were constantly changing. I feel
        incredibly light at one moment and unbearably heavy the next and
        the same streaks of light flash in my eyes as before. If this
        were indeed a "bad spot", some nasty anomaly, then no grass
        would grow here and the large bees would not be nesting just
        below in the loamy edge of the cliff. Yet, their nests are all
        over the place and in fact, I had made my bed right above their
        underground "bee cities", with their multitude of tunnels and
        chambers whose depths harbor so many larvae and cocoons, all of
        them alive and thriving. Albeit, I understood nothing at this
        time and I got up from my unpleasant bed with a headache long
        before the sunrise and hobbled off, all tired, toward the road
        to catch a hitch to Isilkul. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have visited the "Enchanted Lake" four
        more times that summer at various times of the day and under
        various weather conditions. My bees got incredibly busy toward
        the end of the summer stuffing their holes with pollen of the
        wild flowers and apparently feeling excellent. That was not my
        case though, while standing about a meter off the cliff edge
        above their nests. The set of the most unpleasant sensations
        would again settle in me, right here, while there would be none
        some five meters away and I feel the same old bewilderment: Why?
        Why do these bees feel so good here, feel so great that the
        entire cliff is drilled with their holes like a Swiss cheese and
        in places looking almost like a sponge? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution to this has come to me many
        years later, when the bee city in Kamyshlovo Valley has long
        since disappeared. The tillage reached the very edge of the
        cliff. Its top has consequently dropped off and what used to be
        a hard earthen bank with its bee nests and grassy top has turned
        into an atrocious and ugly, muddy slide. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Victor%20S.%20Grebennikov_%20Insect%20Chitin%20Anti-Gravity%20&amp;%20Cavity%20Structural%20Effect%20(CSE)_files/5s.jpg" width="245" height="157"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I had a handful of old clay lumps, the
        fragments of the nests with their multiple chamber cells, back
        at my home. Their side by side cells reminded me of small
        thimbles, or little jugs with narrowing necks. I already knew
        that these bees were of the quadruple ring species, with 4 light
        rings on their elongated bellies. I had a wide container filled
        with these spongy clay lumps on my equipment cluttered desk,
        along with ant and grasshopper houses, bottles with chemicals
        and other assorted interesting stuff. I was about to pick
        something or another up and I moved my hand above these porous
        fragments. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A miracle! I had suddenly felt the warmth
        emanating from these remains. I've touched the lumps with my
        bare hand yet, they were cold. But, I could clearly feel the
        thermal sensation right above them. I could also feel some
        hitherto unknown jerks, some sort of "tick" in my fingers,
        besides the warmth. When I pushed the jar with the nests to the
        end of the desk and leaned over it, I had felt the same
        sensation in my head, the feeling, which has overwhelmed me by
        the lake. I felt again as if I were getting lighter and bigger,
        with the vertigo of my body falling down. I saw the same rapid
        flashes of light in my eyes and my mouth had the electric

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed a sheet of cardboard over the jar,
        but the sensation wouldn't change. A have covered the jar with
        metallic pot lid but, it changed nothing either. It looked as if
        "something" was acting right through it. I was compelled to
        study the phenomenon at once but, what could I do at home,
        without any necessary physical instruments? The help came from
        many research scientists of various institutes of the
        Agricultural Academy in Novosibirsk. But alas, the instruments
        like thermometers, ultrasound detectors, magnetometers and
        electrometers did not respond to the nests in the slightest. We
        have conducted a precise chemical analysis of the clay and found
        nothing special. The radiometer was also silent, yet the
        ordinary human hands, and not only mine, would distinctly feel
        either warmth or cold, or a tingle, or sometimes a thicker,
        stickier environment. Some people's hands felt heavier, others
        felt lighter as if pushed up. Some people's fingers and arm
        muscles got numb, some felt giddy and developed profuse
        salivation. I could observe a similar phenomenon in a bunch of
        paper tubes inhabited by leaf cutting bees. Each tunnel had a
        solid row of multi-layered "cans" made from torn leaves, covered
        with concave lids (also made from leaves). These cans contained
        silk, oval cocoons with larvae and chrysalides. I asked
        unsuspecting people who knew nothing of my discovery to hold
        their hands or faces over the leaf cutter nests and have made a
        detailed record of their replies in this experiment. Its results
        may be found in my article "On the physical and biological
        properties of pollinator bee nests" published in the Siberian
        Bulletin of Agricultural Science, no.3, 1984. The same article
        contains the formula of my discovery, a brief physical
        description of this wonderful phenomenon. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have created a few dozen artificial
        honeycombs from plastic, paper, metal and wood, based on the
        structures of bee nests. It turned out that the cause of all
        those unusual sensations was not a biological field, but the
        size, shape, quantity and arrangement of cavities formed by and
        in any solid object. And as before, the organism felt it, while
        the instruments remained silent. I called the discovery the
        Cavity Structures Effect (CSE) and I have carried on with my
        experiments. Nature has continued to reveal to me its innermost
        secrets one after another. It has turned out that the CSE zone
        inhibits the growth of saprophytic soil bacteria, inhibits the
        growth of yeast and other similar cultures as well as it
        inhibits wheat grain germination. The behavior of microscopic
        agile chlamydospores also changes in this effective zone. Leaf
        cutting bee larvae begin to phosphoresce, while adult bees are
        much more active in this field and finish pollination two weeks
        earlier than they would otherwise. It has turned out that this
        CSE, same as gravitation, can't be shielded. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It affects living organisms through walls,
        thick metal and any other screens. It has turned out that if a
        porous object were moved, a person would not feel the change in
        CSE location immediately but, a few seconds or minutes later.
        While the old location would retain a "trace", or as I called it
        a "phantom" of the CSE field perceivable by the hand for hours
        and sometimes for months thereafter. It has turned out that the
        CSE field did not decrease evenly with distance but, surrounded
        the honeycomb with a system of invisible, yet sometimes clearly
        perceivable "shells". It has turned out that animals (white
        mice) and humans entering the zone of the CSE field (even a very
        strong one) would soon adapt to it. It couldn't be otherwise. We
        are surrounded everywhere by cavities, large and small,
        surrounded by grids and cells of living and dead plants (as well
        as our own cells). We are surrounded by bubbles of foam rubber,
        foam plastic, foam concrete, rooms, corridors, halls, roofing,
        spaces between machine parts, trees, furniture and buildings. It
        has turned out that the CSE "ray" had a stronger impact on
        living organisms when it was directed away from the sun and also
        downwards, facing the Earth center. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has turned out that clocks, both
        mechanical and electronic, run inaccurately when placed in a
        strong CSE field. The CSE seems to have an effect on time too.
        All this is a manifestation of the will of the matter,
        constantly moving and transforming and existing eternally. It
        has turned out that the French physicist Louis de Broglie was
        awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of these waves back in
        the 20s and that the latter were used in electronic microscopes.
        My research has gone well. Many other things transpired from my
        experiments and study, but they would lead us into solid-state
        physics, quantum mechanics, elementary particle physics and
        generally very far away from the main characters of our
        narrative, the insects. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have managed to devise instruments for an
        objective registration of the CSE, which react accurately to the
        proximity of insect nests during all this time. Here they are in
        the drawings. They are the sealed vessels with straws and burnt
        twigs and drawing charcoals suspended on spider web threads in
        them, with some water on the bottom countering the effects of
        static electricity, which hinders such experiments in dry air.
        If you point an old wasp nest, a bee honeycomb or a bunch of
        cereal ears at the upper end of the indicator, it turns slowly a
        few dozen degrees around. This is no miracle. The energy of
        scintillating electrons of both multi-cavity bodies creates a
        total wave system in space, whereby this wave is energy capable
        of causing the mutual repulsion of these objects even through
        such obstacles as a the thick walled steel capsule in the photo.
        It is hard to imagine that the armor of this capsule isn't
        capable to stop waves from a tiny, light wasp nest seen in the
        picture and that the indicator inside this heavy, solid capsule
        turns away from this long vacant nest, sometimes as much as 180
        degrees. Yet it is so. Those who have doubts are welcome to
        visit the Agroecology Museum near Novosibirsk and see it all for
        themselves. </p>

            Grebennikov's Russian Patent # 2061509</a> --- PDF ]</b>. It
        consists of a chair with an overhead cap, which contains a few
        empty but, intact honeybee combs ("dry" honeycombs, in the
        beekeeper's vocabulary). Anyone who sits in this chair will
        almost certainly feel something (please write to me what exactly
        you feel, I'll be grateful) after a few minutes, while those
        with a headache will say good bye to the pain shortly, at least
        for a few hours. My painkillers are successfully used in many
        parts of the country now, because I have made no secret from my
        discovery. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your hand will clearly sense the CSE
        emanation, if you place it from below and palm up against the
        cap with bee honeycombs. The cap could be made from cardboard or
        veneer, or better still from tin plate with tightly sealed
        seams. This is painkiller is yet another gift from the world of
        insects. My reasoning behind this invention was that people have
        been dealing with the honeybees for thousands of years and no
        one has ever complained about anything unpleasant related to
        them except, of course, for their stings. I've tried to hold a
        dry honeycomb over my head and it worked! I have decided to use
        a set of six frames. This is the story of my rather simple
        discovery. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old wasp nest works quite differently,
        even though the size and shape of its cells is very close to
        those of the honey bees. The important difference between the
        two is that the wasp honeycomb material, unlike that of honey
        bee wax, is more crumbly and micro porous. It is paper like. (By
        the way, it's wasps, who invented paper, rather than people.
        Wasps scrape old wood fiber, mix it with their sticky saliva and
        let it dry out.) Walls of the wasp honeycomb are much thinner
        than those of bees and their cell size and pattern is also
        different. The nest itself is like a multi-layered, loosely
        wrapped paper outer shell. I've had reports of highly unpleasant
        effects of a few wasp nests in an attic. Besides that, most
        multiple cell devices and objects with a manifested CSE field
        have a far from beneficial effect on humans in the first few
        minutes. Honey bee combs are a rare exception. I have often
        observed the bumblebees living in our Isilkul flat in the 1960s.
        A young bumble bee did not take the trouble to remember the
        entrance to the hive and it would spend hours wandering around
        the windows of our house and of a similar looking house nearby
        on its first trip out of the hive. It would give up on its poor
        visual memory in the evening and it would land on the brick wall
        precisely outside the hive and it would try to break right
        through the wall. Now, how did the insect know that its home
        nest was right there, four meters away from the entrance to the
        attic and a meter and a half below, behind the thick, half meter
        wall? I was lost at the time in conjectures but now I know
        exactly why the bumble bee behaved in that manner. It is an
        amazing find, wouldn't you agree? Now let us remember the
        experiment in which hunter wasps returned not only to a given
        location but, even to an entirely different location to where
        the lump of soil with their nest had been moved. I do not doubt
        that they were able to find it because of the wave emitter
        created by their nest cavities. </p>

        <p><img src="Victor%20S.%20Grebennikov_%20Insect%20Chitin%20Anti-Gravity%20&amp;%20Cavity%20Structural%20Effect%20(CSE)_files/9s.jpg" width="154" height="189"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was yet another mystery to be revealed
        to me by my insect friends. It has turned out that flowers also
        use similar powerful and unstoppable wave emitter besides their
        color, odor and nectar in order to attract their pollinators. I
        have discovered it with a drawing charcoal, a burnt twig by
        passing it over large, bell shaped flowers (tulips, lilies,
        amaryllises, mallows or pumpkins). I could feel "braking" of
        this detector already at quite a distance from the flower. I
        have learned to find a flower in a dark room standing one or two
        meters away from it with this detector but, only if it had not
        been moved. If it were moved, i would detect a "false target",
        the "ghost" field left in its old location, the residual
        "phantom" I have already mentioned. I do not possess any super
        sensory abilities, and any person would be able to do the same
        after some training. One could use a 10 cm long piece of a
        yellow sorghum stem instead of a charcoal rod, or a short pencil
        whose rear end should be facing the flower. Some people would be
        able to feel the flower (a "warm", "cold", or "shivering"
        sensation emanating from it) with their bare hands, tongues, or
        even faces. As many experiments demonstrated, children and
        adolescents are particularly sensitive to these waves of matter.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the bees, which nest
        underground, their "knowledge" of the CSE is vital to them.
        First of all, it enables the builder of a new gallery to stay
        away from the neighboring nests. Otherwise, the entire bee city
        all cut through with intersecting holes would simply collapse.
        Secondly, plant roots cannot be allowed to grow down into the
        galleries and honeycombs and indeed the roots stop growing any
        further a few centimeters away from the honeycomb of tunnels and
        chambers and start growing aside, feeling that nests are near. </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have confirmed the latter conclusion by my
        many experiments on couching wheat seeds in a strong CSE field,
        as compared to the seeds germinating in the same climatic
        conditions but in the absence of the CSE field. Photographs and
        drawings show both, the dying of roots in the experimental batch
        as well as their sharp deviation in a direction away from my
        artificial honeycomb. Therefore, the bees and the weeds back at
        the lake had made a pact long ago and they are another example
        of the highest ecological expediency of all being. Yet, we see
        another example of people's merciless, ignorant and arrogant
        attitude toward the nature in the very same location on this
        globe. The bee city is gone now. Thick streams of fertile black
        soil run off down the ruts in the former river bank cliff every
        spring. They run among filthy heaps of trash to the lifeless,
        salty puddles left behind by once a living river, which not too
        long ago was at least a string of lakes, with its countless
        flocks of sandpipers and ducks, white swans, and hovering fish
        hawks. Gone is the cliff, thinned out by bee holes, where one
        used to hear the hum of hundreds of thousands of bees, which had
        led me for the first time into the land of unknown. I must have
        tired the reader out with all these honeycombs of mine. A
        separate thick book would be required to describe all my
        experiments with them. I will only mention one more thing. My
        battery powered pocket calculator often malfunctioned in the CSE
        field. It either erred, or sometimes its display window failed
        to light up for hours. I used the field of a wasp nest combined
        with that of my two palms. None of these structures had any
        effect on their own. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also note that human hands, with all
        their tubular phalanxes, joints, ligaments, blood vessels, and
        nails are intensive CSE emanators capable of giving a powerful
        push to the straw or the charcoal rod indicator of my little
        instruments from a couple of meters distance. Practically anyone
        can do it. This is why I am convinced that there are no people
        with supersensory abilities, or rather that all the people have
        them and that the number of those, who can move light-weight
        objects across on a table from a distance, or hold them
        suspended in the air or "magnetically" attached to the hand, is
        far greater than is usually thought. Try it yourself! I look
        forward to your letters. Folks in old times used to play the
        following game: One man sits down onto a chair and four of his
        friends "build" a grid of horizontally stretched palms with
        slightly spread fingers over his head. First from their right
        hands, then from their left hands, spaced at about 2 cm. They
        hold the hand grid for about 10-15 seconds. Then all four of
        them place simultaneously their pressed-together index and
        middle fingers under the armpits and under the knees of the
        sitting man, and toss him energetically up in the air. The time
        lapse between "collapsing" the hand grid and tossing of the man
        must not exceed two seconds and the synchronicity of the action
        is very important. If everything is done right, a 100-kilo man
        flies up almost to the ceiling, while the ones who tossed him
        claim he was light as a feather. A sceptic reader may ask me:
        "How is this possible?" Doesn't it all contradict laws of
        nature? And if so, am I not propagating mysticism? Nothing of
        the sort! There is no mysticism. We humans still know little of
        the Universe which, as we see it, not always accepts our all too
        human rules, assumptions and orders and laws. It dawned on me
        once that the results of my experiments with insect nests bear
        way too much similarity to the reports of people who happened to
        be in the vicinity of UFOs. Think about it and compare the
        observations of the same phenomena in both cases. Temporary
        malfunctioning of electronic devices, disrupted clocks-time, an
        invisible, resilient obstacle to movement, a temporary drop in
        the weight of objects, the sensation of a decrease in human
        weight, phosphenes moving, colored flashes in the eyes, galvanic
        taste in the mouth. I am sure you have read about all this in
        UFO journals. I am now telling you that it can all be
        experienced in our museum. Come and visit us! Was I standing on
        the threshold of yet another mystery? Quite so. And I was helped
        again by a chance, or better said by my old insect friends. And
        there came sleepless nights and failures accompanied by doubts
        and breakdowns, even accidents and no one to turn to for an
        advice. Everyone would have just laughed, or much worse... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I can say this, my reader: "He is happy
        who has a more or less adequate use of his eyes, head, and
        hands." Skillful hands are particularly important and trust me
        that the joy of creative work, even of work that ends in
        failure, is far higher and brighter than earning any diplomas,
        medals, or patents. </p>

        <p><b>(excerpts from my diary)</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge for yourself based on my diary
        excerpts, obviously simplified and adapted for this book.
        Pictures and drawings will help you to evaluate my story. It is
        a hot summer day and the faraway expanses are drowned in a
        bluish-lilac haze. The gigantic blue dome of the sky with its
        pufs of clouds stretches over the fields and groves. I am flying
        about 300 meters above ground with a light elongated tray of a
        lake in the distant haze serving me as me as a reference point.
        Blue, intricate contours of treelines slowly recede behind, with
        fields spreading among them. That bluish-green one is an oat
        field, the whitish rectangle with a strange, rhythmic twinkling
        of the sun reflection is that of buckwheat. Straight ahead of me
        opens a field of alfalfa, with its familiar cobalt medium-green
        stolen from my oil paintings, while the green oceans of wheat to
        the right borrowed my deeper, chrome oxide shade. This enormous,
        multi-colored palette floats further and further behind me.
        Footpaths meander among the fields and coppices. They join the
        gravel roads, which it turn stretch further out to join the
        highway, still hidden in the haze. But, I know that if I flew on
        the right side of the lake, I would see it, the smooth, gray
        ribbon without a beginning or an end carrying the matchboxes of
        cars slowly crawling over its back to their destinies.
        Isometric, flat shadows of the cumulus clouds ride over the
        sunny countryside. They are deep-blue where they cover the
        threes and are of various shades of light blue where they strike
        the fields. Now I have entered the shadow of one such cloud and
        I accelerate. It is quite easy for me to do so and leave for the
        sunshine again. I lean slightly forward and feel the warm, taut
        wind coming for down below, from the sun drenched soil and
        vegetation. It does not blow from the side like when you are on
        the ground, but strangely from the surface up. I physically feel
        its thick, dense current carrying the strong smell of blooming
        buckwheat. Of course, this jet can easily lift even a large
        bird, an eagle may be, or a stork, or a crane, on their frozen,
        spread wings. </p>
      <p><b>13s.jpg (10455 bytes)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have no wings. I stand suspended in
        the air supported in my flight by a little flat, rectangular
        platform, which is slightly bigger than the seat of a chair. It
        has a pole with two handles onto which I hold and with whose
        help I navigate this device. Is this some science fiction? I
        wouldn't say so. The interrupted manuscript of this book had
        lied abandoned for two whole years because our generous, ancient
        nature had given me another something and again through my
        insect friends. As usual, it did it elegantly and
        inconspicuously, yet swiftly and convincingly. The thrill of
        discovery would not let go of me for two years, even though it
        seemed to me that I was mastering it at a break-neck speed. But
        it always happens this way. When your work is new and
        interesting, the time flies by at double its normal speed. The
        eye of the lake is already much closer. I can clearly see the
        highway beyond by now and the match boxes have grown wheels on
        them. The highway is about 8km away from the railway running
        parallel to it and if I look closer, I can see the power line
        poles on the light gray moat of the railway. It is time to turn
        some 20 degrees to the left. I can't be seen from the ground and
        not just because of the distance. I cast almost no shadow even
        in a very low flight. Yet, as I found out later, people
        sometimes see something where I am in the sky. I appear to them
        either as a light sphere, a disk, or something like a slanted
        cloud with sharp edges, which moves strangly according to them,
        not exactly the way a real cloud would. One person has observed
        a "flat, non-transparent square, about one hectare in size".
        Could it have been the optically enlarged little platform of my
        device? Most people see nothing at all though and I am quite
        pleased with it for the time being. I can't be too careful!
        Besides, I still haven't determined what my visibility or
        invisibility depended on. I must confess that I consciously
        avoid people when in flight and that I, for this very purpose,
        bypass all cities and towns and try to pass even the cross roads
        and footpaths at increased speed after making sure there is no
        one there. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I trust only my insect friends depicted in
        these pages on these excursions, which no doubt are a fiction to
        the reader but, which are already almost casual to me . The
        first practical use of my discovery has been entomological
        research. A way to get to and examine my secret places, to take
        a picture of them from above and to find new, still uninspected
        insect lands in need of protection and salvation. Alas, nature
        has established its own strict limitations on my work. Just as
        on a passenger plane, I could see but couldn't take photographs
        [taking pictures on planes was forbidden by law]. My camera
        shutter wouldn't close and both rolls of film I had with me, one
        in the camera and the other in my pocket, got light-struck. I
        didn't succeed in sketching the landscape either, because both
        my hands were almost always busy. I could only free one hand for
        a couple of seconds. Thus I could only draw from my memory. I
        managed to do that only immediately after landing. Though I am
        an artist, my visual memory is not all that great. I did not
        feel the same way in my flight as we do when we fly in our
        sleep. It was with flying in my sleep that I started this book a
        while ago. Real flying is not so much pleasure as it is work,
        sometimes very hard and dangerous at that. One has to stand, not
        hover, with both hands always busy. There is a borderline a few
        centimeters away separating "this" space from "that" on the
        outside. The border is invisible but quite treacherous. My
        contraption is still rather clumsy and resembles perhaps a
        hospital scale. But this is only the beginning! By the way,
        besides the camera, I have experiernced sometimes trouble with
        my watch and possibly also with the calendar. While descending
        onto a familiar glade, I would occasionally find it slightly
        "out of season", with about a two-week deviation but, I had
        nothing to check it against. Thus, it may be possible to fly not
        just in space but also, or so it seems, in time. I cannot make
        the latter claim with a 100% guarantee, except perhaps that in
        flight, particularly at its beginning, a watch runs eratically,
        now too slow and then too fast. But, the watch is at its
        accurate time and speed at the end of the excursions. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, this is one of the reasons why
        I stay away from people during my journeys. If time manipulation
        is involved alongside the manipulation of gravitation, I might,
        perhaps, accidentally disrupt cause-and-effect of relations and
        someone might get hurt. This is where my fears were coming from.
        Insects captured "there" disappear from my test tubes, boxes and
        other receptacles. They disappear mostly without a trace. Once I
        had a test tube crushed to tiny bits in my pocket, another time
        there was an oval hole in the tube glass with brown, as though
        chitin colored edges as you can see in the picture [above]. I
        did feel a kind of burning or an electric shock inside my pocket
        on many occasions, perhaps at the moment of my prisoner's
        disappearance. I found the captured insect in my test tube only
        once, but it wasn't the adult ichneumon with white rings on its
        feelers, but its chrysalis, i.e. its earlier stage. It was alive
        and it moved its belly when touched but, much to my dismay, it
        has died a week later. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is best to fly on clear summer days
        Flying is much more difficult when it rains and almost
        impossible in winter. Not because of the cold, since I could
        have adapted my device accordingly, but being an entomologist,
        winter trips are useless to me. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How and why did I make this discovery? I was
        examining the chitin shells of insects under my microscope in
        the summer of 1988 along with their pinnate antennae, the
        fish-scale microstructure of butterfly wings, iridescent colors,
        and other inventions of nature. I became interested in an
        amazingly rhythmical microstructure of one large insect detail.
        It was an extremely well-ordered composition, as though stamped
        out by factory equipment according to special blueprints and
        calculations. As I saw it, the intricate <b><i>sponginess</i></b>
        was clearly unnecessary either for the strength of the part, or
        for its decoration. I have never observed anything like this
        unusual micro-ornament either in nature, in technology, or in
        art. Because its structure is three-dimensional, I have been
        unable to capture it in a drawing so far, or a photograph. Why
        does an insect need it? Besides, other than in flight, this
        structure at the bottom of the wing case is always hidden from
        the eye. No one would ever see it properly. Was it perhaps the
        wave emitter using "my" multiple cavity structures effect? That
        truly lucky summer, there were very many insects of this species
        and I would capture them at night. I was not able to observe
        these insects neither before, nor later. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed the small, <b><i>concave</i></b>
        chitin plate on the microscope stage in order to again examine
        its strangely <b><i>star-shaped cells</i></b> under strong
        magnification. I again admired this masterpiece jewelwork of
        nature. I was about to place a second identical plate with the
        same unusual cell structure on its underside almost purposelesly
        on top of the first one. But then! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little plate came loose from my
        tweezers, hung suspended above the other plate on the microscope
        stage for a few seconds, then turned a few degrees clockwise and
        slid to the right, then turned counterclockwise and swung and
        only then it abruptly fell on the desk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can imagine what I felt at that moment.
        When I came to my senses, I tied a few panels together with a
        wire and it wasn't an easy thing to do. I succeeded only when I
        <b><i>positioned them vertically</i></b>. What I got was a <b><i>multi-layered










            chitin block</i></b> and I placed it on the desk. Even a
        relatively large object, such as a thumbtack, would not fall on
        it. Something pushed it up and aside. When I attached the tack
        on top of the "block", I witnessed incredible, impossible
        things. The tack would dissapear from sight for a few moments.
        That was when I have realized that this was no "beacon," but
        something entirely different. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I became again so excited that all the
        objects around me became foggy and shaky. I managed to pull
        myself together with huge effort in a couple of hours and I
        continued working. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it all started. Of course, much
        still remains to be understood, verified, and tested. I will
        certainly tell my readers about the finer details of my machine,
        about its propulsion principles, about distances, heights,
        speeds, equipment and all the rest but, in my next book. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have conducted my first, rather
        unsuccessful and highly dangerous flight on the night of March
        17, 1990. I didn't have the patience to wait untill the warm
        season and I neglected to go to a deserted area. I already knew
        that night was the most dangerous time for this kind of work and
        I had a bad luck from the very start. The panel blocks in the
        right side of the lifting platform got repetitively stuck. I
        should have fixed the problem properly and immediately, yet I
        neglected to do so in my impatience. I took off right in the
        middle of the Agricultural Academy campus, erroneously assuming
        that everyone would be asleep at 1 after midnight and that
        nobody would see me. The lift-off went well but, I became dizzy
        in a few seconds time, while the lit windows of the campus
        buildings sank beneath me. I should have landed right then yet,
        I made the mistake of staying airborne. A powerful force
        snatched away my control over my movement and weight and it
        dragged me in the direction of the city. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crossed the second circle of the
        nine-story buildings in the city's residential area (they are
        laid out in two huge circles with five-story buildings,
        including ours, inside them) drawn by this unexpected and
        uncontrollable power and then I crossed a snow-covered, narrow
        field and the Academy City highway. The dark immensity of
        Novosibirsk was closing in upon me and it was closing in fast. I
        was already near a bunch of tall factory smoke stacks, many of
        which belched thick smoke into the cold night sky. The graveyard
        shift was on. I had to do something and do it quickly. I got on
        top of the situation only with great effort. I finally managed
        to perform an emergency adjustment of the panel blocks and my
        horizontal movement slowed down, but I became quite sick now. I
        succeed in stopping the horizontal movement only at my fourth
        attempt, at which point my platform hung over the city's
        industrial district Zatulinka. The sinister smoke stacks fumed
        silently right beneath me. I took a short rest, if one can call
        a few minutes of hanging over a lighted factory fence a rest and
        I glided back after I made sure that the "evil power" has
        passed. I did not fly straight back in the direction of our
        Agricultural Academy campus though, but to the right of it,
        toward the airport. I did this to foul the trail, in case
        someone had seen me. I turned abruptly home only when I was over
        dark, deserted night fields about halfway to the airport, where
        I was sure that there was clearly no one around. I naturally
        couldn't get out of bed the next day. The news on TV and in the
        newspapers was more than alarming. Headlines, such as "UFO over
        Zatulinka" and "Aliens again?" meant that my flight had been
        detected. But how! Some perceived the "phenomenon" as glowing
        spheres or disks, many actually saw not one sphere but two!
        Others claimed that they had seen a "real saucer" with windows
        and rays of light. I am not discounting the possibility that
        some Zatulino residents saw something else entirely, rather than
        my near-emergency evolutions, somehing that had nothing to do
        with me. Besides that, March of 1990 was particularly rich in
        UFO sightings in Siberia, near Nalchik. There was also some
        heavy UFO trafic in Belgium where, according to Pravda, an
        engineer Marcel Alferlane took a two-minute film of the flight
        of a huge triangular craft on March 31. According to Belgian
        scientists, it was a "material object with a capacity no
        civilization could currently create." Is it really so? As for
        me, I would suggest that the gravitational filter platforms (or
        as I call them, panel blocks) of these machines were in fact
        small, triangular and made here on Earth but, with more
        sophistication than my half-wooden contraption. I also wanted to
        make my platform triangular, because it would be much safer and
        efficient that way, but I chose a rectangular design because it
        is easier to fold and once folded, it may resemble a suitcase,
        or a painter's case and it can be therefore disguised and not
        arouse any suspicions. I have naturally chosen a painter's case.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had nothing to do with the sightings in
        Nalchik or Belgium. Besides, as it appears, I am very
        impractical in the use of my discovery. I fly only to my
        entomological preserves. These are far more important to me than
        any technological finds. I have eleven such preserves at the
        moment, eight in Omsk region, one in Voronezh region and one
        near Novosibirsk. There used to be six of them in Novosibirsk
        region, all of them created, or rather saved by me and my family
        for the time being, but they don't like them here. Neither the
        Agricultural Academy (still more obsessed with "chemistry" than
        with anything else), nor the Environmental Protection Committee
        were willing to help me preserve these little islands from evil,
        ignorant people. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I am continuing my journey
        westward under the magnificent, fluffy noon clouds, with the
        blue shadows of the clouds, the intricately shaped coppices and
        the multicolored patches of fields floating back below me. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speed of my flight is quite high but,
        there is no wind in my ears. The platform's force field has
        "carved out" an upward-diverging, invisible column from space,
        which cuts the platform off the earth's gravitational pull. Yet,
        it leaves me and the air inside the column intact. I think that
        it parts space in flight and then closes it behind me. This must
        be the reason for my invisibility, or the distorted visibility
        of the device and its "rider", as was the case with my flight
        over Novosibirsk's Zatulinka suburb. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protection from gravity is regulated
        albeit not entirely. When I move my head forward, I can already
        feel the turbulence of the wind that clearly smells either of
        sweet clover, of buckwheat, or of the colored, wild weeds of
        Siberian meadows. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave Isilkul with its huge grain elevator
        to my right and begin to gradually descend over the highway,
        making sure that I am invisible to the drivers, passengers and
        the people working in the fields. My platform and I cast no
        shadow (although the shadow occasionally appears). I see three
        kids by the treeline of a forest and I descent dropping my speed
        and fly right by them. They don't react to me, which means that
        everything is fine. Neither I, nor my shadow are visible and
        they don't hear me either. The propulsion principle of my device
        makes my platform completely quiet, because there is practically
        no air friction. My journey has been a long one, at least forty
        minutes from Novosibirsk. My hands are tired because I can't
        take them off from the controls and so are my legs and body. I
        have to stand up straight, tied to the vertical pole with a
        belt. Even though I could travel faster, I am still afraid to do
        so considering how small and fragile is my hand-made machine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise up again and forward and I soon see
        the familiar landmark, a road intersection with a passenger
        terminal on the right side of the highway. Another five
        kilometers and I finally see the orange posts of the preserve
        fence. The preserve, come to think of it, is twenty years old
        now. How many times have I saved this child of mine from trouble
        and bureaucrats, from chemical laden aircraft, from fires and
        many other evils. And the "Land of Insects" is still alive and
        well! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can already see the thicket of carrot weed
        and make out the light heads of their flowers resembling azure
        balls, while descending and braking. This I achieve by
        cross-shifting the filter blinds under the platform's board. The
        carrot weed is covered with insects of course and an incredible
        joy overcomes my fatigue, for it was I, who has saved this patch
        on Earth, as small as it is, less than seven hectares [18
        acres]. No one has driven here, no one has cut the grass or
        tended cattle for twenty years here and the soil has risen in
        places to fourteen centimeters high. Not only did several
        locally extinct species of insects return here but, also such
        weeds as feather grass of rare variety returned along with the
        purple Scorzonera, whose large flowers smell of chocolate in the
        morning. I can smell the thick odor of cuckoo flower and only
        this Middle Glade smells like that. It is right behind the fence
        of the preserve and fills me once again with the joyful
        anticipation of another encounter with the "World of Insects".
        Here they are. I can see them very well even from ten meters
        above the ground, the wide umbrellas and azure balls of Angelica
        and carrot plants. Dark orange butterflies sitting on them in
        groups and heavy hornets bow the white and yellow inflorescences
        of Lady's Bedstraws and ginger. Blue damselflies with trembling
        wide wings interwoven by a fine network of veins hover next to
        my head. I slow down even more and all of a sudden I see my
        shadow flash below me. Hitherto invisible, it has finally
        appeared and now it slowly glides along weeds and bushes. But I
        am already safe. there is not a soul around and the highway some
        three hundred meters north of the preserve is now empty. I can
        land. The stems of the tallest weeds rustle against the bottom
        of my "podium", my platform with the panel blocks. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Victor%20S.%20Grebennikov_%20Insect%20Chitin%20Anti-Gravity%20&amp;%20Cavity%20Structural%20Effect%20(CSE)_files/214.jpg" width="129" height="362"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, before setting it down on top of a
        little bump, I again spread the blinds with my control handle in
        a fit of joy and rise vertically up, high into the sky. The
        landscape below quickly shrinks and the horizon begins to curve
        on all sides in a huge dip opening up the sight of railroad that
        runs two kilometers on the left with the village on the right of
        it twinkling with its light slate roofs. Further on the right
        lies Roslavka, the central estate of the Lesnoy State Farm,
        which already looks like a small city. Cow farms of the Lesnoy's
        Komsomolsk branch surrounded by a yellow ring of straw and dry,
        foot-worn manure are to the left of the railroad. I can
        recognize a few small houses and the neat white cube of the
        Yunino railroad terminal some 6km away in the west, where the
        smooth curve of the railroad disappears (this is somewhat
        confusing, because the railway is actually straight as an
        arrow). Beyond Yunino spread the limitless expanses of
        Kazakhstan, drowning in the hot, bluish haze of this hot summer
        day. Finally, right below me, lies my Isilkulia. The land of my
        youth looks very different from how it appears on maps and plans
        with their inscriptions and signs. It is vast, limitless, alive.
        It is interspersed with dark, intricate islands of woods, cloudy
        shadows and bright clear eyes of the lakes. The huge disk of the
        earth with all this beneath me appears more and more concave for
        some reason and I still haven't found out the reason for this
        already familiar illusion. I rise still higher and the rare,
        white cloud masses sink lower and lower and the sky above turns
        much darker blue. The fields protruding between the clouds are
        already covered with the thickening blue haze and they are more
        and more difficult to distinguish. Too bad I can't take my
        four-year-old grandson Andrei with me. The platform could easily
        lift us both but, one can't be too careful. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodness, what am I doing? I have cast a
        shadow back on the Glade, didn't I? This means that I can be
        seen by thousands, as on that memorable night in March. It is
        daytime now and I may again appear as a disk, square, or even
        worse, as my own person. And over there, there is also a cargo
        plane approaching me, still silent but, quickly growing in size.
        I can already see the cold shimmer off its body and the flashing
        of its unnaturally red warning light. Down, quick! I brake
        abruptly and make a turn. The sun is at my back and my shadow
        should be across from me, impressed on top of the gigantic,
        convex wall of a white cloud. But there is no shadow. Only the
        rainbow glory of the iridescent bright ring familiar to all
        pilots has brushed the cloud ahead of me. I sigh with relief,
        because this means that nobody saw either me, or my "double" in
        the guise of a triangle, square, or a "common" saucer. A thought
        occurs to me (I must say that despite the desperate technical
        and physical inconvenience, imagination works much better and
        faster in a "falling" flight): "What if I am not the only one
        out of the five billion people to have made my discovery? What
        if flying devices based on the same principle, both home-made
        and professional, have long been constructed and tested?" </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all screening platforms have the same
        quality. They become visible to other people sometimes. The
        pilots themselves are "transformed" and they are observed as
        "humanoids" in silver suits, either short and green, or flat as
        if made of cardboard (Voronezh, 1989) etc. Thus, it may very
        well be that these are not alien UFO crewmen, but only people
        who appear "temporarily deformed" to the outside observers. It
        may very well be that they are earthly pilots and builders of
        little platforms, such as mine, who have made their inventions
        reliable. My advice to those, who in their study of insects come
        across the same phenomenon and begin making and testing a
        "gravitoplane" (by the way, I am convinced that one can't make
        the discovery without insects) is this: "Fly only on fine summer
        days. Avoid working in thunderstorms or rain. Do not operate the
        platform too far or too high. Do not take anything with you from
        the landing area. Make all assembly units as strong as possible
        and avoid testing of the device in the vicinity of any power
        lines, towns (let alone cities), transport, or people." The best
        site for testing is a distant forest glade, as far away from
        human habitation as possible. Otherwise you may cause a
        phenomenon known as poltergeist in the radius of a few dozen
        meters with "unexplained" movements of household objects,
        switching on and off of household electric appliances and even
        causing fires. I myself have no explanation for all this, but it
        seems that these phenomena are the consequence of temporal
        disruptions, a complicated and treacherous activity. Not a
        single, even tiniest fragment or particle should be dropped
        either during the flight, or in the landing area. Let us
        remember the Dalnegorsk phenomenon of January 29, 1986,
        apparently a tragic one for the inventors, when the entire
        device was blown apart and scattered over a vast area. Only
        small shreds of filter cells were found, impossible to analyze
        chemically (as it should be!). Remember, I wrote that insects
        taken from "there" and moved "over here" disappeared from their
        test tubes with hole formed in the tubes, if they remained
        intact at all. It turns out that these holes resemble simmilar
        holes in windows plate glass. The latter sometimes appear in
        residential and office buildings, occasionally in "bursts" in
        the windows of several rooms and floors. A hole is 3-5 mm on the
        outside, widening in a cone to he inside, with exit diameter of
        6-15 mm. Some holes are melted or colored brown on edges, just
        as it happened in the case of my insect in my test tube. It
        seems that this type of poltergeist isn't caused, as I used to
        believe, by short-lived microplasmoids of tiny ball lightning
        type, but by particles and specks carelessly dropped while
        testing a device similar to mine. The photographs of window
        holes on these pages are documentary and made by me at the
        scientific center of the Agricultural Academy near Novosibirsk.
        I can show them to anyone who wants to see them. These holes
        appeared during 1975-1990, but none of them, except perhaps the
        very last one, are related to my flights. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am certain that part of UFO descriptions
        are actually those of platforms, panel blocks and other large
        parts of devices deliberately or accidentally taken out of the
        active field by their designers and makers. These fragments are
        capable of causing much trouble to others, or at best, to
        generate a series of improbable tales and stories in papers and
        magazines, often accompanied by "scientific" commentaries... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I not disclosing the particulars of
        my discovery at this time? Firstly, because one needs time and
        energy for proving the truth. I have neither. I know how
        daunting is this task from my own bitter experience of trying to
        get recognition for my previous discoveries, including such an
        obvious one as the Cavity Structures Effect of whose reality
        you, my readers, I am sure, are by now convinced. This was the
        result of my protracted, painstaking efforts to get the CSE
        scientifically recognized. "Any further correspondence with you
        on the subject of your patent application is counterproductive."
        I know personally some of the High Priests of Science and I am
        certain that were I ever to get an audience with one such person
        (which is now practically impossible), were I ever to open my
        painter's case, attach its pole to it and turn the handles and
        soar to the ceiling, he wouldn't be a bit impressed, or worse
        still, he would order the trickster out of the office. I look
        forward to times when young people will replace these "priests".
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason for my "non-disclosure" is
        more objective. I have found these antigravitational structures
        only in one species of Siberian insects. I dare not even naming
        the class to which this insect belongs, because it seems to be
        on the verge of extinction and the population surge, which I had
        registered back then, was possibly local and final. Now, what
        would be the guarantee that dishonest people, half competent in
        biology, would not rush out to ravines, meadows and forests to
        catch perhaps the very last samples of this miracle of nature,
        if I were to name the genus and the species? What are the
        guarantees that they would not plough up hundreds of glades and
        cut down dozens of forests to get to this potentially lucrative
        prey? Therefore, let all I have related in this chapter and in
        the addendum remain science fiction. May nature herself never
        reveal this secret to them. It would take a lot of effort and
        they would never be able to get it by force as there are still
        several million insect species living on the planet. Spend at
        least an hour on the morphological study of each of them, then
        calculate the odds of encountering the unusual and I will
        sincerely wish you diligence and a very long life, for even if
        you took no days off, working eight hours a day, you would need
        a thousand years of life. I hope I will be understood and
        forgiven by those of my readers who wanted immediate information
        about my discovery not for selfish ends, but simply out of
        curiosity. Indeed, what would you do in my place if you were to
        act in the best interests of The Living Nature? Besides, I can
        see that similar inventions have been made by other people who
        are also in no rush to take their discoveries to bureaucrats'
        offices, who prefer to fly across night skies in the guise of
        strange disks, triangles, or squares which suprise eyewitnesses
        with their iridescent flickering... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... I orient myself falling down, or rather
        sinking and look around to see, if there is anyone around. I
        brake abruptly about forty meters from the ground and land
        safely where I always do, on a tiny glade in the Big Forest of
        the preserve. You won't find it on a map and if you get there,
        you won't be able to find it either. Don't judge me for the fact
        that the branches of several aspens there are cut or sliced "by
        lightning". The strictly vertical take-off and landing are very
        difficult and the initial trajectory is for the most part
        slanted, particularly at take-off, when the platform is for some
        reason carried off away from the sun and sometimes the other way
        around... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I loosen the screws on the control pole,
        then shorten it like a telescoping antenna of a portable radio
        and remove it from the platform. I fold the platform in half.
        Now it looks like a painter's case, if only a bit thicker. I put
        the case, some food and a few tools for repairing of the fence
        into my backpack and make my way for the Middle Glade among the
        aspens and the short dog-rose bushes. I see a good omen even
        before leaving the forest, a family of fire-red toadstools that
        have lined up on the forest bedding in a wide curve, or, as it
        used to be called in our folklore, a "witch's ring". Why
        "witch's"? And in general: "Why does one have to break, knock
        off and trample this beautiful mushroom of Siberian forests?"
        [Vandalism] I often asked mushroom-pickers why they do it. The
        answer was, "because it's inedible!" But turf, clay, twigs, tree
        stumps and stones are inedible too. If there were rocks lying in
        the forest instead of mushrooms, no one would be knocking them
        off. It seems that inedible mushrooms are knocked off because
        they are alive. Ignorant people trample and kick them only to
        kill them! What is this then? Do people really have it in their
        blood to kill a mushroom or to crush a bug and to shoot a bird,
        a hare, or a bison? And is this not where boorishness, sadism,
        pogroms and wars originate? One really does not want to believe
        it. I put myself in the shoes of an alien. I come to Earth to
        visit humans and see them knock off mushrooms, crush insects and
        shoot birds and each other. What would I do? I would immediately
        turn my spacecraft around and go back. I wouldn't return for at
        least 500 earth years. What would you do, my reader, if you were
        an alien? It's a good thing that at least this little family of
        toadstools is hidden from evil eyes and cruel feet. It gives me
        joy to see its special life every summer, to see its
        cinnabar-red, moist caps with large, whitish scales underneath.
        But here is the glade. I walk on it as usual, with my heart
        sinking with a constant longing for this dear, faraway nature of
        Isilkul, with fear that some "master" might decide to plough it
        up and with joy that it is still unploughed, uncut, and
        untrampled. It really means nothing that I have a folded,
        incapacitated platform with gravitational, micro-cellular filter
        blocks in my backpack, along with the folded pole and the field
        regulators and the belt, with which I fasten myself to the pole.
        What difference does it make that I moved about fifty years
        ahead of the contemporary science with my discovery? People are
        eventually and certainly going to master this and many other
        mysteries of matter, space, gravitation and time. But no
        supercivilization on any planet of any supergalaxy is going to
        re-create this very glade with its complex, fragile, trembling
        life, with its lady's bedstraws, meadow sweets and feather
        grass. Where else, in what corner of the universe, are you going
        to find a match for this lilac-blue bell flower with two flower
        flies performing their love dance in its semi-transparent
        entrails? On what other planet would a nearly tame blue
        butterfly land on your outstretched hand to have a taste of
        something salty, a sausage, or cheese, or a pickle? Or else,
        just to walk up and down your palm, opening and closing its gray
        wings on whose backside there is a fine ornament of round eyes?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... It hasn't been too long since we,
        humans, started flying the first air balloons and later
        airplanes and still later the powerful rockets that we send to
        other heavenly bodies. What's next? Next we are going to fly to
        other stars at a speed close to that of light. But, even the
        closest galaxy would still be out of reach. Yet the humankind,
        if it ever earns the name of intelligent, will solve many
        riddles of the universe and will then overcome this hurdle too.
        Then any worlds in the universe will become accessible, close
        even if they are trillions of light years away. It'll happen,
        for it is all a matter of reason, science and technology. Only
        this glade may disappear if I, and there is no one else to rely
        on, am not going to preserve it for my close and distant
        descendants. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what is more valuable to humanity at
        this time? Is it the insect preserve, or is it the home-made
        device capable of developing the vertical pull of at least 100
        kg and the horizontal speed of 30-40 km/min? I am asking you, my
        reader. But think hard before you give a serious, responsible
        answer. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at these pictures. This is my rather
        simple device in assembly. A flexible cable inside the steering
        column trasmits the movement from the left handle to the
        gravitational louvers. I lift off or land by joining or parting
        these "wing cases". </p>

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I lost the left handle in a
        free-falling descent and would have been in a better world if
        the platform hadn't dug out a rather deep well in the tillage,
        first a vertical one, then horizontal, facing away from the sun.
        Thus I not only survived, but I also felt almost no impact, just
        darkness. I extracted myself and my fairly badly damaged device
        from this well, although not without effort, because the "well"
        had no slag heaps! I had to use all my ingenuity to disguise it.
        If it were seen from the road, it would have caused much
        speculation and may even have led some over-zealous
        investigators to the culprit. Similar wells, also with the
        side-tunnel and without slag heaps, were suddenly formed on
        October 24, 1989 in the fields of Khvorostyansk District of
        Samara Region. Komsomolskaya Pravda [magazine] described it in
        detail on December 6. of the same year and it seems that I am
        not alone. I am quite likely "inventing a bicycle". Well,
        actually the top part of my device looks very much like one. The
        right handle is used for horizontal motion, also achieved via a
        cable, regulating the incline of both groups of the "wing case"
        blinds. I never fly faster than 25 km/min and I prefer to go ten
        times slower. I don't know whether I have persuaded you, my
        reader, that similar devices will soon be available to
        practically everyone, while the living nature, without which
        humans cannot survive, won't be available to anyone if we don't
        save it and preserve it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't want to seem to be entirely
        greedy and I will give researchers another patent of nature. It
        is also related to movement and gravitation. Physicists say that
        a reactionless motor is impossible. In other words, a device
        completely isolated from the environment won't fly or drive. A
        car won't move without wheels in contact with the road, a plane
        won't fly with a covered propeller and neither will a rocket fly
        with plugged nozzles. Baron Mnchhausen, who has managed to pull
        himself up by the hair from a mire was the only exception. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened near Novosibirsk in 1981, when
        we were studying the entomo-fauna of alfalfa, its pollinators
        and pests. I was "mowing" alfalfa with an insect net wading
        through the field and collecting the contents of the net, the
        insects, leaves and flowers, into a glass jar. Such is the cruel
        method of studying the insect make-up of the fields, because
        none better has been invented as yet. Alas, such was the work,
        with which I earned my living at the Institute of Agricultural
        Chemistry. I was about to throw a piece of ethered cotton wool
        into the jar and then cap it, when a light little cocoon jumped
        up at me. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was oval-shaped, rather dense and
        non-transparent. One of the little "prisoners" in the jar must
        have pushed it. Cocoons can't jump on their own! But the cocoon
        proved me wrong. It jumped up one more time, hit the glass wall
        and fell down. I took it out and put it into a separate test
        tube. I looked at it through a binocular microscope at home and
        I have found nothing special about it. It was a cocoon like any
        other, about 3 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. Its walls felt strong to
        the touch as they should. But the cocoon energetically jumped
        when lit or warmed by the sun but, it was quiet in the dark. It
        could jump 30mm lengthwise and, what I found even more
        remarkable, up to 50mm high. As far as I could tell, it flew
        smoothly, almost without tumbling. No doubt, the larva of the
        insect was responsible for the movement. But it was impossible
        to see how it did it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Jumping ahead, I can tell you that the
        cocoon finally produced a male insect of the ichneumon family,
        the <b><i>Batiplectes anurus</i></b> species. It is beneficial
        for agriculture because its larvae parasitize the alfalfa
        weevil. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flying cocoon will jump untill it has
        finally landed in a cool place, for example a crack in the
        ground. It must have found itself in my net during its strange
        flying journey, at the moment of its jump. It all resembled
        poltergeist unexplained "jumps" of household objects, many times
        described in papers. I have placed the cocoon on glass to look
        at it from below. Could it be that the larva draws in its bottom
        and then abruptly releases it? Nothing of the kind. There were
        no dents at any point and the cocoon jumped no matter which way
        I rolled it. It was also remarkable that it jumped sideways from
        the horizontal, smooth and slippery glass pane. I have measured
        its trajectories. They were up to 35 mm long and up to 50 mm
        high. This means that the cocoon lifted itself up to a height 30
        times its own width! Shall I leave this capsule without support?
        But how? With a piece of loose cotton wool! I have fluffed up a
        piece of cotton wool and I have placed the cocoon on this cotton
        cloud. I have brought it out into the sun and impatiently
        waited. If the cocoon's inhabitant jumps by hitting the lower
        wall, making the cocoon to bounce off its support, it should not
        work this time. The impact should be absorbed by the thin fibers
        of the cotton. Theoretically, the cocoon shouldn't even move.
        But no, it takes off from its motionless pad, up and aside, as
        it did before. I measure its broad jump at 42 mm, about as good
        as as before. The insect must have been hitting not the bottom,
        but the top part of the cocoon at any rate. It must have been
        doing something that caused the capsule to move. Frankly
        speaking, it is as I write these notes that I feel agitation. I
        found nothing supernatural in the jumps of my tiny prisoner back
        in 1981. This was because I knew that, according to physics,
        there can be no reactionless motors. Otherwise I would have bred
        a couple of hundred of those insects. Thankfully, they are quite
        common and I would have studied the phenomenon thoroughly. Now,
        let us fantasize a little: "What if the batiplectes wanted to
        leave the Earth? An adult, winged insect would have no luck
        because our atmosphere is quite rarefied up the top and wings
        are no match for it. A larva in a cocoon is an entirely
        different matter. It could in theory, after lifting its capsule
        5 cm in a jump, take it up even further while still in the air
        and then again and again. If the cocoon were airtight, I mean if
        the pilot had sufficient air reserve for breathing, the device
        would be able to leave the atmosphere and would have no
        obstacles to a limitless build-up of speed. Such is the
        alluring, incredible value of reactionless motors, declared,
        alas, a product of empty fantasy. But even if you are no
        physicist, you still have a hard time imagining what a tiny
        larva does in there if its vessel soars 5 cm high. It simply
        can't be ...and yet it jumps! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicists say that this is "beyond science"
        as it "contradicts the laws of nature." The only problem is that
        the Batiplectes anurus doesn't know it. The physicists' ban must
        also have been unknown to the leading, experienced biologists
        who honestly wrote the following on page 26 of the academic
        Register of Insects of European USSR (vol. III, pt. 3): "The
        cocoon jumps up as a result of abrupt movements of the larva
        inside the cocoon." Shortly, it is a working and tested example
        of a safe, reactionless drive. I am giving it to you, to my
        reader. Invent, design and build but, hurry! Massive chemical
        warfare has been waged against the alfalfa pest, the snout
        beetle (phitonomus). Humanity may actually win it. Yet, the
        price may be too great. Our planet's fauna may also lose the
        ichneumon Batiplectes anurus as it parasitizes only this kind of
        weevil and cannot survive without it. It will dissapear with the
        destruction of the Phitonomus varnabilis beetle. Meanwhile, any
        proposals on using biological weapons against the pest, such as
        our very ichneumon and other insect predators are completely
        rejected by the bosses of Russian agriculture and agricultural
        science. I have been fighting them on this for decades, but like
        Don Quixote, so far with little success. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, one could understand those in
        charge too. How can one stop the expensive chemical factories?
        And why do agrarian scientists care about some reactionless
        drive that doesn't allow alfalfa to be treated with a poison?
        Hurry up, biologists, engineers, physicists! For if Chemistry
        wins, this mystery along with a host of other mysteries related
        to it will leave people for ever. Without insects, people won't
        invent it themselves. Please trust me, an entomologist with 60
        years of experience. There is a drawing at the end of my first
        book, "A Million Riddles", published in Novosibirsk in 1968,
        which I have reproduced here again. A drawing of a man flying
        over Novosibirsk's Academic City. He is flying a device based on
        a huge pair of insect wings. I dreamed of inventing such a
        machine at the time. Strangely, the dream came true precisely
        because of my friendship with insects yet, not by blindly
        copying the most noticeable parts, the wings that only make me
        smile now but, through careful study of living nature. Nothing
        would have been possible without my six-legged friends. No one
        would be able to do without them either. Thus safeguard their
        world, the ancient, wonderful world of insect, for it is an
        infinite, unique treasure of nature's mysteries! I beg you all,
        take care of it! </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial honeycomb</i> --- Take a dozen
        and a half papier-mache supermarket egg cases (30-egg variety),
        tie them up or glue them together (one on top of another) in
        such a way as to join the "teeth" to one another rather than to
        the hollows. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have large cells similar to the
        multi-cellular combs of a certain "paper" wasp but, much bigger.
        Afix the whole set of cells (they can be enclosed in a case)
        over the head of a person sitting in a chair with the bottom
        "comb" about 10-20 cm above the head. Let the person sit there
        for 10-15 min. The "unnatural", unusual transformation of the
        spatial shape formed by the set can be picked up even by the
        palm of your hand. Experiment with sprouting seeds, or breeding
        microorganisms and insects under the "macrocomb" and compare the
        results with those of identical experiments conducted at least 2
        m away from the comb. Repeat each pair of experiments several
        times. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron comb</i> --- Test the impact of
        common kitchen shredders piled up one on top of another with
        their wire-edges down in a similar way, with the small hole
        shredders at the bottom and the large hole ones at the top. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paper Combs</i> --- Cut apart 6 sheets of
        office paper lengthwise and fold each of them like a bellows so,
        that you get 10 edges and 20 planes on each. Squeeze the bellows
        so that the sheets are square now, rather then rectangular and
        glue them on top of one another, turning each consecutive sheet
        horizontally 30 degrees clockwise against the bottom one. Then
        glue together (preferably out of dark paper) a conical,
        multi-layered "flower" with a few dozen petals and fluff up the
        petals. Test the emanators by holding your palm above the
        "flower" and underneath the suspended bellows. Place the bellows
        and then the flower above the head of a sitting person and
        record his/her sensations. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plastic Foam</i> --- We are used to the
        fact that this excellent thermal insulator "reflects" the warmth
        of the hand even at a distance. But, even if you cover it with
        dark paper, cardboard, or a tin plate, it will still do the
        same. This happens due to the work of multiple vesicular
        cavities of the material producing the CSE. Foam rubber. It is
        widely known that a person used to sleeping on let's say a
        cotton wool mattress doesn't sleep well at first on a rubber
        foam one, or else is unable to sleep at all. This is a typical
        manifestation of the CSE. The organism eventually adapts itself
        to this new bed. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mushroom CSE</i> --- A hunter once told
        me that he warms his hands up in winter on bracket-fungi. Let us
        recall that the underside of this tree fungi is full of fine
        spore tubes. What the hunter felt was not warmth but, a typical
        CSE. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving combs ---</i> Make a wooden top
        and drill several holes about a pencil size through it. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their CSE field perception significantly
        increases when the top is spinning. This is easily perceived by
        the palm of the hand and it is due to the fact that the cavities
        must be numerically multiplying in space. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flower CSE</i> --- An "unnatural"
        position of such a seemingly common and pleasant object as a
        living flower can also change its properties. Place a bunch of
        several dozen bell-shaped flowers (like tulips, primroses,
        lilies or bell-flowers) upside down above the head of a sitting
        person. Enclose the flowers in a plastic bag in order to prevent
        the impact of their smell. Write to me about your results. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wind-fallen trees</i>: One of my test
        subjects, a geographer, told me about experiencing the effect of
        one of my "grids". He said that he once had a similar sensation
        many years ago, when he was passing a wind-fallen section of a
        forest. His head, ears, mouth and the entire body felt something
        particularly unpleasant and it had felt the same as what he felt
        under my grid. This means that the abruptly disrupted shape of
        the normal multi-cavity space of the forest emanated CSE waves
        for some time, which were unpleasant to humans. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the rain</i>: Run cold water
        through the shower and slowly move your hand toward the stream
        of the dropletts from the side. Most people feel "warmth" from
        the shower. In reality, this is the CSE reinforced by the motion
        of ever new elements of the "multi-layered" grid of water drops
        and gaps between them. After practicing in the bathroom, try to
        pick up an even stronger CSE from fountains and waterfalls. A
        shroud of a distant rainfall creates a powerful CSE field, which
        has its impact on a large area, even when the atmospheric
        pressure is high at your location. Have you ever felt sleepy
        before the rain? Even in enclosed premises? The CSE cannot be
        screened off. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Book CSE</i> --- Take a thick, preferably
        well-read book and stand it upright on the edge of a desk with
        its back facing the direction of the sun (north at night). Open
        the book and fluff up its pages as evenly as possible. You
        should be able to pick up some of the sensations mentioned in
        this chapter with your palm, tongue, or back of your head in a
        few minutes (the CSE does not appear immediately and it doesn't
        disappear immediately either). This "stream" can be picked up at
        a 2-3 meters' distance after some practice. It is also easy to
        verify that the "book CSE" is also non-screenable. You can ask
        someone to stand between your hand and the book. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large Cones with an artificial comb
          filling and three magnets at the back</i><b> ---</b> Two
        similar cones were positioned against each other with respect to
        the sun, one in Isilkul and the other one near Novosibirsk. They
        were thrown appart and demolished on the moring of April 23,
        1991. The one in Novosibirsk was unfolded and pressed into the
        wall of an underground hiding place and its magnets disappeared.
        Some residents of an Omsk apartment experienced a series of
        strangest "poltergeists" (see Vechernii Omsk from April 26. and
        Omsk and Moscow TV broadcasts) at the same moment. The same
        paper called the device in the picture "Grebenikov's hyperboloid
        on August 5, 1991. exactly because of this "coincidence". One of
        the "beams" of the upright electronic waves between the two
        conical structures may have actually been formed precisely
        there, on the river Irtysh embankment in Omsk. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium Cones</i><b> ---</b> Insert a
        dozen plastic household funnels tightly into each other and fix
        the structure on any support with the nozzles turned toward the
        sun. Cover the bell end of the top funnel with a net or light
        blue cloth (so that the tested subjects do not anticipate heat).
      </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small Cone</i> --- Roll up tightly two
        unusable rolls of film. Tie them up with a string and press a
        bell-shaped cavity in the middle of the top roll. CSE emanations
        can be easily picked up by the palm of your hand, particularly
        in the counter-solar position. You will get interesting
        sensations if you press this "micro-cone" to your forehead. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perpetual Motion Machine</i><b> ---</b> I
        had suspended this straw indicator designed for registering CSE
        emanations, on a cobweb thread. Then I surrounded my above
        described device with seven funnel-shaped rolls of film. As one
        straw is slowly leaving the zone of impact of one roll, it will
        enter the power field of another roll, then the third, and so on
        and the detector will keep spinning. This experiment works the
        best in a sound-proofed chamber, away from wires, pipes, sources
        of heat, cold and even bright light. There is no miracle in it:
        matter is eternal in its endless movement. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Solar Ether and the Beam Radiator</i>
        --- This intricate name was devised by the Leipzig professor
        Otto Kornschelt who discovered the CSE over 100 years ago and
        produced devices for its practical application in medicine,
        agriculture and technology. Rhythmic cavities were formed in
        them by copper chains. The devices were positioned with their
        backsides facing the sun. It is indeed true that new inventions
        are simply well forgotten old ones. The sensations described by
        Kornschelt are identical to the ones, which I have experienced
        in my own, independent work. I have learned about Korschelt's
        experiments only very recently, from M. Platten's "<i>New
          Medical Technique</i>", vol. III, St. Petersburg, 1886, where
        the following drawing of the device is reproduced. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sieve CSE</i><b> ---</b> In the old days,
        headaches and concussion symptoms were treated with an ordinary
        flour sieve held above the head of the patient, net up, in
        several areas of the globe. The patient squeezed the sieve rim
        between the teeth, with the net in front of the face in an
        alternate method. The sieve material is unimportant. The device
        works better if the patient faces the sun (north at midnight).
        This type of CSE is also perceivable by healthy people. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planetary CSE ---</i> The planets of our
        Solar system are situated at certain distances from the sun. The
        Titus-Bode formula for the distance is this: 4 is added to the
        numbers 3, 6, 12, 36, etc (a geometrical progression) and the
        resulting number is divided by 10. The cause for this regularity
        is unknown. The empty spot in this progression (between Mars and
        Jupiter) is occupied by asteroids. The Kemerovo physicist V. Iu.
        Kaznev thinks that the regularity is determined by the CSE
        generated by the sun. He has proposed that the matter of planets
        was grouped in the areas of the sun's field force concentration.
      </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyday CSE</i> --- Perceivable waves of
        matter are emanated by piles of pipes, some caves, underground
        tunnels and tree crowns. The shape of premises is also
        significant (round, angular, cupolaed). The wall and furniture
        material also emanates CSE of certain parameters. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Micro CSE ---</i> The CSE effect may be
        manifested not just on galactic or household scales, but also in
        micro-world in substances whose molecules have cavities of
        certain shapes, for example in naphthalene. I had filled a
        one-liter jar with it, sealed it and suspended it from the
        ceiling. People felt a whole system of power field "clots"
        beneath the jar with their palms and even more so if the
        container was suspended above the head. Activated charcoal is
        also a multi-cavity structure. Hold 2-3 tablets of activated
        charcoal in your fingers as demonstrated in the picture and move
        your hands slightly up and down, or alternately part and join
        them for a few minutes. Write to me about the results. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tefilin</i> --- I have isolated 4 CSE
        emitters beneficial to humans so far. Thery are bee honeycombs,
        a grid of joined hands (more about it in the next chapter), a
        sieve, an amulet otherwise known as tefelin. What is tefelin? It
        is an old Jewish device. It is a tightly sown leather cube
        attached to a leather platform with two bands. There are four
        tightly rolled and bleached, soft kidskin strips of parchment
        with Talmudic inscriptions carved into the cube. A worshipper
        attached the device to his forehead, with the axes of parchment
        rolls perpendicular to the forehead and their outer ends facing
        East. It turns out that the inscriptions are irrelevant. What
        matters is the material and its shape and dimensions. When the
        device is made from different materials it causes only
        unpleasant sensations, while a leather tefelin produces a
        beneficial physiological effect. The microstructure of the
        material must have a part in the CSE quality as well, besides
        the shape and other such factors. nepriyatnye oschuscheniya;

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scepter of Thoth</i> --- The ancient
        Egyptian deity Thoth was a god of science, sorcery and an
        "accountant" of the soul's earthly deeds. This is the design of
        his staff. A 2- or 3mm thick copper wire is twisted at the end
        into the shape of a flat spiral, with 3-4 coils 10 cm in
        diameter. It has also 2 coils of transverse, 3-dimensional
        spiral, each 5 cm in diameter, closer to the handle. The wire is
        inserted into the 16 cm long, square-sectioned handle made from
        dense wood. The handle is 4 cm thick at base and 1.5 cm thick at
        its wire end. The entire staff with the wire coil is 41 cm long.
        The narrow end of the handle has 13 deep bellow shaped notches.
        The staff works even without the wire (albeit not as intensely).
        The wire is thin and could be of any material. But, it works the
        best when it is thickly insulated in two layers. This increases
        its effect. If you hold the staff as demonstrated in the
        picture, the total radiation emanating from the center of the
        large spiral, perpendicular to its surface, are very
        well-perceivable by the human palm on both sides of the spiral.
        I have never found out the purpose behind this ancient Egyptian
        tool and what use they may have had for this "double-beam"
        emanator. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheops Pyramid</i> --- Make a pyramid of
        3-4 layers of thick, porous wrapping paper: 20x20 cm square
        base, ascending edges 19cm each. Glue it only at the edges, the
        tighter the better but, in a thin line. Cut out Make a 5-6 cm
        hole in the middle of one of the side faces. Hold a 10 cm long
        piece of drawing coal or a pencil in your fingers and insert
        this indicator into the hole, slanting its far end toward the
        bottom of the pyramid. "Stir" the space inside the pyramid with
        the indicator, take it out and repeat the procedure about 30
        times. You will soon pick up an active zone, a "clot", where the
        Egyptians had their tombs. Another active zone (a flame) above
        the top of the pyramid is also well-perceived by the indicator
        if you drag its end over the top. The "clot" and the "flame" are
        well-felt by the finger inserted into he pyramid, or your palm
        moved above it after some practice. The pyramid effect, which
        generated many scary and mysterious stories over the centuries,
        is one of the CSE manifestations. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Skeleton Pyramid</i> --- Similar
        interesting qualities are displayed by pyramids of identical
        dimensions but only skeletal, without faces. Such a skeleton can
        be glued together from 8 smooth, firm straws. Here we get the
        effect of the total CSE of the straws with their complex
        capillary structure and the effect of the entire cavity. Such
        pyramids can also be made in other sizes with proportional
        increase in the length of the edges. Hold such a pyramid above
        your friend's head, first bottom down for about 5 min, then
        bottom up. Conduct additional experiments with insects
        (bumblebees, developing caterpillars, etc.), house plants and
        perishable foods, by placing the latter within the pyramid,
        above and underneath it (always checking your experiments by
        identical ones but without the CSE effect). You will see that
        ancient Egyptians had their reason to build pyramids. </p>

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Telekinesis</i> --- Is the name for a
        contactless movement of light objects performed by the so-called
        gifted, i. e. moving a match box on a table without touching it,
        or holding a tennis ball in the mid air. I submit that everyone
        has this capability. Suspend the described skeletal straw
        pyramid by its top from the ceiling by a thin, artificial
        thread, or even better yet by a long shred of elastic torn from
        a stocking. Choose a spot with the least convection (air
        circulation). Allow a few hours for the pyramid to stop
        rotating. Cup your hands into a tube (see picture) and point
        your hands from a 2-meter distance at the suspended pyramid (do
        not lose your "target"). The pyramid will eventually start
        rotating clockwise in a few minutes under the pressure of this
        beam of CSE energy. You can then stop its rotation by moving the
        "tube" of your hands to the right side of the skeleton and it
        will start rotating counter-clockwise. Conduct these experiments
        of various duration, after various time intervals and at various
        distances. You will see that telekinesis is no miracle, but only
        one of the manifestations of the will of matter, which is not
        available to only a chosen few but, to everyone. Your palm is
        also a multi-cavity structure, which clearly repels the pyramid
        indicator device described in this chapter. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice using this skeletal pyramid

        repel the straw indicator of this device through any screens
        even harder than some honeycombs. This effect is produced by

      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haymaking with miracles</i> --- I had
        been shown the following trick in my youth. A fragment of a cut
        stem, the length of a short pencil, was placed on the blade of a
        scythe next to its blunt edge. Another such stem fragment of the
        same length was placed on the blade in the same manner but at
        some distance and then it was pushed by hand toward the first
        one. When at about 8cm, the first stem begun to move away from
        the second stem along the edge. This experiment wasn't always
        successful, but it usually occurred immediately after cutting of
        large amount of grass from the same place. I forgot some
        elements or conditions of the experiment but, I think that the
        following factors were at work here. An abrupt change of the
        total CSE field on the "deformed" meadow (let us remember the
        tree windfall case), the grid of the harvester's fingers, the
        multi-cavity properties of the stem itself and perhaps its
        position against the morning sun. Static electricity is excluded
        because everything at that hour is wet. [grass used to be mowed
        with the morning dew still on it]. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identified Flying Objects</i> --- I was
        surprised a long time ago in a remote Caucasus village that
        people would walk about and through dense forests in the
        mountains at night, with lit cigarettes in their mouths and
        waving hands. The light from the buts would light up for a
        second, then disappear behind their bodies or trees flickering
        in the distance. It had turned out that these were actually
        local fireflies, <i>Luceola mingredica</i>. The light of these
        flies twinkles in this manner. Meanwhile, UFO reports and
        letters from my readers speak of dark flying saucers, which turn
        out to be either flocks of birds, or compact swarms of insects.
        I myself have seen not only "columns" of insects in Siberia but,
        also "balls" of them, 3 to 4 meters in diameter. In some cases
        they were some mosquito-like fliers, in others the winged ants
        of the Mirmica genus. Such swarm could be taken by an ignorant
        person for a huge, round plasmoid from afar. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A detailed description of the CSE effect may
        be found in my book "<i>The Mysteries of the World of Insects</i>"
        (Novosibirsk, 1990), in the journals <i>Sibirskii Vestnik
          Selskokhoziastvennoi Nauki</i>, no.3, 1984 and <i>Pchlovodstvo</i>,
        no. 12, 1984. The physical nature of CSE is described in
        "Non-Periodic Galloping Phenomena" in the <i>Environment</i>,
        vol. III (Tomsk, 1988). All in all, I have published over three
        dozens of articles on the CSE. As promised, I will describe the
        rest in my next book. I will call it as I called this chapter:
        "Flight." </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * I have editted the original translation as

        I am asking the English natives for merci for its ethnic

        has been so kind as to allow me to publish this translation for

        contains internal inconsistencies, particularly in the part
        which describes the flying. This may be due to author's intent,
