<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">This chapter deals with the mirrors and lenses 
which are required to be installed in the vimaana. They are seven 
different ones. Their names are</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 23</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">given by Lalla in "Mukura-kalpa" as 
Vishwakriyaadarpana, or television mirror, Shaktyaakarshana darpana or 
power-capturing mirror, Vyroopya darpana or appearance changing mirror, 
Kuntinee darpana, Pinjulaa darpana, Guhaagarbha darpana, and Rowdree 
darpana or terrifying darpana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vishwakriyaa darpana is to be fixed on a revolving
 stand near the pilot so that he could observe whatever is happening 
outside on all sides. Its manufacture is thus described in Kriyaasaara:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Two parts of satva, 2 parts of shundilaka, one 
part of eagle bone, 5 parts of mercury, 2 parts of the foot-nails of 
sinchoranee, 6 parts of mica, 5 parts of red lead, 8 parts of pearl 
dust, 18 parts of the eyeballs of sowmyaka fish, one part burning coal, 8
 parts of snake's slough, 3 parts of eye pigment, 6 parts of maatrunna, 
10 parts of granite sand, 8 parts of salts, 4 of lead, 2 parts of sea 
foam, 3 parts of white throated eagle's skin, 7 parts of bamboo salt, 5 
parts of vyraajya or white keg tree bark, these ingredients should be 
purified, and weighed, and filled in a beaked crucible and placed in the
 furnace called chandodara and subjected to a 800 degree heat, and when 
duly liquified, should be poured into the funnel of the kara-darpana 
yantra or hand-mirror mould. The result will be an excellent mirror in 
which will be reproduced minute details of the phenomena outside.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Shaktyaakarshana darpana:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">As the vimaana flies through the regions of the 
sky, three classes of destructive forces tend to overcome it. This 
mirror is capable of neutralising and overcoming their effects.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Dhundinaathaachaarya also says: The wind, solar 
rays, and fire are known as trivargas. Each of the three has 122 evil 
effects on the plane's pilot. Those evil forces this mirror will absorb 
and nullify.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Paraankusha also says: There are certain crucial 
regions in the air routes of the vimaana, at which the wind, solar heat 
and fire have 366 malefic influences, and shaktyaakarshana mirror is 
meant to safeguard against them. It is to be prepared as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">5 parts of haritaala or yellow orpiment, 5 parts 
of virinchi, 8 parts of salts, 4 parts of gingelly husk, 6 parts of 
diamond, 1 of red mica, 8 parts of burning coal, 3 parts of sand, 2 
parts of tortoise egg, 3 parts of bhaarani, 3 parts of kanda, 5 parts of
 powshkala, 5 of coral, 2 of pearl, 6 of sea-shell,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 24</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font>
 8 of borax, 3 parts of Bengal quince seed, and 5 of shankha or conch, 
cleaned, powdered, filled in swan crucible, placed in mandooka furnace 
and boiled to 500 degrees and poured slowly into vistritaa-mirror yantra
 will yield a fine shaktyaakarshana mirror.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Vyroopya--darpana Mirror:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When enemy planes with men intent on intercepting 
and destroying your vimaana attack you with all the means at their 
disposal, the viroopya-darpana will frighten them into retreat or render
 them unconscious and leave you free to destroy or rout them. The 
darpana, like a magician, will change the appearance of your vimaana 
into such frightening shapes that the attacker will be dismayed or 
paralysed. There are 27 such different shapes that are said to be 
possible. Sammohana-kriyaa-kaanda, or the work dealing with the methods 
causing insensibility, mentions 17 of them. They are fire, water, wind, 
thunder, lightning, fumes, scorpion, bear, lion, tiger, and giant-sized 
frightful birds.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The manufacture of this mirror is thus given in Darpana-prakarana:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">5 parts of bone salt, 3 parts zinc, 3 of lac, 8 of
 iron, 3 parts of shashabola, 2 of raajakurantika, 8 parts of charcoal 
ashes, 3 of borax, 8 parts of nakhaa, 7 of sand, 6 of matrunna, 2 of 
sun-crystal, 3 parts of poora or lime, 25 of mercury, 3 of yellow 
orpiment, 4 parts of silver, 6 of kravyaada, 8 of garada, 3 of pishta, 4
 parts of arshoghna root, 3 parts of vaaraaha pittha, 3 of ammonium 
chloride, 25 of liquorice oil, taking these and 7 times purifying, 
filling in crucible, and placing in furnace and boiling it to 800 
degrees and pouring into Darpanaasya yantra, will yield an excellent 
Vyraajaka mirror.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Kuntinee Mirror:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">We now consider the Kuntinee mirror. The wise say 
that the mirror by the glare of whose rays people's minds get deranged 
is Kuntinee mirror. Paraankusha says that in the region of the solar 
electric heat waves of the sky, seven streams of poisonous whirl-winds 
derange the mind. Scientists have discovered the Kuntinee mirror as a 
protection
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#6"><font color="#0000DE">against</font></a> that evil effect.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In "Sammohana-kriyaa-kaanda," the evil forces are described as follows:</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 25</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Fat, blood, flesh, marrow, bone, skin, 
intelligence are adversely affected by the evil wind currents known as 
gaalinee, kuntinee, kaalee, pinjulaa, ulbanaa, maraa, in the electric 
heat wave regions of the upper sky.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The manufacture of this mirror is thus explained in "Darpana-prakarana":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">5 parts of sowraashtra earth, 7 parts of snake's 
slough, 3 of sea-foam, 5 of shanmukha seeds, 8 of zinc, 3 parts of 
rhinoceros' nails, 8 of salts, 7 of sand, 8 of mercury, 4 of conch, 6 
parts of matrunna, 3 parts of yellow orpiment, 4 of elephant and camel 
salts, 7 parts of suranghrikaa, 5 of gingelly oil, 8 of pearl-shells, 3 
of sea-shells, 4 parts of camphor, purified and filled in shinjikaa 
crucible, and placed in shinjeera furnace and boiled to 700 degrees, the
 fluid poured into the Darpanaasya yantra, will form into a morning 
sun-like kuntinee mirror.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Pinjulaa mirror:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The conflicting inter-action of the solar rays is 
called pinjulaa. It has deleterious effect on the black eye-balls of the
 pilots. The pinjulaa mirror, by intervening will prevent the eye-balls 
being blinded by the evil rays.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in "Amsubodhinee", or the work on solar
 rays, "There are four directions, east, west, north and south, and four
 corner directions, south-east, south-west, north-east and north-west. 
The solar force of each direction has got its own intensity, owing to 
different fire-force, different seasonal force, the effect of the five 
winds, combined with the vaarunee or liquid force of the clouds, and the
 resulting tension gives rise to four evil forces, andha, andhakaara, 
pinjoosha, and taarapaa, whose glows, known as rakta, jaathara, 
taaraagra, and prabha, striking the eye-balls result in blindness of 
both eyes. "</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The manufacture of this mirror is thus described in "Darpana prakarana":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">6 parts of goat's milk, 5 parts of red-lead, 8 
parts of salts, 7 parts of sand, 5 parts of tree-gum, 8 parts of borax, 2
 parts of dambholi essence, 8 parts of mercury, 2 parts of copper and 2 
of lead, 4 parts of surolika essence, 8 parts of twak, 3 parts of 
vaardhyushika, 3 of kanda, 4 parts of pishta or gingelly husk, 3 parts 
of orpiment, 7 parts of Tinnevelli senna, 4 parts of vrikodaree seeds, 
these 18 to be purified, powdered, and filled in crucible, and placed in
 furnace and boiled to 700 degrees, and poured into Darpana yantra, will
 yield an excellent pinjulaa mirror.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 26</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Guhaa-garbha darpana:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The conflict between the electricity in the 
clouds, wind, and rays, generates forces harmful to pilots. The 
guhaa-garbha darpana, by attracting them and projecting them by electric
 force against enemy planes, renders the persons inside them physically 
disabled and incapable of fighting."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Prapanchasaara" also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"In the Middle of the two shells above kashyapa, 
there is vaarunee force. Between the shell and vaarunee force 5000 wind 
currents subsist. Similarly there are disease causing rays numbering 80 
millions. The various winds and rays by mutual action result in flows 
and counter flows. When the cloud force, wind force, and solar force 
interplay they give rise to various harmful forces like bubbles:"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Lallaacharya also avers, "In accordance with the 
110th principle, when the cloud-power, wind-power and sun-power meet 
with force and collide, they produce poisonous effects which are 
dangerous to mankind."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vasishtha says in "Swatassiddha-Nyaaya" or 
"self-evident truth", that when alien forces cross one another, a 
poisonous flow will result naturally as an egg comes out of a tortoise.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Sammohana kriyaa-kaanda" explains:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"By the conflict of cloud force, wind force and 
solar forces, 305105 poisonous waves known as guha and others emanate, 
and cause, kushtha, apasmaara, grihinee, khaasa, and shoola. Chief among
 them are five, known as gridhnee, godhaa, kunjaa, roudree, and guhaa. 
By accelerating them and directing them against the enemy, the 
guhaa-garbha mirror disables them."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Darpana prakarana " describes its manufacture thus:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">7 parts of couries, 3 parts of manjula or madder 
root, 6 parts of sea-foam, 8 parts of ranjaka or phosphorous, 6 parts of
 mandoora or rust, 8 parts of mercury, 3 parts of orpiment, 7 parts of 
brahmika, 2 parts of lead, 8 parts of eye pigment, 6 parts of matrunnna,
 8 parts of sand, 6 parts of kishora, 5 of muchukunda, 2 parts of 
gingelly oil, 25 of lohika, 5 parts of mridaani garbha essence, 8 of 
sowraashtra earth, 5 parts of sphatika, 3 of bones, 15 of indusatva or 
moonstone?, and 5 of dambholi taakaa dwaya satva,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 27</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">taking these 22, purifying and powdering them and 
filling crucible, and placing in furnace and boiling to 700 degrees, and
 cooled in yantra, guhaa garbha darpana is produced.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Rowdree-darpana is a mirror or lens which liquefies everything that it flashes against.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Paraankusha says that where Rudraanyosharaa and 
abhralinga come into contact, a fierce force called roudree comes into 
being. Mingling with solar rays it melts everything. "Sammohana kriyaa 
kaanda" says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"By the mixing of roudree and solar rays an evil 
force called maarikaa is generated, and impelled by the solar 
electricity, it destroys the enemy planes."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Darpanaa prakarana describes its manufacture:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">8 parts of lead, 3 parts of shaalmali, 7 of 
durvaara, 8 parts kudupinjara, 21 parts of droonee, 8 parts sun-crystal,
 27 parts of rudraanee-graavoshara, 6 parts betel leaves, 8 parts of 
kowtila, 30 of veeraabhra linga, 8 parts of salts, 7 of sand, 6 parts of
 matrunna, 3 of dimbhika, 8 of zinc, 13 of ant-hill earth, 6 of gum, 3 
of kumbhinee, 3 parts sweet oil, 27 of Tinnevelly senna, 6 of godhaamla,
 8 of silk cotton, 8 parts of virinchi satva, 5 parts of kanda, 3 parts 
of yellow orpimet, 7 parts of kaarmukha, or brown barked acacia?, these 
26, powdered, purified, and filled in crucible and placed in furnace and
 boiled to 800 degrees, and poured into Darpana yantra, will yield a 
fine roudrikaa-uarpana.</font></p>
