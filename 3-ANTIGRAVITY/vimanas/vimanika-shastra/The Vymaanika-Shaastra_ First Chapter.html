<font face="Arial" size="5">FIRST CHAPTER</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">I make obeisance to the Divine Being, who is 
visible on the crest of the Vedas, who is the fountain of eternal bliss,
 and whose abode is reached by Vimaanas or Aeroplanes. Having studied 
the Shaastraas or sciences propounded by previous men of science to the 
best of my ability, for the benefit of mankind, I shall deal with the 
science of Aeronautics, which is the essence of the Vedas, which will be
 a source of joy and benefit to humanity, which will facilitate 
comfortable travel in the sky from world to world, in eight chapters, 
consisting of 100 topics, in 500 sutras or cryptic pronouncements.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Commentary by Bodhaananda:</b></font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">I bow to God Mahadeva and His Consort, to 
Saraswathi Goddess of learning, to Ganapathy guardian of benevolent 
efforts, and to my venerable preceptor, and I bow to Maharshi 
Bharadwaaja. In Addition to my own knowledge of Logic, I have five times
 turned over Vaalmeeki's Mathematics, 'Paribhaashaa Chandrikaa,' and 
'Naamaarthhakalpaka,' and aided by their authority, I, Swaamy 
Bodhaananda, for the easy understanding of the young, have written this 
'Bodhananda Vritti,' to elucidate Maharshi Bharadwaaja's concisely 
worded text on Aeronautics.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">At the outset Maharshi Bharadwaaja invokes God in 
the traditional manner for the successful commencement, progress, and 
completion of his great literary work. Attaining mastery over the Vedas 
by Divine Grace, and studying the works of earlier Aachaaryaas or 
preceptors, he has churned the Vedic lore, and extracting the, cream, 
presented it to mankind for reaping untold benefits, in the work named 
'Yantrasarvasva.' In the fortieth chapter therein he deals with the 
science of Aeronautics, explaining the construction and use of many 
kinds of aeroplanes, in 8 chapters, containing 100 subject heads, 
comprising 500 sutras or oracular pronouncements.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 2</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the first stanza the reference is to the 
teaching of the sacred works, "Uttara-taapaneeya," 'Shaibya-prasna,' 
'Kaataka,' and 'Maandookya,' that the symbolic letter, 'Om,' leads to 
the knowledge of God and Salvation. Bharadwaaja implies that the Vimaana
 or aeroplane constructed according to Vymaanika Shaastra, may enable 
men to reach God, and enjoy the benefits of His Divine abode.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The previous Aachaaryaas Bharadwaaja refers to are
 named by Vishwanaatha as,--Naaraayana, Shownaka, Garga, Vaachaspathi, 
Chaakraayani and Dhundinaatha, venerable authors of 
"Vimaana-Chandrikaa", "Vyomayaana-Tantra," "Yantra-Kalpa", 
"Yaana-Bindu," "Kheta-yaana Pradeepikaa," and 
"Vyomayaana-Arkaprakaasha," respectively.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bharadwaaja thus defines the word Vimaana:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>Vega-Saamyaat Vimaano Andajaanaam. Sootra 1</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"Owing to similarity of speed with birds, it is named Vimaana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The word "andaja" means "egg-born", and includes 
eagles and other birds which fly by their own volition. The Vimaana is a
 vehicle which flies in the sky with speed comparable with birds.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Lallachaarya says, "That which can fly in the sky with speed equal to that of birds, is called Vimaana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Aachaarya Naaraayana says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"That which can speed on earth, on water, through air, by its own power, like a bird, is a "Vimaana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Shankha says, "Experts in the science of 
aeronautics say, "That which can fly through air from one place to 
another is a Vimaana"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">And Vishwambhara says, "Experts say that that 
which can fly through air from one country to another country, from one 
island to another island, and from one world to another world, is a 
"Vimaana"."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having thus defined the name of the Vimaana, the sage proceeds to describe its details.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>Rahasyagnyodhikaaree. Sootra 2</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"The pilot is one who knows the secrets."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda: Scientists say that there are 32 
secrets of the working of the Vimaana. A pilot should acquaint himself 
thoroughly with them before</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 3</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">he can be deemed competent to handle the 
aeroplane. He must know the structure of the aeroplane, know the means 
of its take off and ascent to the sky, know how to drive it and how to 
halt it when necessary, how to manoeuvre it and make it perform 
spectacular feats in the sky without crashing. Those secrets are given 
in "Rahasya-Lahari" and other works, by Lalla and other masters, and are
 described thus:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The pilot should have had training in maantrica 
and taantrica, kritaka and antaraalaka, goodha or hidden, drishya and 
adrishya or seen and unseen, paroksha and aparoksha, contraction and 
expansion, changing shape, look frightening, look pleasing, become 
luminous or enveloped in darkness, deluge or pralaya, vimukha, taara, 
stun by thunderous din, jump, move zig-zag like serpent, chaapala, face 
all sides, hear distant sounds, take pictures, know enemy manoeuvres, 
know direction of enemy approach, stabdhaka or paralyse, and karshana or
 exercise magnetic pull.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">These 32 secrets the pilot should learn from 
competent preceptors, and only such a person is fit to be entrusted with
 an aeroplane, and not others.</font></p>  
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">They are explained thus by <u>Siddhanaatha</u>:</font></p>  
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>1. Maantrika</b>; As prescribed in 
"Mantraadhikaara," by invoking the mantras of Chhinnamasta, Bhairavee, 
Veginee, Siddhaamba, acquire the powers of ghutikaa, paadukaa, visible 
and invisible and other mantraas with potent herbs and efficacious oils,
 and Bhuvaneswaree Mantra which confers spiritual and mesmeric powers, 
to construct aeroplanes, which don't break cannot be cut, cannot be 
burnt, and cannot be destroyed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>2. Taantrika</b>: By acquiring Mahaamaaya, Shambara, and other taantric powers, to endow the plane with those powers.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>3. Kritaka</b>: By study of architects like Vishwakarma, Chhaayaaparusha, Mann, Maya and others, to construct aeroplanes of various patterns.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>4. Antaraala</b>: In the wind-swept 
atmospheric region of the sky, in the clash at the borders of mighty 
currents, an inadvertent plane is likely to be smashed to pieces. But by
 getting warned of the approach of such danger spots, the plane could be
 halted and steered with care.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>5. Goodha</b>: As explained in 
'Vaayutatva-Prakarana', by harnessing the powers, Yaasaa, Viyaasaa, 
Prayaasaa in the 8th atmospheric layer covering the earth, to attract 
the dark content of the solar ray, and use it to hide the Vimaana from 
the enemy.</font></p>
	<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 4</font></a></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>6. Drishya</b>: By collision of the electric 
power and wind power in the atmosphere, a glow is created, whose 
reflection is to be caught in the Vishwa-Kriyaa-darapana or mirror at 
the front of the Vimana, and by its manipulation produce a Maaya-Vimaana
 or camouflaged Vimana.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>7. Adrishya</b>: According to "Shaktitantra", 
by means of the Vynarathya Vikarana and other powers in the heart centre
 of the solar mass, attract the force of the ethereal flow in the sky, 
and mingle it with the balaahaavikarana shakti in the aerial globe, 
producing thereby a white cover, which will make the Vimana invisible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>8. Paroksha</b>: According to 
"Meghotpatthi-prakarana," or the science of the birth of clouds, by 
entering the second of the summer cloud layers, and attracting the power
 therein with the shaktyaakarshana darpana or force-attraction mirror in
 the Vimana, and applying it to the parivesha or halo of the Vimaana, a 
paralysing force is generated, and opposing Vimaanas are paralysed and 
put out of action.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>9. Aparoksha</b>: According to 'Shakti-tantra,' by projection of the Rohinee beam of light, things in front of the Vimaana are made visible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>10. Sankocha, or Contraction</b>: As 
prescribed in the Yantraangopasamhaara section, when the Vimaana is 
flying at speed with fully extended wings, and there is danger ahead, 
turning the 7th switch in the Vimana, its parts can be made to contract.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>11. Vistrita</b>: According to 
'Akaashatantra', when the Vimana is in the central air flood in the 
third and first regions of the sky, by turning the switch in the 11th 
section of plane, it becomes expanded suitably according to "Vaalmeeki 
Ganita."</font></p>

oil-smeared Vyroopya-darpana at the top of the Vimaana, and whirling 
with 132nd type of speed, a very fierce and terrifying shape of the 
Vimana will emerge, causing utter fright to onlookers.</font></p>

"Amshubodhinee," out of Samgnaana and other 16 digits of the solar glow,
 by attracting the 12th to the 16th digits and focusing them on the air 
force in the Mayookha section in the fourth pathway in the sky, and 
similarly by attracting the force of the etherial glow and mingling it 
with the glow in the 7th layer of air mass, and then by projecting both 
these forces through the 5 tubes in the Vimana on to the section of the 
guhaa-garbha mirror, a rich glow like the morning glow of the sun will 
be produced.</font></p>

din, which stuns people, and makes them quake with fear and become 
insensible.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><b>21. Langhana</b>: As stated in "Vaayu tattva 
prakarana" When crossing from one air stream into another, the Vimana 
faces the baadaba glow of the sun and catches fire. In order to prevent 
that, the electric force and air force in the Vimana should be conjoined
 and centred in the life-centre of the Vimana, and by turning the 
switch, the Vimana will leap into safety.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The sootra defines the clothing which is to be 
provided to the pilot in accordance with different seasonal conditions. 
The impact of the sun's myriad rays on the revolving earth causes 
seasonal climatic changes. Their effects on human life are either 
wholesome or unwholesome, as the case may be. The latter cause cramps, 
drain blood, and denude the body of fat, flesh, and other ingredients. 
The evil forces of the seasons are reckoned as 25, and affect the skin, 
bone, flesh, fat, muscles, nerves, joints and other parts of the pilots'
 body. The clothing provided to them should be such as to safeguard 
against such effects, and maintain their efficiency.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Pata-samskaara Ratnaakara", silk, 
cotton, moss, hair, mica, leather, are to be purified by 25 processes, 
washed with mica-saturated water, and spun into yarn as prescribed by 
Gaalava. Then fibres from the ketaki flower palm, arka or swallow wort 
or madar, sun flower tree, cocoanut and jute, should each be purified 8 
times as prescribed and by 19 processes, spun into yarn, and woven into 
cloth. Then the cloth should be soaked in the oils of linseed, tulasi or
 basil, goose-berry, shamee or acacia suma, bael, and mustard, and dried
 in the sun 5 times daily for 7 days. Then yellow ochre, lac, tamarind,

the seventh region, at the sineevaalee and kuhoo yogas or full-moon and 
new-moon conjunctions, produce maleficent and beneficent effects. The 
beneficent forces are 7,58,00,700 in number, and the maleficent forces 
also are of the same number, according to "Vaalmeeki Ganita". The 
beneficent effects are during the full moon period, and the maleficent 
effects during the new-moon period. 25 maleficent poisonous forces known
 as Bhedinee, tend to paralyse the pilots' physical effeciency. That is
