<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Shaktyadhikaranam: The Power.</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>"Shaktayassapta" Sootra 1</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"The power sources are seven."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In this chapter the motive power of the vimaana is
 explained. In the functioning of the vimaana, there are 7 distinct 
operating forces. They are named udgamaa, panjaraa, 
sooryashaktyapa-karshinee or that which extracts solar power, 
parashaktyaakarshinee or that which extracts opposite forces, a set of 
12 shaktis or forces, kuntinee, and moolashakti or primary force. At set
 spots in the vimaana, the motors which produce these 7 powers should be
 installed, duly wired and equipped with springs and wheels, as 
prescribed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in "Yantra-sarvasva:"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The seven kinds of powers which are required for 
the Vimaana are produced by 7 motors which are named tundila, panjara, 
amshupa, apakarshaka, saandhaanika, daarpanika, and shaktiprasavaka. 
Each of these produces its specific power. Thus tundilaa produces 
udgamaa shakti, panjaraa produces the panjaraa shakti, shaktipaa 
produces the power which sucks solar power, apakarshaka produces the 
power which plucks the power of alien planes, sandhaana yantra produces 
the group of 12 forces, daarpanikaa produces kuntinee shakti, and 
shakti-prasava yantra produces the main motive power.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Shownaka-sootra also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"There are seven sources of power of the vimaana: 
fire, earth, air, sun, moon, water and sky. The seven kinds of powers 
are named udgamaa, panjaraa, solar heat absorber, alien force absorber, 
solar electric dozen, kuntinee, and primary force."</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 29</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Soudaaminee-kalaa" says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Ma, la, ya, ra, sa, va, na constitute the seven 
vimanic forces. Ma is udgamaa, la is panjaraa, ya is solar heat 
absorber, ra is the solar dozen, sa is alien force absorber, va is 
kuntinee, and na is primary force.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Their actions are thus defined in "Kriyaa-saara":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The ascent of the vimana is by udgamaa shakti. 
Its descent is by panjaraa-shakti. Solar heat absorbing is by 
shaktyapakarshinee. Alien force restraining is by parashakty snatcher. 
Spectacular motion of the vimaana is by the vidyud-dwaadashaka-shakti. 
All these various activities are by the prime force of the vimana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vidyuddwaadashaka is thus explained in "Soudaaminee-kalaa":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The spectacular motions of the vimaana are of 12 
kinds. Their motive forces are also 12. The motions and the forces are, 
proceeding, shuddering, mounting, descending, circling, speeding, 
circumambulating, side-wise motion, receding, anti-clockwise motion, 
remaining motionless, and performing miscellaneous motions."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>"Shaktayah-pancha -iti-Narayanaha." Sootra 2</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"Narayana holds that the forces are five only, and not twelve."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Five forces are generated by the yantra or dynamo called Sadyojaata, and they produce all the spectacular motions of the vimana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says "Shakti sarvasva":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The motions of a vimaana are five, Chaalana, Gaalana, Panjaraprerana, Vakraapasarpana, and Spectacular manoeuvring."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>"Chitrinyeveti sphotaayanah." Sootra 3</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Sphotaayana holds that chitrinee is the sole shakti.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Sphotaayana declares that the force called 
chitrinee shakti is the one which enables the vimana to perform 
spectacular manoeuvres.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 30</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font>
 "Shakti-sarvasva" says that both from experience and scientific 
knowledge Sphotaayana propounds the view that 32 various kinds of 
motions of the vimaana are solely by the power of Chitrinee-shakti.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Kriyaa-saara " also states that Chitrinee force 
of the 17th quality is solely responsible for the 32 types of 
aeronautical motions.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>"Tadantarbhaaavaat Saptaiveti" Sootra 4</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"The shaktis are 7 only, and include all others"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Out of the five forces produced by the sadyojaata 
mechanism, panjaraa shakti is the most important. The other shaktis are 
incidental to it, just as sparks are incidental to fire. Chaalana and 
other motions may therefore be said to result from panjaraa shakti.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says "Shaktibeeja": "It is by the panjaraa shakti 
generated by sadyojaata yantra that the chalana and other shaktis branch
 out. "</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Shakti kousthubha" also says, "From the panjaraa shakti produced by sadyojaata, emanate the chaalama and other 4 shaktis."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Thus since the other shaktis branch out from 
panjaraa shakti, they may be said to be in essence identical with it. 
That panjaraa and chitrinee are included in the seven shaktis which have
 been enumerated by Maharshi Bharadwaaja. Hence there cannot be said to 
be any conflict of opinions. Some even hold the view that each one of 
the seven shaktis is capable of producing all the 32 motions of the 
vimaana. But since each of the several motions of the plane is 
definitely ascribed to a particular kind of force, it would be incorrect
 to hold that one force could be responsible for the whole gamut of 
motions. Any attempt to give practical effect to such a theory would 
prove disastrous. Therefore the right conclusion is that the seven 
forces are the true cause of the 32 kinds of aerial activities of the 
vimaana.</font></p>
