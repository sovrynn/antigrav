<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having described the forces or energies required 
for the various functions of the vimaana, now the mechanisms necessary 
for these activities are described.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Kriyaa-saara" says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"As stated by the eminent Bharadwaaja in 
"Yantrasarvasva", the mechanical equipments necessary for the vimaana 
are 32. They are vishwakriyaadarsa or universal reflecting mirror,

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Prepare a square or circular base of 9 inches 
width with wood and glass, mark its centre, and from about an inch and 
half thereof draw lines to the edge in the 8 directions, fix 2 hinges in
 each of the lines in order to open and shut. In the centre erect a 6 
inch pivot and four tubes, made of vishvodara metal, equipped with 
hinges and bands of iron, copper, brass or lead, and attach to the pegs 
in the lines in the several directions. The whole is to be covered.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Prepare a mirror of perfect finish and fix it to 
the danda or pivot. At the base of the pivot an electric yantra should 
be fixed. Crystal or glass beads should be fixed at the base, middle, 
and end of the pivot or by its side. The circular or goblet shaped 
mirror for attracting solar rays should be fixed at the foot of the 
pivot. To the west of it the image-reflector should be placed. Its 
operation is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First the pivot or pole should be stretched by 
moving the keelee or switch. The observation mirror should be fixed at 
its base. A vessel with mercury should be fixed at its bottom. In it a 
crystal bead with hole should be placed. Through the hole in the 
chemically purified bead, sensitive wires should be passed and attached 
to the end beads in various directions. At the middle of the pole, 
mustard cleaned solar mirror should be fixed. At the foot of the pole a 
vessel should be placed with liquid ruchaka salt. A crystal should be 
fixed in it with hinge and wiring. In the bottom centre should be placed
 a goblet-like circular mirror for attracting solar rays. To the west of
 it a reflecting mechanism should be placed. To the east of the liquid 
salt vessel, the electric generator should be placed and the wiring of 
the crystal attached to it. The current from both the yantras should be 
passed to the crystal in the liquid ruchaka salt vessel. Eight parts of 
sun-power in the solar reflector and 12 parts of electric power should 
be passed through the crystal into the mercury and on to the universal 
reflecting mirror. And then that mirror should be focussed in the 
direction of the region which has to be photographed. The image which 
appears in the facing lens will then be reflected</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 33</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">through the crystal in the liquid salt solution. 
The picture which will appear in the mirror will be true to life, and 
enable the pilot to realise the conditions of the concerned region, and 
he can take appropriate action to ward off danger and inflict damage on 
the enemy.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Shaktyaakarshana yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Yantra sarvasva" says, "Owing to the etherial 
waves and raging winds of the upper regions in accordance with die 
seasons, evil forces are generated which tend to destroy the vimaana. 
The Shaktyaakarshana yantra in the vimaana is meant to subdue those 
forces and render them harmless."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Narayana also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Three fierce forces arise from the fierce winds 
and ethereal waves, and cruse destruction of the plane. The 
shalayaakarshana yantra by its superior force subdues them and ensures 
safety of the vimaana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Its construction is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The base is to be 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, and
 made of krouncha metal. A 12 inch tall 3 inch wide pole or peg made of 
27th kind of glass should be fixed in its middle. To the east of it, as 
also to the west, 3 centres should be marked on each side. To the north 
and south also 2 centres should be marked on each side. At each centre 
screw-bolts should be fixed. Then tubes made of the 107th glass, with 
cleaned wiring should be fixed. A goblet shaped 15 inch sized glass 
vessel should be fixed on the base of the central peg. A 1 foot circular
 glass ball with three holes should be fixed in the main centre. A 
triangular shaped 1 foot sized mirror made of Aadarsha glass should be 
fixed on the 3rd kendra. Two circular rods made of magnetic metal and 
copper should be fixed on the glass ball so as to cause friction when 
they revolve. To the west of it a globular ball made of vaatapaa glass 
with a wide open mouth should be fixed. Then a vessel made of shaktipaa 
glass, narrow at bottom, round in the middle, with narrow neck, and open
 mouth with 5 beaks should be fixed on the middle bolt. Similarly on the
 end bolt should be placed a vessel with sulphuric acid 
(bhraajaswad-draavaka). On the pegs on southern side 3 interlocked 
wheels should be fixed. On the north side liquefied mixture of 
load-stone, mercury, mica, and serpent-slough should be placed. And 
crystals should be placed at the requisite centres.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 34</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Maniratnaakara" says that the shaktyaakarshana 
yantra should be equipped with 6 crystals known as Bhaaradwaaja, 
Sanjanika, Sourrya, Pingalaka, Shaktipanjaraka, and Pancha-jyotirgarbha.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The same work mentions where the crystals are to 
be located. The sourrya mani is to be placed in the vessel at the foot 
of the central pole, Sanjanika mani should be fixed at the middle of the
 triangular wall. Pingalaka mani is to be fixed in the wide mouthed 
glass globe. Bhaaradwaaja mani should be fixed in the opening in the 
naala-danda. Pancha-jyotirgarbha mani should be fixed in the sulphuric 
acid vessel, and Shakti-panjaraka mani should be placed in the mixture 
of magnet, mercury, mica, and serpent-slough. All the five crystals 
should be equipped with wires passing
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#7"><font color="#0000DE">through</font></a> glass tubes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Wires should be passed from the centre in all 
directions. Then the triple wheels should be set in revolving motion, 
which will cause the two glass balls inside the glass case, to turn with
 increasing speed rubbing each other, the resulting friction generating a
 100 degree power. That power should be conveyed through wires to the 
sanjanika mani. Mingling with the force existing therein, that force 
issues out and should be transmitted through wires to the sourrya mani. 
On contact of the power therein the force will split into 5 streams. 
Each of the five power streams should be connected with one of the 
manis, Bhaaradwaja, Sourrya, Pingala, Pancha-jyotirmani, and 
Shakti-panjara mani. Mingling with the force in each mani, they form 
five forces, which are named by Atri maharshi as Raja, Mourtvica, 
Chundeera, Shoonya, and Garbha-vishodara. These should be passed by 
wires to the sulphuric acid vessel. They then form 3 forces, named 
marthanda, rowhinee, and bhadra. Marthanda shakti should be passed into 
the load-stone, mercury, mica, and serpent slough liquids. The resulting
 current should then be passed through wires to the wide mouthed glass 
globular vessel. Solar force pregnant with etherial force should be 
passed into the Naaladanda, and thence to the vessel with marthanda 
shakti. The power of the solar rays entering that vessel mingles with 
the marthanda shakti inside, and the resultant force has to be focussed 
towards the adverse force of the etherial current which will be thereby 
nullified and the vimaana will be protected.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then the Rohinee shakti should be passed through 
wires into the vessel containing the fivefold load stone, mercury, mica,
 serpent slough acid,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 35</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">and the resulting current passed to the 
Bhrajasvaddraavaka or luminous acid vessel at the foot of the central 
pole. Then from the air-route collect the wind-force impregnated solar 
rays and pass them also into the above vessel. Mingling with the 
rowhinee shakti therein a super-force will be created which should be 
passed through the northern pivot, into the rowhinee power vessel. The 
united force should then he directed against the malefic wind force in 
the air-route, so that it will tame the evil force and protect the 
Vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then from the suragha tube Bhadraa shakti should 
be passed into five fold acid vessel. The resulting force should be 
passed through wired tubes to the foot of the triangular wall, and 
thence to the pivot on the southern side. The force should then be 
directed against the evil roudree Force in the air-route. Neutralising 
that third destructive force in the sky, the vimaana will be allowed 
smooth passage in the sky.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Parivesha-kriya yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to Yantra-sarvasva, by manipulating the 
five forces a halo is formed around the vimaana, and by drawing the 
solar rays into contact with it, the rays will speed the aeroplane along
 the rekhaamaarga or safety line. This is achieved by the operation of 
the above said yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Narayanacharya also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"The mechanism which will manipulate the five 
forces so as to create a halo round the plane, and attracting the solar 
rays and contacting them with the plane, make them draw the plane 
smoothly and speedily along the air route without swerving into danger, 
is called parivesha-kriyaa yantra or halo-forming mechanism."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Soudaaminee kalaa says, "The forces of ksha, ja, la, bha, and ha, when united attract solar rays. "</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Gopatha-kaarika," the forces in 
shireesha or Indra or lightning, clouds, earth, stars; and sky, are 
indicated by the letters ksha, ja, la, bha, and ha. By combining those 
live forces a halo, like that around the solar orb, will be created, and
 it will have the power or attracting solar rays.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kriyaa-saara says Shireesha has 2 parts, Clouds 
have 8 parts, Earth has 5, Stars have 7, and Aakaasha or Sky or Ether 
has 10. The Aakarshana</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 36</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">yantra should attract these forces and unify them.
 Then through the mirror above the vimaana attract solar rays, and apply
 them to the unified forces,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">A halo will be created, and that halo, in 
combination with the solar rays, will draw the plane through a safe 
course like a bird held by a string, Its formation is thus explained in 
Yantra-sarvasva:</font></p>  <h3 align="center">

<h3 align="center">
<font face="Arial" color="#B50400">"Athha Yantraangaani"</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial">We now deal with the parts of the yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">A foot-plate: 23 main centres to be marked on it, 
with lines connecting the centres. Similar number of revolving screws, 
wired tubes, pole with three wheels, eight liquids, eight crystals, 
eight liquid containers, mirror to attract the forces of shireesha, 
cloud, earth, stars, and aakaasha, five electric mechanism, five barks 
of trees, copper coated wires, five leathers, hollow screws, revolving 
screw with wire, vessels for storing the energies, vessel for mixing the
 energies, smoke-spreading yantra, air-fanning yantra, halo-creating 
tube made of milky-leather, solar ray attracting mirror tube, tube for 
collecting the solar rays reflected in the mirror at the top portion of 
the vimaana, crest-crystal, screw for connecting the solar rays to the 
vimaana. These are the 23 parts of halo producing yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Its construction is now explained: A wooden base 
23 feet square, made of black pippala or holy fig tee. 23 centres 
enclosed in a case made of 35th type of glass. 23 lines to the centres. 
Revolving keys to be fixed at the 23 centres. Wired glass tubes should 
connect one centre with another. A glass pole made of the 37th type of 
glass, 5 feet long, 1 foot thick in the middle, 18 inches thick at the 
neck, with a 10 fact wide top, should be fixed as the central pillar, 
with 3 revolving wheels. Eight acids should be placed in the eight 
directions from the north-east side. Their names are rubnaka, kraantaja,
 taarkshya, naaga, gowree, vishandhaya, khadyota and jwalana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The rubnaka acid is to be placed in the north-east
 centre, kraantaja in the centre, naaga at the southern centre, gowree 
at the south-west corner, vishandhaya in the western centre, khadyota at
 the north-west centre, and jwalana at the northern centre in 8 glass 
vessels.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The names of the vessels are also given by 
Shaarikaanaatha: shila, abhra, paara, vyrinchika, vaaluka, 
asuragranthika, sphutika, and pancha-mrith,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 37</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> The 8 vessels are made out of these 8 elements by process defined in "Darpana-prakarana."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The rubnaka acid should be filled in shila-darpana
 vessel; kaarshnya-acid in abhrakaadarsha; kraantaja acid in 
paaraadarsha vessel; naagadraava in vyrinchi-aadarsha vessel; khadyota 
acid in sphutikaadarsha; gowree acid should be filled in vaalukaadarsha 
vessel; vishandhaya acid should be filled in suragrathika vessel; and 
jwalana acid in panchamrid vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the 8 acid filled vessels 8 crystals are to be 
inserted. As mentioned in "Maniprakarana" their names are dhoomaasya, 
ghanagarbha, shalyaaka, shaarika, tushaasya, somaka, shankha, and 
amshupa.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having mentioned their names, we now explain their
 disposal. Dhoomaasya mani is to be placed in rubna acid vessel. 
Ghanagarbha mani should be placed in kraantaja acid vessel. Shalyaaka in
 kaarshni acid vessel. Shaarika in naaga acid vessel. Tushaasya is to be
 placed in gowree acid, Shankha in jwalana acid; Somaka in vishandhaya 
acid; and Amshupa mani is to be placed in khadyota acid vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In front of these manis, eight shaktyaakarshana, 
or energy-imbibing mirrors are to be fixed. Their names according to 
Bharadwaja are taaraasya, pavanaasya, dhoomaasya, vaarunaasya, 
jalagarbha, agnimitra, chaayaasya, and bhanukantaka. Their location is 
as follows: Six inches in front of dhoomasya mani the taaraasya mirror 
with an iron rod with a switch attached to it should be fixed. 
Pavanaasya mirror should be fixed similarly in front of ghanagarbha 
mani. Dhoomaasya mirror should be fixed 6 inches in front of shalyaaka 
mani. Vaarunaasya mirror should be fixed in front of shaarikaa mani. 
Jalagarbha mirror should be fixed in front of somaka mani. Agnimitra 
mirror should be fixed in front of tushaasya mani. Chhayaasya mirror 
should be fixed in front of shankha mani. And Bhanukantaka mirror should
 be fixed in front of amshupaa mani.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then in the western centre should be installed the
 electric generator with switch. Copper-coated wires covered with live 
kinds of skins, should be spread all-round, proceeding from the 
shakti-yantra or electric generator. The names of the five skins, 
according to "Kriyaa-saara," are rhinoceros, tortoise, dog, rat or hare,
 and crocodile.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 38</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Twangnirnaya-adhikaara," or chapter 
on skins, for seats in vimaanas, and, for containing acids, and covering
 wires, five kinds of skins are mentioned by the learned; skins of 
rhinoceros, tortoise, dog, rat or hare, and crocodile. These five are to
 be used for the purposes of cove-ring, and seating. Wires covered with 
these skins are good conductors of electricity. The bhraamanee keela, or
 central revolving pole should be fixed in the centre so that when it 
revolves all the other pivotal centres also revolve. Eight energy 
storing vessels should be placed in the 9th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 15th
 16th and 11th centres. The sammelana vessel or coordinating vessel 
should be placed in the front of the 23rd centre. To the south of it at 
the 21st centre the wind blowing mechanism should be fixed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Vaata-prasaarana or wind-blowing yantra is 
thus described: In the central pivot there are to be 5 wheels which will
 turn with 100 linka revolutions by contact with electric wires: in the 
east and west two bellows on pivots: two air-containers with 3 mouths or
 openings: 6 wheels which prevent air-motion: two tubes with switches 
which will cause spreading: wheels with keys that will induce speed, or 
full speed, slow, very slow or stop, shaped like a tortoise, having two 
bharas or parts?, and having a wheel fixed at the top. That is a 
vaata-prasaarana yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The dhooma-prasaarana yantra or smoke-spreading 
yantra is as follows: with three openings, 5 satchels inside, 8 wheels, 
three keelakas or switches, encircled by electric tube, provided with 
smoke-generating mani or crystal, and equipped with 5 acids, with two 
churning wheels with keys, with two smoke containers attached to the 
bellows tube, with smoke-spreading yantra, and it is to be fixed at the 
20th centre.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The parivesha-kriyaa naala or halo-creating tube 
is thus explained. Out of 5 milks from 5 kinds of milk trees, 6 barks of
 trees, and 2 valkalas (hemp, jute), cloth is fashioned. And that cloth 
should be used in preparing the parivesha-kriya or halo-forming tube.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is stated in "Ksheeree-pata kalpa":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the realm of milk-yielding trees, 
dugdha-pranaalee, patapaadapa, payodharee, panchavatee, and virinchi are
 the 5 most suitable for manufacture of milk-cloth useful for vimaanas.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 39</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Patapradeepikaa" also says, "Among the 
milk-trees, the best for producing milk-cloth are the following five, 
payodharee, panchavatee, viranchi, patapaadapa and dugdhapranaalika.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The six bark-trees are godaakanda, 
kurangaka-niryaasa, aandolikaaviyatsaara, lavika, prishatka, and 
kshmaamala. In conjunction with the milk from milk-trees these barks 
produce cloth which is flawless, strong, and soft.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">For the two valkalas, according to 
"Agatatva-nirnaya" out of 5000 kinds of valkalas from shaarikaa to 
panchamukhee, the two named simhikaa and panchaanga are said to be 
excellent for producing the milk-cloth required for vimaanas.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The composition of the cloth is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Dudgdhapranaalika milk 8 parts, 10 parts of the 
milk juice of the patavriksha, 7 parts of payodaree or cocoanut milk, 18
 parts of the milk of the 5 vata or ficus trees, and 12 parts of 
virancha tree.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The ambikaa-shatka composition is 10 parts of 
godaa-kanda, 17 parts of gum from kurangaka, 15 parts of aandolikaa 
viyatsaara, 12 parts lavika, 20 parts of prishatka, and 15 parts of 
kshmaamala.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The two jute cloth proportions are given in 
"Shana-nirnaya chandrikaa," as 28 parts of simhikaa jute, and 18 parts 
of panchaangavalkala jute.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">These proportions of 5 ksheera or milk, 6 ambika 
or barks, and 2 valkalas or jutes, should be mixed together and unified,
 and boiled in paakaadhaana yantra and churned a number of times, and 
processing with acids 12 times, should be filled in pata-garbha kriya or
 cloth-making yantra, and milk-cloth of excellent quality obtained. The 
parivesha kriyaa-tube made out of this cloth will, by manipulation of 
the concerned switch, expel smoke from the vimaana, and by quick 
advancing and reverse revolutions of the wheel will spread the smoke all
 round so as to envelope the vimaana by means of the smoke-screen.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Kiranaakarsha-Naala:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">16 parts of the 305th variety of glass, 5 parts of
 kaancholikaabharana, 6 parts of nagakesara or merua ferrea,--aletris 
hyacinthoides, 4 parts of</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">couries, sunflower, and Indian spikenard, 8 parts 
of pure borax, iron dross, onion juice, cuscus grass powder, ruby glass,
 the three varieties of salt-petre, sand, essence of suranjikaa, 
viranchi flour, essence of black-mica, essence of bael fruit, and juice 
of flower buds, these twelve ingredients, in the proportion of 27, 5, 7,
 3, 8, 7, 3, 11, 8, and 12, are to be filled in the frog-shaped 
crucible, and placed in the frog-shaped furnace, and melted with 300 
degrees of heat with the help of two-winged bellows. The resulting 
liquid is to be poured into the darpana yantra or glass-making machine, 
so as to produce the kiranaakarshana or rays-attracting yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The tube made of this glass should be fixed at the top of the concerned yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next- the pratibimba-arka-kiranaakarshana naala, or tube for attracting the reflection of the solar says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Naalikaa-nirnaya," the essence of 
squash gourd, juice of momardica, 2 parts, of the salt of the two 
wheeled root vegetable, 3 parts of salt of simhamoola, 122nd type of 
glass, essence of white mica, jelly stone, borax, root of Bengal-madder,
 thorn at the root of bamboo, lead, mercury, these 15 ingredients are to
 be mixed in the proportion of 5, 12, 4, 3, 7, 3, 11, 4, 9, 12, 20, 18, 
12, 5, 20. The mixture should be filled in the crucible known as 
samavargika, and heated in the furnace of the same name, and heated to 
the degree of 315, with the aid of bellows called suraghaa. The 
resulting liquid should be poured into the mirror--making machine. The 
resulting product will be a fine bimbaarka-kiranaadarsha, or reflected 
solar ray attracting mirror. This should be fixed in the central portion
 of the vimaana and in the 10th kendra, with five circled screws.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Now we deal with the crest crystal of the vimaana.
 The crest-crystals are of 103 kinds. They are named in 
"Mani-kalpa-pradeepika" as belonging to the 12th class of 32 groups of 
crystals. Their names are shankara, shaantaka, kharva, bhaaskara,

fixed as crest-jewels of the vimaana. One of them is to be fitted to the
 central pinnacle at the top of the vimaana, and the wires from the 
electric dynamo should be connected to it, so that it might be supplied 
with power. On the upper side should be attached wires for collecting 
solar rays, so that the two forces might act in combination.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The switch-gear for connecting the vimaana with 
the solar energy is explained in "Brihath-kaandika." Sandhaana-keelakaas
 are of 25 kinds. Their names are pinjuleeka, keeranaka, dimbhaka,

 to connect the vimaana with the solar beams for safe navigation. This 
is Pariveshakriyaayantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Angopasamhaara yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">During the passage of sun and other planets in the
 12 houses of the zodiac, owing to the varying speeds of their 
progressive and retrogressive motions, conflicting forces are generated 
in the zodiacal regions, and their collisions will let loose floods of 
fierce forces which will reduce to ashes the parts of the plane which 
get involved with them. The pilot should get warned by the 
ushna-pramaapaka yantra, or heat-measuring instrument, and quickly fold 
the concerned parts and ensure their safety.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 42</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is described in "Yantrasarvasva" as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Purifying the metal sumrileeka mixed with 
manjeera, a pedestal should be cast, 12 feet long, 18 inches thick, and 
shaped as a square or circle. Then mixing the magnetic stone and 
dimbika, after purifying them with acids, cast a pole 3 feet thick and 
30 feet tall, with springs, as in an umbrella, at the foot, in the 
middle and at the upper end, and fix it in the centre of the pedestal. 
Rods made of mixed metal like umbrella rods, provided with 5 springs, 
should connect the springs in the pole with the several limb mechanisms 
of the vimaana. Two revolving wheel springs with two tubes with 3 faces 
and 3 wheeled springs should be fixed at the bottom of the pole, near 
the spring. Above there should be fixed an oiling tube which will keep 
all the springs well-oiled. When a particular limb of the plane has to 
be contracted the spring at the foot of the pole should be turned so as 
to induce the spring of the part to operate so as to contract or open up
 the part as need be so that the danger to the part will be prevented. 
By the operation of the angopasamhaara yantra, any part of the plane can
 be folded up to avoid danger and opened out subsequently.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vistritaasyaa kriyaa yantra or wide-opening mechanism:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When the various powers, subterranean, eight 
cardinal points, earth, cloud, electricity, and oceanic, consemble in 
padma-mukha, a power called vishambharee is generated. It breaks through
 the earth, emitting great heat, mounts with a 300 linka

 the vimaana, and affects the personnel inside causing grave physical 
disabilities, and paralysing the brain. For the purpose of curbing it 
and nullifying it, the vistritaasyakriyaa yantra is to be installed in 
the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Yantrasarvasva," a foot-plate, of an
 arm's length, and 22 inches thick, and round-shaped, is to be made of 
the wood of the sacred peepul tree. A pole of an arm's thickness, and 32
 inches high, is to be fixed in the middle of it. Reversible wheeled 
double-switches should be fixed along its height, connecting each of the
 sectional mechanisms in the vimaana, through tubes reaching to the 
bhastrikaa naala or bellows tube attached to the mechanisms. At the foot
 of the pole three revolving wheels, and at its back the contracting 
switches, have to be fixed</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 43</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First peetha or footplate, then pillar, then 
revolving springs, jointure tubes, two-wheeled keelakas, two-winged 
bellows, three wheel moving mechanism, contracting mechanism, are eight 
constituent parts of this machine.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First the triple wheeled mechanism should be 
switched on. That will set the double wheels in motion. That will make 
all the springs attached to the pillar begin to operate. The two winged 
bellows attached to the double-wheels will open up. Wind will rush out 
and force through all the sandhi-naalas or jointure tubes. That will set
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#10"><font color="#0000DE">the</font></a>
 bellows in the central operating; thereby the bellows of the sectional 
mechanisms will come into play, and air will flow out in a flood, and 
taking hold of the vishambharaa shakti expel it to the aerial regions 
where it will get lost. Thus the personnel inside the vimaana will be 
saved from disabilities and restored to normalcy.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vyroopya mirror: Says "Yantrasarvasva",</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When enemy planes come intent on destroying the 
vimaana, the vyroopya mirror is intended to frustrate them. Its parts 
are, peetha or stand, central switch-gear, electric pole, smoke tube, 
betel-nut oil, triple-wheeled spring, three satchels, smoke light, and 
contraction tube.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha or seat should be 2 feet wide and 2 
feet tall, and circular, and made of bael tree wood. 12 centres are to 
be marked therein. At each centre revolving joints should be fixed. 
Jyotistambha or electric pole, 24 inches thick and 24 inches tall and 
made of vyroopya darpana glass, is to be fixed in the centre. In front 
of it the electric machine should be fixed in the 2nd kendra. In the 3rd
 kendra should be fixed the turning smoke tubes with winding wires. The 
oil vessel should be fixed in the 5th kendra. The 3 satchels, with 3 
mouths, one foot high and made of milk-leather should be fixed in the 
6th 7th, 8th and 9th kendras, up to the smoke tube. In the tenth kendra 
should be fixed the smoke-extinguishing tube mechanism, and the 
light-extinguishing tube in the eleventh kendra. The winding wire tube 
should be fixed in the 12th kendra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The operation of the mechanism is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Drawing the electrical energy from the dynamo, it 
must be applied to the triple-wheeled mechanism. That will be set in 
motion. The wires</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 44</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">proceeding from there will convey the power to all
 the other mechanisms and set them in motion. Kendras 3, 4, and 5, will 
become active. When kendra, 9 is switched on the koshas attached thereto
 will become active. From the 5th kendra the current should be passed to
 the oil vessel. The oil will then convert itself into poisonous .gas. 
The gas should be filled in the 3 satchels and the 3 tubes. The fumes 
from two of the tubes should then be discharged towards the enemy 
planes. They will encircle the enemy planes and envelope them with a 
smoke-screen. Then the betelnut oil should be lighted, and fluxed in the
 jyoti stamhha or light-pillar. The light within the pillar will suffuse
 it with red glow like a china rose; and pervade the sky. Then the 
electric glow should be applied to that glow. The resulting glow will be
 multi-coloured like a rain-bow, with violet, indigo, blue, green, 
yellow, orange, and red. Then the poison-fumes from the 3rd tube should 
be drawn through the air tube, and let into the multicolour-glowing 
light-pillar. The fume will burst into light, and then should be passed 
through tube into the vyroopya-darpana. The light glow will pervade the 
mirror and attain 3000 degree intensity, causing a blinding glare and 
paralising the enemy. Then the gas in the three satchels should be 
projected with 25 linka speed towards the smoke screen enveloping the 
enemy. Then the smoke from the tubes should be projected with 28 linka 
speed into that screen. Then the smoke filled glow will flood over the 
enemy personnel and affect their body joints, organs, mind, vision, and 
induce inertness, and make them all fall down senseless. Then the pilot 
could change his air-route and proceed forward safely.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then Padmachakra mukha yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Yantra sarvasva," its parts are, 
peetha or pedestal, pillar, tubular pole, electric wiring, glass lotus 
petals, lotus formation process, places where the lotuses are to be 
located, wind inhaling and leather-bellows mechanism, contracting and 
expanding switches, triple-wheel fixing arrangement, air flow outlets, 
folding up mechanism. These are the 12 parts of the padmachakra mukha 
yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha or seat should be made of the wood of 
pippala or the holy fig tree, 8 feet and 3 feet high, and square or 
circular. Mark 12 fixing centres on it. From the central pillar draw 
lines towards the 12 spots. The central pole, two tubular posts on 
either side of it, electric wire in eastern centre,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 45</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">lotus petals in the north, formation of lotus in 
the northern and southern centres, fixing of the lotuses from the 
north-east to the south-east corner, to the east air-filling bellows. In
 the north west corner the contracting switch, and the expansion switch 
in the south-west corner, triple-wheel revolving mechanism on the 
eastern side, air flow outlets underneath each lotus. To its south, the 
contraction switch.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">These are the 12 parts to be fixed in the 12 centres. The production of the parts is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The central pivot should be made of abhra-mrid-darpana, or mica-sand glass. According to "Darpana-prakarana"--</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">5 parts of rambhasatva (plantain stem?), 8 of 
manjoosha (madder root?), 5 parts of kaanta (ayaskaanta? sooryakaanta?),
 8 parts of kravyaada (jataamaamsi), 3 parts of aadhaka essence, 7 parts
 of tortoise shell essence, 18 of bhalyatvak, 3 essence of kudmala or 
flower buds, 8 of bamboo salt, 3 of hooves, 28 parts of shoonya-mrid or 
mica ash, 4 of trivikrama kshaara, 2 of conch, 5 of mercury, 8 of salts,
 1 of creepers, 3 of silver, 3 of eye-ointment, these 18 ingredients, 
purified, filled in crucible, placed in varaatakunda furnace and boiled 
to 200 degrees, and slowly filled in darpana yantra, will yield an 
excellent abhra-mrid darpana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Two tubular poles of the size of an arm, made of 
this glass, should be placed on either side of the pivot. From the 
central pole electrical wiring should be connected to the 12 centres. In
 the centre of the switch tubes should be placed the lotus petals, and 
150 finely made glass lotus petals should be spread on the northern side
 electric wires.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The petals are to be made, according to Lalla, by 
mixing 15 parts of the mica glass, with 4 parts of sourika salt, duly 
mixed and finely powdered and melted in pattikaa machine, when like 
onion-skin layers, petals will take shape. Then the wires attached to 
the petals should be brought together from the several centres, and 
attached to the lotus forming mechanism. By turning the concerned wheel 
the petals will move towards the centre and form a lotus. Each petal 
will then become a tube, and by their juggling each</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 46</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">tube will form 2 petals. The air-attracting 
mechanism should be placed in front and set to work. With a shrieking 
noise the air will be sucked in by each tube and the petals will shoot 
the air far into the outer air.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in "sandhaana-patala--"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The scattering of a blizzard which may obstruct 
the progress of the vimaana is only possible by means of the 
padma-sandhaana and not otherwise. Therefore the spots where the lotuses
 are to be inserted are now indicated. On the eastern side from the 
north east to the south east the lotuses are to be erected in seven 
places in close order. Beneath the seven lotuses should be fixed seven 
leathern bellows capable of deep draughts of air. On the north west 
corner should be fixed the double-wheeled contracting mechanism.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Kriyaa saara," by turning the main 
wheel in right motion, and the upper wheel in reverse motion at full 
speed, the yantra will suffer contraction. This machine is composed of 6
 wheels spread out, 5 naalaas or tubes, 12 wires and 12 openings, and 12
 keys which will cause contraction of the 12 parts, with widened mouth 
at the upper and lower parts, and provided with 2 revolving keys. By 
placing such a contracting machine in the north-west corner, the machine
 could be contracted when desired.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Now we shall deal with the expanding mechanism. It
 is round like a water pot, with 12 wheels and mouths, having 12 tubes 
with rods inside with 12 revolving springs for ascending motion, and 
with a central spring for filling with air. With such a mechanism the 
yantra can be made to stretch its parts. This should be fixed in the 
south west corner.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then at the eastern face the triple-wheeled revolving spring, called "bhraamanee-keelaka", should be fixed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It has 3 ivory wheels, consists of 3 poles, wooden
 top shaped like shimshumaara, with wheels with spring on top. By its 
operation the several parts of the yantra are set in motion, and by the 
operation of the concerned springs, the yantra will expand. Therefore 
the 3 wheeled bhraamanee mechanism should be properly fixed at the 
eastern kendra with 5 bolts.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Underneath the lotuses air flow routes should be 
provided. There should be openings 12 inches wide, 2 inches high, be 
leather-covered, made</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 47</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">of pippala wood, with 7 tubes for the flow of 
wind. Seven such tubes should be fixed beneath the seven lotuses, and 
provided with keys.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the southern centre the contracting mechanism or upasamhaara keela, with 12 outlets, should be fixed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Owing to the seasonal changes forces will generate
 in the joints of the outer space, and combining with the oceanic forces
 will reach the realm of air and cause a commotion which will spread out
 with fierce force into the farthest air pockets, and let loose typhoons
 which reach the vimaana, and produce a dusty excrescence which will 
induce chicken-pox-like skin eruptions on the pilots and other 
occupants, and also break up the vimaana. In order to suck up that foul 
wind-flow, and expel it out of the vimaana, the padma-patra-mukha yantra
 is prescribed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Kuntinee-shakti-yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Now we shall deal with kuntinee-shakti yantra. In 
mid-summer, out of the myriad heat rays of the sun, by the union of the 
3, 5, and 10th class of rays, a fierce force of blazing heat named 
kulakaa is generated.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in "Ritukalpa",</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">From the solar heat generative source 3 
Mahaakshoni and 21 crores 500 lakhs 16 thousand and nineteen heat rays 
emanate. They are classified into 5 crores 8 thousand and 107 groups in 
Vaalmeeki ganita. Each group is divisible into 100 sub-groups. Of these 
when the rays of sub-groups 3, 5, 10 from the second group get mixed up 
in the heart of summer, a force called Kulakaa with fiery intensity is 
generated; and when it moves into the path of the flying vimaana, the 
plane will be reduced to ashes. To protect against that the 
kuntinee-shakti yantra should be installed in the neck portion of the 
vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Sage Narayana also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Amongst the divisions of the heat rays of the 
summer sun, the second group has 85000 rays. Out of them those numbered 
8, 3, and 10 are specially intense, and they attract the pramlochana 
shakti from koorma portion of the universe, and produce a fierce 
heat-wave called kulikaa. If a vimaana happens</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 48</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">to encounter it in its course, it will be burnt to
 ashes. To safeguard against that the kuntinee-shakti yantra should be 
installed in the neck section of the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Lallaachaarya also confirms:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Out of the many groups of the heat-rays of summer,
 numbers 3, 5, and 10 in the 32nd division of the 2nd group of rays' 
tend to contact the pramlochana shakti in koorma and produce a fierce 
force called kulakaa which will destroy the vimaana. The erection of the
 kuntinee-shakti yantra in the vimaana will prevent it from such 
destruction.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Yantra Sarvasva",</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Among the constituent yantras of the vimaana, the 
kuntinee-shakti yantra is required to protect it from the combustible 
heat waves known as kulikaa in summer. Its parts are ground-plate, 
central switch-board, acid vessel cloth, with folds, chakradanti naala, 
milk cloth, tube covering switches, revolving wheel equipped with 
electric wiring, and contracting mechanism.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha or ground-plate should be 3 feet wide 
and ½ foot high, and round like a drinking bowl, seven kendras or 
centres commencing from the eastern side, turning switches in the seven 
centres, the acid vessel in the central kendra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Kriyaasaara" Says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">For capturing kulikaa the oil from gunja or the 
seeds of the shrub abrus and tobacco leaves, and mercury and shanaka 
crystal are recommended for use. The oils or acids of the seeds and 
tobacco leaves are to be filled in goblet like cup made of glass made of
 naaga, crownchika, and sowrambha metal, add purified mercury, and fix 
in the central kendra. Then apply the solar rays to the vessel. By the 
action of the rays on the acids the crystal in the vessel will become 
charged with a cold frigid force called krownchinee. Then when the 
kulikaa force enters the vessel with its fierce heat, it will be sucked 
in by the cold-storage crystal.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the left kendra the cloth with folds should be fixed. Says "Patakalpa.--"</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 49</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to confine in the crystal the fierce heat
 of kulikaa it should be wrapped in the folds of a cloth of fine and 
strong texture made of spikenard and jute yarn, with 5 folds and 3 
openings. From the openings 3 glass tubes should be projected with 
downward bends into 3 wide mouthed vessels. To the north--east must be 
fixed the chakradanti naala for attracting the kulikaa force. 
Snake-skin, gum of srini, woollen yarn, soft grass, should be boiled 
together and lac-coloured cloth-like glass prepared, and purified with 
sundikaa wood oil. It should he rolled in coils just as a snake circles 
up in coils and sleeps. The tiny glass tubes should be attached at the 
bottom of the chakradanti as directed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then ksheeree-pata naala, or milk-cloth tube is to
 be fixed. Made of milk-cloth with wide-opening, strong, soft, a tube 
should he inserted in the mouth of the chakradanti, and its end should 
be made to reach the hole in the peetha. Through that the kulikaa force 
makes its exit. After placing ksheeree pata naala like this with key, 
the electric wire connected central operating switch should be placed in
 the west. And to the north-east of it the vistritaasya or opening out 
switch should be fixed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says "Kriyaasaara":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It should have two satchels, two openings, two 
right-revolving and reverse-revolving wheels. In the eastern opening 
should be fixed the 2 right-revolving wheels. And in the northern mouth 
should be fixed the 2 reverse motion wheels. And as in an umbrella, 
sticks connecting all the parts with the centre, for the purpose of 
expansion and contraction by turning a switch. By operating the switch 
in the eastern opening all parts will open out or expand. By operation 
of the northern switch all parts will close up. This is the upasamhaara 
keelakaa.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having enumerated the parts of the yantra, their 
operation is now given. First the electric switch. By putting it on, the
 Bhraamanee chakra or pivotal wheel will revolve setting in motion 
individual parts as and when desired by turning their respective 
switches. Then electric current should be passed to the acid containing 
the crystal. Solar rays also should then be passed into it. Thereby, in 
the acid there will be generated a female shakti of 5 nyankas called 
sowlikaa. Similarly in the crystal there will be generated a male shakti
 of 8 nyankas called chulikaa. By operation of the electric</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 50</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">current the two shaktis will get unified and 
produce an extremely cold shakti called "crownchinee," capable of 
attracting the kulikaa. That crownchinee force should be projected 
through naala or tube towards the kulikaa, like imbedding a gunja pea in
 a lump of lac. Thereby the crownchinee will drag the kulikaa inside the
 yantra through the tube and drop it into the acid vessel where it will 
be imbibed by the crystal.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then the patormikaa key should be turned, whereby 
the patormikaa will become wide open preventing any air from entering 
the crystal by covering it completely. Then the chakradanti key should 
be turned slowly, so that its mouth opens out and sucks the hot kulikaa 
from the crystal, and stores it inside itself. Then the key of the 
sookshmaadarsa naala, fine mirror tubes, should be operated. The kulikaa
 in chakradanti will emerge through the 3 tubes. Then the vistritaasya 
key should be operated quickly so that all the parts will open out, and 
the kulikaa shakti will get out and disappear, and the danger to the 
pilot will have passed. Then by operating the upasamhaara keelaka, the 
expanded parts will close up and the yantra will return to normalcy.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Now we shall deal with Pushpinee yantra. When the 
pilot has to travel during spring and summer months, the pushpinee 
yantra is intended to provide him with necessary comforts.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Khetavilaasa":</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In spring a force called sowrikaa emanates from 
the south-east. And in summer a force called panchashikhaa arises in the
 north-west and is intensified by the sun's rays. Panchashikhaa contains
 two kinds of poisons. Sowrikaa having fire and moon contents is cold 
and hot, cold internally, and hot externally. It generates warmth in all
 creations, making the human kind perspire, and the trees and vegetation
 bring out their milk and gums. Thereby their bodies are relieved of 
harmful materials likely to lead to diseases.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">By its cold effect and attracting the spring 
effect from the solar rays, it permeates all things, and brings out 
shoots, tendrils, flowers and a glow in all trees and creepers. 
Similarly it effects the 7 physiological components of the human body 
and increases their vigour, strength, growth, and glow.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 51</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Panchashikhaa shakti or force effects movable and 
immovable life adversely by its stultifying influence, shrinks and dries
 up the growth process of both vegetable and animal life and causes 
deterioration. To counteract this harmful effect of the season on the 
personnel of the vimaana, the pushpinee yantra is commended as one of 
the constituents of the aeroplane.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Its parts are, the base, the cold processing 
mirror, keelaka or key, cold generating crystal, acid vessel, electric

<p><font face="Arial">The sunda-mud made glass is prepared, according to
 "Paarthiva-paaka Kalpa" as follows. Take salt, shinjeera, bone, and 
betel-nut salt, durona, kuruvinda grass (cyperus rotundus), gum, 
sowraashtra mud, virinchi vatika or banyan bark, silk cotton tree bark, 
and coir salt, these ingredients are to be taken in the proportion of 5,
 12, 2, 3, 8, 3, 30, and 6, purified, filled in the crucible, and placed
 in the tortoise shaped furnace, boiled 32 times in 100 degree heat with
 the help of two faced bellows, and the resulting fluid poured into the 
cooling yantra. A pure and fine sunda-mud-glass will be formed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">With the glass thus produced by boiling 32 times, a
 base is to be formed 12 inches wide, 3 inches high, four-square or 
circular. From the centre of it 4 kendras or centres are to be marked. 
In the centre an arm-sized pivot made of the said glass should be fixed.
 On top of it is to be fixed the cold-processing mirror key. At its 
centre should be fixed the cold producing crystal. At the eastern centre
 should be placed the acid vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Dravapaatra or acid vessel is described in 
"Kriyaasaara." It should be 12 inches wide and 12 inches high, shaped

<p><font face="Arial">burning charcoal, and with the aid of the 
five-mouthed bellows blow the heat to 323 degrees temperature, and pour 
the liquid into the yantra. The resulting glass is called 
sheeta-ranjikaadarsa or cold-receptacle glass.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Cold-producing crystal is described in 
"Maniprakarana": 5 parts of couries and manjula powder, 4 parts udumbara
 salt, 3 of rubhna, 8 parts of varchulaka, 7 of sheeta ranjikaadarsha, 3
 of vatu, 28 of shaalmali, 3 of salts, 7 of mercury, 8 of white mica, 8

sampaathi bird kneebone--</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">These 14 ingredients, in the named proportions are
 to be purified and filled in mritkundala-moosha or earthen crucible, 
and placed in kulakundika furnace, and with the aid of tryambaka bellows
 blown into 300 degree temperature. Fill the boiled liquid into the 
mani-prasoothika, or crystal forming yantra. The crystal produced will 
be pure, hard, and intensely cold.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In front of it should be fixed .the electric panka wheel, with 100 spokes and electric wiring, and purified by 3 acids.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">As per "Kriyaasaara," 12 parts of copper, 3 of 
collyrium, 8 of zinc, should be mixed and melted with 100 degree heat. 
It will become pure like gold, yellow, fine, soft, and strong. It is 
called pancha-loha or five-in-one metal by those who know. 100 leaves 
like those of lotus should be formed out of them. Then 3 navels, three 
navel keys, and 3 wires, and a sounding keelaka or key, or switch, or 
wheel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First the navel wheels with hinged rods should be 
fixed so that the 100 petals will he made to revolve with due speed on 
the four sides of the wheel. Similarly by the side of the wheel in front
 of it, another 100 petals should be properly fixed for revolving in 
reverse direction. And electric wires should be fixed on both sides of 
the centre of the western wheel, for operating the 100 spoked electric 
panka or fan. Then the vessel should be filled with the cold generating 
acid. And encircling the cold-generating mani or crystal, it should be 
placed in another vessel in the centre. And copper wiring enclosed in 
milk-cloth should be attached to the wire in the acid vessel. Two wires 
from there with switches should be connected with the cold ranjikaa 
glass or mirror in right-turning fashion. Then current should be 
switched into the electric wiring in the crystal and acid. Then by the 
contact of the electric current the forces within the crystal and the 
acid will get active and their</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 53</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">combined cooling and comforting quality will enter
 the cold ranjanikaa mirror and concentrate in it. On operating the 
switch attached to it, the cold effect will spread out all over the 
interior of the vimaana, and overcoming the scorching seasonal effect, 
make it comfortable and pleasant for the pilot, and restore his 
efficiency. Similarly the 100 spoked panka (fan?) should be switched on,
 when a breeze will be generated and air-condition the atmosphere of the
 pilots. Thus by the use of the crystal, acid, and panka, a state of 
pleasant comfort will be induced, and vigour, exhilaration, and 
competence will be injected into all the limbs of the body. Therefore 
this Pushpinee yantra should be installed in the southern section of the
 vimaana.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Next Pinjula Aadarsha or Pinjulaa Mirror:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">By the collision of two winds giving rise to a 
whirlwind, and the fierce solar ray dashing against it, a lightning bolt
 erupts and strikes the unwary vimaana. To protect against such an 
event, the pinjula mirror is to be installed. An eight petalled lotus is
 to be made of the pinjula glass. Where the petals join, a circular 
dandaakaara should be made. At the back two hinged bolts should be 
fixed. They should be wound round by wires from the cold mirror. The 
back should be covered with a coir-made cloth covering. It should be 
fixed in the southern side of the vimaana, at an arm's height, facing 
the sun. The lightning will be absorbed by the projecting rods coiled 
with wires from the cold aadarsha mirror, and no evil effect will occur,
 and the pilot can proceed in safety.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">And Naalapanchaka or Five tubes:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">If the smoke from the kitchen over of the vimaana 
spreads, it will cause discomfort for people inside. Therefore the five 
tubes or pipes should be inserted for the smoke to go out and the air 
become clear. The pipes are to be manufactured as follows. Magnetic 
iron, pinjula mica, ghontaara metal, dhoomapaasya metal, and tortoise 
shell, are to be taken in the proportion of 1, 7, 5, 5, 8, purified, 
filled in crucible, and melted with 100 degree heat, and when ultimately
 cooled, a fine metal called vaataayanee metal, or window metal will 
result shining like gold.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">With that metal 5 tubular outlets, 12 inches in 
diameter and 12 inches in length, should be fashioned. At one end of 
each of the tubes should be fixed</font></p>

<font color="#0000DE">smoke-absorbing</font></a> crystal. The tubes 
should be inserted in the 4 sides of the vimaana, forming outlets. One 
tube should be fixed at the ceiling. The dhoomapa crystals will attract 
the smoke and pass it to the outside, and clear the vimaana of its 
discomfort. Hence the necessity for the naalapanchaka, or five tubes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then Guhaa-garbha aadarsha yantra, or hidden mine

<p><font face="Arial">According to "Yantra Sarvasva" enemies would have 
placed mines and bombs underground for the destruction of the vimaana, 
unless they are discovered and de-fused in time there would be danger. 
Therefore the mine-finder yantra has to be installed in the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says kriyaasaara, out of the 72nd type of glass, 
make a triangular, a circular, and a quadrangular shaped glass mirrors. 
These are to be fixed as follows with bolts made of pancha-dhaaraa metal
 in a frame made of the wood of the anjishtha tree. The circular mirror 
should be fixed at the bottom facing downwards. The quadrangular mirror 
should be fixed facing upwards. The triangular mirror should be fixed to
 the west of these two, with a panchamukha keelee or 5 faced hinge. From
 the main pivot of the quadrangular mirror to the foot of the bolt at 
the south-east corner of the yantra, wires made of copper, tiles, and 
panchaasya metal should be drawn and connect them, and then the wire 
ends and chumbaka crystal should be placed in the mercuric-sulphur acid 
vessel. Four other wires should be made to circle the triangular mirror,
 pass through the mirror facing upwards, and fixed to the centre of the 
down-ward facing mirror. Then solar rays should be let in from the 
western side. A screen cloth coated with mirror-like gum should be 
placed opposite to the triangular mirror. Then the solar rays and 
electric current should be passed into the acid vessel containing the 
crystal. When the electrified rays from the crystal are passed on to the
 downward facing mirror, they will explore the ground over which the 
vimaana is to pass, and discover mines and bombs like mahagola and 
agni-garbha, which may have been inserted there and reflect their 
complete picture in the crystal in the acid vessel. The picture will 
then be projected to the screen opposite in clear detail, and by washing
 with chemicals present a perfect photograph of the buried mines and 
bombs, which could then be destroyed by due safety measures. Therefore 
the guhaa-garbha aadarsha yantra or mine-discovering yantra is essential
 for a vimaana.</font></p>

7, 3, 9, 30, duly pulverised and filling in a beaked crucible, placed in
 a vaaraaha furnace, and heated to the 100th degree with the aid of the 
tortoise-shaped bellows. When the finely boiled liquid is poured in the

aanjishtha is the finest." "The trees having 5 qualities are 87 in 
number. The best among them all is aanjishtha," says "Udbhijya tatva 
saaraayanee."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Agatatvalaharee also says, the five qualities such
 as the capacity to capture reflections, and others, are found inherent 
in the Aanjishtha (or madder root) tree. Therefore out of all woods the 
wood of that tree is most suitable for use in this yantra.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Pancha-dhaara-loha</font></p>

 is very useful for capturing reflections.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Chumbaka crystal is the one most suited for use in
 capturing reflections of objects. It is manufactured as per

<p><font face="Arial">Its working is as follows. On turning the wheel in
 the south east, the two faced mirror fixed to the tube will revolve and
 collect the solar rays. By operating the wheel in the north west, the 
acid in the vessel will begin functioning. By slightly moving the wheel 
in the south-east, the solar rays will enter the crystal in the acid 
vessel. By turning the wheel in the west, the darkness intensifying 
mirror will begin to function. By turning the central wheel the rays 
attracted by the mirror will reach the crystal and</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">envelop it. Then the main wheel should be revolved
 with great speed, when the darkness will be produced enveloping the 
vimaana and making it invisible, and the efforts of the enemies to 
attack it with poison gas and rays will miss their target and become 
ineffective. This yantra should be placed in the north-west sector of 
the Vimaana Panchavaataskandha-Naala.</font></p>

benzoin tree bark, pancha tikta or 5 sours, snake gourd, and paaduka, 
are to be powdered, cleaned, and in equal quantities filled in padmaasya
 crucible, and placed in vishvodara furnace and heated to 200 degrees. 
The molten liquid poured into the mould will yield excellent flame-proof
 roudree-darpana glass.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">With this roudree-darpana glass a plank of 16 feet
 in dimension should be prepared. A pivot 25 inches thick should be 
fixed at the centre of the plank. At the edge Of the pivot, two wheels 
should be fixed revolving with right motion and reverse motion for 
expanding and contracting. A wheel equipped with rods for spokes should 
be fixed, the spokes being 15 inches from each other. Sheets made of 
roudree glass, washed with linseed, drona or lucas aspera, liquid amber,
 and madder root oils should be fixed to the rods with hinges. Similarly
 crystals made of roudree-darpana glass, with 5 facets, cleaned with the
 oils should be fixed at the end of the rods. Between each rod 18 leaves
 like lotus leaves with revolving keys should be fixed. The instrument 
is to be shaped like an umbrella. The leaves should be fixed at the 
pivot top with 8 keys.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When the burning flames are imminent, the pilot 
should turn the expansion wheel vigorously, and the umbrella will open 
up and provide a shielding cover for the vimaana. The lotus petals, the

cause hardship to pilots and other occupants. Therefore as a safe-guard 
against it, the Vaatastambhana-naala-yantra should be installed in the

of each tube a vaatapaa or air imbibing crystal should be fixed by 
wires. Between the tubes flags or pennants made of cotton-cloth duly 
processed, should be tied. And wheels made of the special metal should 
be fixed above each pennant. When the vaataayanee wind blast blows, the 
pennants will flutter noisily, and the wheels fixed underneath them will
 also revolve as also the crystals. The fluttering pennants pass the 
blowing wind to the wheels which pass them on to the crystals, which 
will pass them into the tubes from which they will be ejected through 
openings to the outside. That will protect the vimaana from their

<p><font face="Arial">Kuranga or pallatory root, panchaasya metal, 
virinchi, shonaja or red lead, sand, alum, kutbha or hellebore, pearl, 
sundaaliga, mercury, yavakshaara or salt-petre, borax, bidouja salt, 
pingaaksha or terminalia chebula (?), cowries, and karbura or hedychum 
specatum, powdered and purified, in the proportion of 10, 7, 4, 3, 12, 
2, 3, 7, 11, 27, 14, 3, 22, 18, 5, and 11, filled in padmaasya crucible,
 placed in vishvodara furnace, and with the aid of the 5 mouthed bellows
 heated to 500 degrees, the molten liquid will yield in the cooling 
mould a glass which is impregnated with 300 shaktis or forces, and can 
overpower the lightning blasts from the vaaruni and agni forces, shining
 with wonderful rays, and capable of spreading its own lighting force 
within 2 kshanas or a few seconds to a distance of 5 yojanas or 15 
miles.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">With that lightning darpana glass should be 
constructed the Vidyuddarpana yantra. A plank, 20 feet in diameter and 1
 foot high, square or circular in shape should be prepared, 4 glass 
tubes of crescent moon shape should be fixed around the peetha or plank.
 In the centre should be fixed a cage made of chumbuka glass, fitted 
with wires and 5 faced switches at each face, and 5 goblets made of 
vidyuddarpana. In the centre should be fixed a spire made of the same 
glass with 7 cross spokes and tubes, 8 faced and 10 angled. By turning 
the key inside, the spire is to revolve with speed. That will attract 
and contain the lightning emitted by the clouds. The rays will expel it 
to the outer air region, and incapacitate it. Then a snow-like cool 
temperature will render the interior of the vimaana safe and pleasant 
for the pilot and other occupants. Therefore this vidyuddarpana yantra 
should be installed duly in the vimaana.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">"Kriyaasaara"' says--</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The spots from which sounds emanate in the sky are
 called shabda-kendras or sound centres. The different directions from 
which the sounds</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 62</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">are projected are called shabda-kendra mukhas. The
 yantra which is meant to control the sounds so projected is called 
shabda-kendra mukha yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Out of 304 classified sounds the sounds of 
water-laden clouds, wind, and lightning are said to be fiercest. In the 
8th region of the sky these three sounds unify in the shishira Ritu or 
February-March period, and produce ear-splitting thunders. They would 
deafen pilots and others in the vimaana. As protection against that the 
shabda-kendra mukha yantra is to be installed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in Shabda-nibandhana, "By the 
combination of water, fire, air, and sky, sound is generated both among 
living and life-less objects. The sounds in the word "Shabdaha," i.e., 
sha, b, d, and ha, indicate water, fire air, and sky symbolically."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Naamarthha-kalpa" says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">We shall deal with the nature of sound or 
"shabdaha". The word consisting of sounds sha, ba, da, and ha, stands 
for water, fire, air, and sky. By the combination of these four forces 
in various proportions, 304 different kinds of sounds are generated.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Braahmana bhaaga of the Veda also says 
shabdaas are of 304 kinds, such as sphota or embryo, very feeble sound, 
feeble sound, manda or soft, very soft, fast, very fast, medium, very 
medium, great sound, thunder sound, and thunder-bolt sound.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in Yantra-Sarvasva,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the 8th region of the sky, by the concatenation
 of water-cloud, wind and fire, an extremely fearful thunder clap will 
occur which will blast the ears of pilots who may enter the region. To 
safeguard against that the vaataskandha mukha yantra is to be installed 
in the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the 8th region of the sky there are 307 centres
 of sound. From the 70th centre a fierce sound proceeds by the force of 
water. From the 312th centre a fierce sound produced by wind will 
emanate. Similarly from the 82nd centre a fierce sound generated by 
lightning will emanate. By collision of the three a terrible sound will 
result which will deafen the pilots of the vimaana. Therefore facing 
each sound emanation centre the shabdopasamhaara yantra is to be 
established.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 63</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The construction of the yantra is as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Gavyaarika, monkey's skin, duck-weed, shana-kosha 
or jute product, crounchika or lotus stalk, vaaripishtaka or shag, 
roonthaaka, flesh, elephant trunk, and tin, are to be purified, and the 
nine elements, other than the skin, in equal parts, filled in niryaasa 
yantra and baked for 3 days with buffalo bile, will yield a decoction of
 fine scarlet colour. Seven times this decoction should be spread on the
 skin, and left to dry in the sun. The skin will then acquire the 
capacity to suppress sound.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">A box 2 feet long and 1 foot high made of badhira 
or deaf metal is to be made. Two pipes made of the same metal shaped 
like crane's beak, should be fixed inside it. Above it should be fixed 
an umbrella made of shabdapaa darpana, or sound-drinking glass. A 
crystal washed with tulasee or basil seed oil should be placed inside 
the monkey skin and sealed with rhinoceros gum. The sealed skin with 
crystal should be placed in the central pipe inside the box. Monkey skin
 alone should be placed in the pipe on the left side. Thin wires should 
connect them all and be fitted with hinges and switches. Above the 
canopy of the box a monkey skin shaped like lion's mouth should be 
connected by wire through a pipe to the crystal in the tube inside the 
box. The top of the box should be covered, securely.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Badhira loha or deaf-proof metal is explained in 
Lohatantra-Prakarana; lime fruit, laguda or sweet-scented oleander, 
virinchi, rishika or water-calteop, maaloora or Bengal quince, 
panchaanana metal, luntaaka, varasimhika or solenum xunthokurpum, 
kuravaka or gigantic swallow-wort, sarpaasya or mesua ferrea, vaakula or
 surinam medlar, jack-fruit, camphor and vatika or salvinia cusullata, 
in equal parts, purified, and filled in tryutee crucible, and heated in 
the furnace, will when cast produce a metal, cold, dark, sound-proof, 
powerful, able to control bleeding, and draw out missile parts from the 
war wounds of soldiers and healing them, and capable of reducing the 
effect of thunder claps.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The simhaasya bellows is to collect the fierce 
sound and transmit it to the crystal inside the metal box so that the 
monkey skin will absorb it and stifle its intensity. Therefore 
shabda-kendra mukha yantra should be installed in the vimaana.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Vidyud-dwaadashaka Yantra, or Yantra of 12 lightnings is explained in Kriyaasaara.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the realm of the comets and shooting stars in 
the sky, at the 8th region there are 30703221 shooting stars. 8000 of 
them are prone to lightnings, and 12 of them known as mahaakaala etc., 
are of importance.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Shakti-tantra says, "The 12 lightnings which form 
the eyes of the shooting stars are named, rochishee, daahakaa, simhee, 
patanga, kaalanemikaa, lataa, vrindaa, rataa, chandee, mahormee, 
paarvanee, mridaa."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kheta-sarvasva Says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Mahaakaala, mahaagraasa, mahaajwaalaamukha, 
visphulinga mukha, deerghavaala, khanja, mahormika, sphulinga-vamana, 
ganda, deergha-jihva, duronaka, and sarpaasya are 12 comets with 12 
lightning eyes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The lightning effects of the comets are extremely 
severe in the period of sharat or autumn, October and November, and 
vasanta or spring, March and April. By the collision of the solar rays 
and the lightnings a force called ajagara is created. When the vimaana 
reaches the 20th region of the sky, that force paralyses the plane. To 
protect against such happenings the vidyuddwaadasha yantra is to be 
installed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Yantra Sarvasva also Says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vidyuddwaadasa yantra is excellent in protecting 
against the lightning effect of comets. Its details are as follow. First
 duly coated jataghana should be prepared. It should have 22 folds so as
 to cover the vimaana. Poundraka and other crystals should be fixed in 
each of the folds. Then mahorna acid should be placed inside in the 
north-east side of the vimaana. 8 rods, each of 6 arms length, made of 
anti-lightning glass should be fixed in the 8 directions over the cover 
of the vimaana. At the
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#14"><font color="#0000DE">beginning</font></a>,
 middle, and end of the vimaana canopy, spring wheels made of dambholee 
metal, 5 faced and interconnected should be fixed with revolving bolts. 
Cages made of wire should enclose the poundraka crystals, and the wire 
terminals should be attached to the spring wheels. The wire ends from 4 
of the cages should have a common switch.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">On the main wheel being put in speedy motion the 
12 crystal cages will revolve, the enveloping cloth cover will spread 
out, and the lightning</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 65</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">absorbing power of the cloth will be activated. 
The crystals will attract the ajagara lightning, bifurcate the comet 
lightning from the solar rays, and transmit it to the 8 rods. The rods 
will absorb and then transfer the lightning power to the folds of the 
power proof cloth. By operating the central switch in the enclosure, a 
force called vidyut-kuthaarika, or lightning-axe, will be generated in 
the acid, and it will attract the comet force from the cloth, and 
submerge it in the acid. Then by operating the end switch in the 
enclosure, the ajagara force in the acid will dart towards the pataghana
 cloth-cover and take refuge, where upon the blowing wind will evaporate
 it and nullify its effects, and the vimaana will be out of danger.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Says Yantra-sarvasva, "In order to control the 
movements of the forces of smoke, electricity and wind, and make them 
disperse, move, halt, or make stunt move or reverse move, the 
praana-kundalinee yantra is installed in the vimaana. A peetha or stand 3
 feet in diametre and 3 feet high, square or. circular, should be made 
of vrishala metal, with 8 kendras or central spots. In each central 
spot, two wheels with revolving hinges; small peethaas or plates with 3 
holes, 4 teeth, 3 pivots, in their middle a central pivot, three 
red-coloured tubes or pipes with opening and closing wheels, and

wings; from the north-east and south-east kendras and the middle-kendra 
in the west up to the middle of the course of the yaana kundalinee 
revolving wheels with pivots. Motions are by means of hand wheels. By 
the operation of the several wheels the plane will be set in motion. 
From the central pivot of the 8 kendras strong wires should pass the 
eastern peetha or footboard through randhras or holes and reach the tops
 of the 3 tubes at the window. The 3 forces should be made to aid the 
motion of the vimaana, and the remnant of the force should be passed

the 137th route in the sky there is a jala-pinjooshikaa shakti which 
will attract and spread them all over, and there will be a fierce 
outburst of dew and snow. Then 3 currents will be generated: one will be
 a damp cold air flow; the second will be a wet dewy flow; and the third
 will be a cold air flow. When the vimaana approaches that region, the 
first force will divest it of all power. The second force will benumb 
the pilots and operators. The third force will envelop the vimaana and 
make it invisible. Thus overcome, the vimaana will crash. As protection 
against such a happening the shaktyudgama yantra should be fixed in the

eight forces."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Chaara-nibandhana" also says, "According to the 
science of astronomy, planets and stars in the course of their

cold forces are generated in consequence."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Shakti-sarvasva" says, "When the star krittika 
comes near planet Mars, a force called shaktyudgamaa is generated. 
Similarly, by the star shatabhisha coming near the planet, Sun, a cold

sandhi-keelie should be fitted. Three tubes should be prepared out of 
the cold-proof glass, and should be fitted in front and on either side 
of the pilot's cock-pit. Bhraamanee chakra or wheel should be fitted at 
the front. When the three shaktis or forces attack the vimaana, the 
expansion wheel should be revolved vigorously<a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#15">.</a>
 It will first cover the pilots and then cover the entire plane also. By
 operating the bhraamanee wheel the attacking forces will be slowly 
absorbed, and the shaktis will be forced through the cold air tubes. By 
operating the main switch of the naala tantries, or wires, the forces 
will be made to go through the tubes into the outside air, and vanish 
therein. The pilot and the vimaana will both be saved from danger.</font></p>

be made out of the same metal. Then out of baka-tundila metal three 
wheeled keelakaas or hinges should be fixed at the front, back, and 
middle of the vimaana. The umbrella rod should be fixed in the middle of
 two keelakas.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The agnikuthaara crystal with metal cage should be
 fixed at the top like a crown. A three wheel switch revolving key 
should be fixed by the side of the pilot. Then wires made of 
kulishadhwamsa metal should be run from the crystal to the three wheeled
 revolving keelaka. In front of it shabda-naala tube with switch should 
be fixed. The yantra should be enclosed in a cover made of suranjikaa 
glass. When there is anticipatory thunder in the clouds, the glass 
covering cracks, and the tube of the wiring will emit sounds, and the 
wires will be severely shaken. When the pilot notices these signs, he 
should quickly set in motion the three-wheel keelee, which will revolve 
the umbrella with 100 linka speed. Then the crystal switch should also 
be turned, where-upon the crystal will also revolve with intense speed. 
By the speed of the revolution of the umbrella, the force of lightning 
will be stemmed, and the danger will be passed, leaving the vimaana and 
the pilot safe. That is the use of the shirah-keela yantra."</font></p>

directions of the vimaana, wired or wireless, up to 12 krosas or 27 
miles, caused by birds or quadrupeds or by men, with 8 mechanisms, the 
shabdaakarshana yantra is prescribed to be fixed in the shoulder of the 
vimaana. A peetha or foot-plate four-cornered or round should be made 
out of bidaala metal, with a pivot in the centre. On either side should 
be fitted machines which will attract any kind of sound and repeat it. 
With the soft leather of roruva or grinjinee bird two ball-shaped domes 
should be fixed. Between them in a suraghaadarsa vessel katana-drava 
acid should be filled and the vessel should be installed. Above the acid
 vessel and between the two globes should be fixed sound spotting rod 
made of sound capturing ghantaara metal, fitted with a bunch of wires. 
It should be enclosed in a cover made of kwanaka glass. In the corner 
three thumb size wheeled knots should be fixed. From them to the rod 
fine strong wires should be connected. Enclosing the wires a karanda or</font></p>

drona or grain measurer, should be placed on top of it. In the east and 
west and north and south 4 crystals named rudantee-ratikaa should be 
arranged with wires. Above it shabdaphenaka covering, with small shankus
 or screws fixed, should be placed. It should be covered by a covering 
made of kwanaadarsa glass, with 8 small holes. Wires starting from the 
screws and passing through the holes should reach the top of the 
covering. In the centre of it in an inch size hole simhaasya-danda-naala
 or tube should be fixed. In front of it a vaataapaakarshana chakra or 
wind wheel with 16 spokes with wires should be fixed. The wheels should 
be fixed in all 8 directions. In the simhaasya mukha naala or lion-faced
 tube on 8 sides revolving wheels should be fixed. 8 goblet like vessels
 made of pure vajeemukha metal should be fixed. Wires from the 8 holes 
of the covering should be placed in them. Similarly from the wind wheel 
wires should be connected to 8 screws in the 8 goblets on the simhaasya.
 Then from the 8 screws in shabda-phena, wires should be connected to 
the crystal in the acid vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">By the flow of wind the wheel turns with speedy 
right and left motion, and will set in motion the shabda-phena wheel. 
Then the wheels on the 8 screws also will turn. Then the sound detection
 rod made of sound-capturing ghantaara metal will be set in motion. 
Thereupon the two globes made of roruva-grinjinee skin will attract all 
sounds clearly and store inside themselves. By moving the central switch
 there the sounds will pass through the simhaasya tube and enter the 
dronaasya vessel, and make the sounds clearly audible to the hearer. The
 pilot will listen to the voices and direct the plane away from the 
vicinity of danger. Hence the shabdaakarshana yantra is prescribed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Kshoundeera loha is described in Lohatantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">8 parts of kshwinka or zinc, 5 parts of mercury, 7
 parts of krowncha alloy, 3 parts of kaanta or steel, 4 parts of hamsa 
or metallic silver, 1 part of maadhweeka, and 5 parts of ruru, these 
ingredients to be purified and filled in crucible, placed in 
chhatreemukha furnace, and with the acid of surasa bellows heated to 100
 degrees heat, and cast in mould will yield excellent kshoundeera alloy.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Filling this loha in pattikaayantra, applying 300 
degree heat and churning a fine strong pattikaa will be formed. With 
that, a shape like bellows, 5 arm's length high, and 3 arm's wide should
 be formed. It should be provided</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 81</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">with a mukha-naala or nozzle 6 feet in size. Its 
mouth should be like that of peshanee yantra. The opening should be 
covered and keyed. Three satchels should be attached at its bottom. In 
the middle an aavarana or covering with hare-skin, circular and provided
 with switch. Smoke or gas filling switch should be provided at its 
base. Above it a choorna paatra or powder vessel should be fixed. The 
switch key should be beneath the middle of the vessel. Thus four bellows
 should be prepared.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When the enemy plane's attack is expected, the 
aavaaraka bhastrika or enveloping bellows should shield the vimaana, and
 the 4 bellows should be fixed on the dikpeethaas or side seats above 
the aavarana or covering, and electricity should be applied to the 
choorna-paatra or powder keg. Immediately the powder becomes smoke. The 
bellows' mouth should be opened and the key turned. The emerging smoke 
fumes will enter the 4 small bellows, and from them reach the central 
kunda and spread all around and reach the bellows' mouth. Then on 
turning that key, the fumes will be emitted from all the bhastrikaas or 
bellows, and encompass the enemy plane and disable its occupants. That 
plane will be destroyed and the danger to one's vimaana overcome.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Stambhana Yantra<br> or Halting machine:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kriyaasaara says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">When power is generated by conflicting forces in 
the water-charged regions, shrieking hurricanes and whirl-winds will 
arise and set out in a mad career of destruction. To safeguard against 
their onslaughts, the Stambhana yantra should be installed in the bottom
 of the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Yantra sarvasva says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to protect the plane from the attacks of giant wind blasts, vimaana stambhana yantra is described as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">A peetha, one fourth the size of the vimaana 
floor, quadrangular, should be made out of vakratunda metal, three feet 
in thickness. In its 8 quarters spots should be marked for fixtures. An 
enclosure with openings, revolving toothed wheels made of the same 
metal, wheel rods with revolving keys, a metal band which is to encircle
 it thrice, toothed wheels, pivots, and switches and hinges, and 
three-stranded wire ropes, should also be of the same metal. In the 8 
selected spots naalaas or pivots with wheels and wiring should be fixed.
 Through the naala or pipe at the contraction switch of the vimaana,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 82</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">wires should be passed through the other naalas to
 the central pivot, and tied at the foot of the revolving wheel. When 
the dreaded wind current is observed the switch or wheel for the 
contraction or folding of the expanded vimaana parts should be turned, 
as also the 8 side wheel turning switches. That will reduce the speed of
 the vimaana. Then the switches of the 8 pivots on the peetha or 
foot-plate should be turned. The entire speed of the vimaana will be 
extinguished thereby. The wheel at the central pivot of the peetha 
should then be turned, so that the vimaana will be halted completely. 
Then the switch of the plane-wings should be turned. The flapping of the
 wings will produce winds which will encircle the vimaana and form a 
globe protecting it. Then by turning the switch of the brake-rod, the 
vimaana becomes motionless. Therefore the Yaana-sthambhana yantra should
 be fixed at the bottom centre of the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Vyshvaanara-naala yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kriyaasaara says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">For the purpose of providing fire for passengers 
to perform agnihotra or daily fire rituals, and for the purpose of 
cooking food, Vyshwaanara naala yantra is to be fitted up at the navel 
centre of the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Yantra-sarvasva says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">To provide fire for travellers in vimaanas, 
vyshwaanara naala yantra is now described. A 2 feet long and 12 inches 
wide peetha or foot-plate should be made out of naaga metal, 
quadrangular or circular in shape. Three kendras or spots should be 
marked thereon. Three vessels should be made of copper and karpara or 
(black jack?) zinc blended metal. One vessel should be filled with 
sulphur-brimstone acid. Another should be filled with rookshaka bdellium
 acid, or croton seed acid? And manjishta or madder root acid should be 
filled in another vessel. The three vessels should be placed on the 3 
kendra spots on the peetha.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the sulphur acid vessel the prajwaalaka mani or
 flame producing crystal should be placed. In the rookshaka acid vessel 
the dhoomaasya mani or smoke crystal should be placed. In the manjishtha
 acid vessel the mahoshnika mani, or heat producing crystal should be 
placed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the places in the vimaana where kitchens are 
located, and where sacred agnihotra fires are needed by passengers, 
keelaka sthambhas or pivots should be fixed. The acid vessels should be 
connected with power wires from the central pivot. The wires should be 
attached to the manis or crystals in</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 83</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">the acid vessels. At the top of the central pole 
jwaalaamukhee mani should be fixed in the centre of chumbakee keela with
 glass covering. On either side of it sinjeeraka mani and dridhikaa mani
 should be fixed. From each mani a wire should be stretched from the top
 of the central pole and fixed at the granthikeela at the foot of the 
pole. From there up to the cooking spots and agnihotra spots, a circle 
should be formed like a kulya, and metal tubes should be fixed therein. 
Wires should be drawn through the tubes to the fire places and fixed to 
the kharpara metallic pattikas therein.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First the bhadramushti keelaka should be revolved.
 The acid in the vessel will become heated. The heat generated in the 
rookshna acid will pass into the manjishtha mani, and generate smoke in 
the mahoshnika mani. By the force of that acid intense heat will be 
generated. And by the heat generated in the sulphuric acid vessel flames
 will erupt in the prajwaalika mani. The smoke, heat and flames will 
pass through the wires to the sinjeeraka, dridhikaa and jwaalaa-mukhee 
manis. Then the chumbaka wheel should be turned vigorously, whereupon 
the smoke, heat, and flames will reach the key at the top of the central
 pole. And on that keelee being turned, they will reach the central 
switchboard keelee at the foot of the pole. When that switch is put on, 
the heat and flames will reach the metal bands of the cooking ovens and 
religious fire places, and generate fires. Therefore vyshwaanara naala 
yantra should be fixed at the navel centre of vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">We have so far dealt with anga yantras or 
constituent machines of the vimaana. We proceed next to deal with 
Vyoma-yaanas or Aeroplanes.</font></p>
