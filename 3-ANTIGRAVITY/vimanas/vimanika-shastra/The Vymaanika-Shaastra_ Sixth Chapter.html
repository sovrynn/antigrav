<p><font face="Arial"><b>Maharshi Bharadwaaja</b>:</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">&#9758; <b>Jaati tryvidhyam Yugabhedaad Vimaanaanaam. Sootra 1</b>.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">"Three types according to changing Yugas."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to the differences in yugas, there are three different types of planes:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having dealt with the constituent mechanical parts
 of the Vimaana, we shall now deal with the Vimaanas according to their 
different classes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The sootra indicates that there are different types of planes, and that they are of 3 types.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the Krita Yuga, Dharma or Righteousness was 
four-footed, that is, it was four-square, fully established, all 
paramount, and it was adhered to implicitly by men. The men were 
inherently noble-born and were possessed of remarkable powers. Without 
needing to go through yogic discipline to attain special powers, or 
practise mantras which secured extraordinary results, the men of that 
yuga, merely by their devotion to dharma, became Siddhapurushaas or 
gifted with superhuman powers. They were virtuous men and men of 
learning and wisdom. Going in the sky with the speed of wind by their 
own volition was natural to them. The eight super-sensory, and now 
superhuman, attainments, known as animaa, mahimaa, garimaa, laghimaa, 
praaptih, praakaamya, eeshatwa, and vashitwa, were all possessed by 
them. That is, animaa is assumption of infinitesimal shape; mahimaa is 
growing into gigantic shape; garimaa is becoming astonishingly heavy; 
laghimaa is becoming weightless; praaptih is securing any desired thing;
 praakaamyam is becoming rid of desires; eeshatwa is attaining 
paramountcy; and vashitwa is becoming extremely pliant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Therefore in Krita Yuga, or first epoch, the ancients say, there were none of the three classes of Vimaanas.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Krita Yuga passed; and Tretaa Yuga commenced. 
Dharma then became limp of one foot. It served with 3 feet only, and 
grew gradually less efficient. So men's minds became dense, and the 
conception of Vedic truths, and anima and other super-sensory powers, 
became scarcer. Therefore, by the corrosion of Dharma or righteousness, 
men lost the power of flying in the sky with the speed of wind.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Perceiving this, God Mahadeva, desiring to confer 
the power of understanding the Vedas properly on the Dwijas, or 
brahmins, kshatriyas, and vysyas, graciously descended on earth in the 
form of Dakshinaamurthy, and through the instrumentality of Sanaka and 
other anointed sages, classified the Veda mantras, and then bestowing 
his benedictory glance on the worshipping Munis or ascetics, he blessed 
them with the gift of Vedic perception. And then to ensure that they 
were properly receptive, he embraced them and entered their hearts and 
illuminated their memories. The munis, overwhelmed by the Divine grace, 
aglow with
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#16"><font color="#0000DE">horripilation</font></a>, with voice choked with emotion, praised the Supreme with shata-rudreeya and other hymns, and manifested profound devotion.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Pleased with their receptiveness, divine 
Dakshinaamurthy, favouring them with a benign glance, and with smile on 
his face, said to them, "Till now you have been known as "Munis" or 
ascetics. Henceforth, having by my grace attained insight into the 
Vedas, you shall be known as "Rishis" or seers. You will cultivate the 
Vedic mantras, and practising
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#17"><font color="#0000DE">celibacy</font></a>,
 you will adore the divine Goddess of the Vedas, and winning her favour,
 and approaching the Great God Easwara by Yogic Samadhi, ascertain His 
mind, and by His and my grace, rising to the pinnacle of intellectual 
vision, become adepts in the meaning and purport of the Vedas; and 
confirming by them your own experiences and meditative introspection, 
you will create the Dharmashaastras or moral codes, Puranas and 
Itihaasas, and physical and material sciences, in conformity to the 
truths of the Vedas, for the benefit of mankind. And for travelling in 
the sky, propagate the art of manufacturing Vimaanas, and for attaining 
wind-speed, evolve Ghutica and Paadukaa methods through Kalpashaastras 
or scientific treatises."</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 86</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then those munis or seers, enshrining in their 
hearts God Mahadeva in the form of Dakshinaamurthy, produced the 
Dharmashaastras or ethical codes, epics, chronicles, manuals on rituals,
 treatises on the arts and sciences, ritualistic and sacrificial codes, 
in conformity to the Vedas, and propagated them among men. Amongst them 
it is said that there are six treatises bearing on the manufacture of 
Vimaanas produced by the ancient seers. In them are described three 
classes of vimaanas, known as maantrikaas, taantrikaas, and kritakaas, 
capable of flying everywhere.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in Vimaana Chandrika,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"I shall indicate the different kinds of vimaanas.
 In Tretaa yuga as men were adepts in mantras or potent hymns, the 
vimaanas used to be produced by means of maantric knowledge. In Dwaapara
 yuga as men had developed considerable tantric knowledge, vimaanas were
 manufactured by means of tantric knowledge. As, both mantra and tantra 
are deficient in Kaliyuga, the vimaanas are known as kritaka or 
artificial. Thus, owing to changes in dharma during the yugas, the 
ancient seers have classified the vimaanas of the 3 yugas as of 3 
different types."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Vyomayaana Tantra" also says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"By the influence of mantras in Tretaa, vimaanas 
are of maantrika type. Owing to the prevalence of tantras in Dwaapara, 
the vimaanas are of taantrika type. Owing to decadence of both mantra 
and tantra in Kaliyuga, the vimaanas are of artificial type." Thus 3 
classes of vimaanas are mentioned in shaastras by ancient seers.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In "Yantra Kalpa" also,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"Vimaanas are classified into mantra and other 
varieties by experts according to differences in yugas. They are defined
 as maantrika, taantrika, and kritaka."</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The same is expressed in "Kheta yaana pradeepika," and also "Vyoma Yaana Arkaprakaashikaa."</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 87</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Thus according to shaastras vimaanas are divided into 3 classes, on the basis of differences in the modes of their manufacture.</font></p>

holes. The wheels above and below should be fixed with bolts, and 
unmoving. In order to revolve the middle wheel keys should be fixed 
outside on the mast, As there are holes in the wheels, as two wheels do

<p><font face="Arial">Beneath the ground-floor board a 7 feet high 
cellar should be constructed. In it the several necessary yantras should
 be located. In the centre is the foot of the hollow mast. On the four 
directions from it 4 air pumping machines should be fixed. In order to 
stimulate them 4 steam engines also should be installed. On the two 
sides of the vimaana two air expelling machines, and an air heater 
machine, and 2 machines to keep the heater supplied with air from 
outside, should be erected.</font></p>

and width 3 feet. The naalaas or pipes should be 3 feet wide, and their 
outer circumference should be 4 feet. The rods and hinges and other 
equipment should be suitably prepared.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The vaatapaa yantra or air blower should be 12 
feet long and 9½ feet wide. Inside it should be covered with circling 
wires. A pipe should be fixed inside, for air flow. By the hot oil fumes
 from the heated tank, the air becomes heated and should be passed into 
the owshmya yantra or heater, while the cold air from outside should 
also be let in. Tubes and fixings should be provided in the yantra. In 
order to emit the fumes of the oil flames to the outside, a 6 inches 
pipe should be fixed from the yantra to the foot of the mast. Air 
blowers should be installed with 10 feet wheels to pump in fresh cold 
air from outside.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">To the east of the air machine should be placed a 
light burner in order to aid combustion of the oil. An electric 
generator provided with switches should light the burner. When the light
 is off the oil should be kept duly sealed. A rope should be tied to the
 tail joint, for the pilot to manipulate the fluttering of the tail to 
help the ascent or descent of the vimaana. Similarly ropes should be 
tied to the hinges of the two wings, and passed to the pilot like reins,
 so that he might spread them out or close them as needed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Ten feet beneath the passenger floor of the 
vimaana, to a height of 2½ feet from the bottom plate there should be a 
cellar-like enclosure. The bottom of the vaatanaala mast should be fixed
 in its centre with firm screw joints. In this cellar should be located 
two oil tanks 15 feet by 9½ feet by 4 feet, with water jackets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next Sundara vimaana will be described. It has got 8 constituent parts.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First peetha or ground plate, smoke chimney, 5 
gas-engines, bhujya metal pipe, wind blower, electricity generator, and 
four-faced heater, and vimaana nirnaya, or outer cover.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Peetha or ground plate:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It should be made of Raajaloha metal only. It 
should be square or round, and of 100 feet in circumference, or any 
other desired size. It should be 8 feet thick. Seven times the peetha 
has to be heated with manchuka or madder root oil. Then spots should be 
marked in it at 10 feet distance from each other, totalling 24. The size
 of each kendra or centre is 15 feet. In the centre a dhooma-prasaarana 
or fume distributing naala or pipe 12 feet high should be erected.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Naalastambha, hollow mast:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The naalastambha should be 56 feet high, and 4 
feet in diametre. For storing gas, at its base, a 8 feet long, circular,
 and 4 feet high vessel should be provided. A six feet size water vessel
 should be arranged. A 4 feet size oil tank should be fixed at its 
centre. At its foot an electric storing crystal of 1 foot size should be
 fixed with necessary hinges and keys.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The vessel should be filled with 12 parts of 
dhoomanjana oil, and 20 parts of shukatundika or bignonia Indica? 
(egg-plant?) oil, and 9 parts of kulakee or red-arsenic oil. To conduct 
electricity, two wires should be passed through the pipe and fixed to 
the crystal. In the middle of the naalastambha or mast, for the smoke 
fumes to be restrained or speeded out, triple wheels with holes should 
be fixed. In order to work the wheels from outside, two right turning 
and left turning wheels</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 95</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">should be attached outside the pole, and connected
 to the wheels inside. Three wires should be drawn inside the naala and 
fixed at the foot, the middle, and at the top.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Dhoomodgama Yantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Because it ejects smoke fumes with speed it is called Dhoomodgama yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Hima samvardhaka, soma, and sundaala, in the 
proportion of 32, 25, and 38, should be filled in pipe crucible, placed 
in chakra-mukha furnace, and with the help of ajaamukha bellows heated 
to 712 degrees and properly churned. It will yield excellent 
dhooma-garbha alloy. With that alloy the dhoomodgama yantra should be 
constructed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Underneath the centre of the 15 feet long peetha, 
for the control of the gas fumes a 10 feet high pipe with right 
revolving wheel should be fixed. On its 2 sides, to south and north, 2 
water steam pipes should be erected. At the foot of the 2 pipes 4 feet 
long 3 feet high pots should be formed for containing the fumes. Two 
pipes shaped like goblets, 1 foot by 8 feet by 3 feet, should be fixed 
at the top of the fume container. A water vessel at its foot, and an 
oil-vessel at its centre, and in front of it the switches of the 
electric ray crystals, as in the dhooma prasaarana naala stambha.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">On either side of the heat tube, two water jackets
 should be placed. A pipe with wires should be taken from the electric 
generator and connected to the hinges of the crystals. Electric current 
of 80 linkas should be passed to the crystals, whose motion will cause 
friction and generate heat of 100 degrees (kakshyas). Thereby the oil in
 the vessel will get heated and boil and emit fumes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The electric power should then be passed through 
the smoke pipe between the two water jackets. By this the water will be 
converted into hot steam. The oil fumes should be filled in the oil fume
 pipe and the steam in the steam pipe. Then by operating the switches, 
both the fumes will fly up at 500 degree temperature. The switches 
should restrain the fumes or pump them out as needed. 40 such yantras 
should be prepared and should be fixed on the peetha in groups on</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 96</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">the four sides. Then connected with the bases of 
the dhooma-naalas, sundaalas or elephant trunks, one foot wide and 12 
feet high should be erected on the four sides, to enable the vimaana to 
fly with speed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Sundaala is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#18">

<p><font face="Arial">The sundaala should be installed. for using the 
oil fumes and steam fumes for the motion of the vimaana. There are. 
varieties of ksheera vrikshaas or milk-trees according to shaastraas. 
Vata or banyans, manjoosha or madder root, maatanga or citron?, 
panchashaakhee (five branched), shikhaavalee (crested), taamra 
sheershnee (copper-crested), brihatkumbhee (big bellied), mahishee, 
ksheeravallaree, shona parnee (crimson-leaved), vajramukhee, and 
ksheerinee (milky). From these the ooze or milk should be collected, and
 in the proportion of 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 8, 7, 4, 7, 30, 12, filled in a 
vessel. Then granthi metal, naaga or lead, vajra, bambhaarika, vynateya,
 kanduru, kudapa, and kundalotpala, these in equal parts should be 
filled in the vessel in equal proportion to the milk contents, and 
boiled with 92 degree heat. Then the molten liquid should be filled in 
the milk-cloth machine, and churned. When cooled and put through the 
levelling machine, it will yield a strong, soft, cool, heat proof, and 
uncuttable ash-coloured cloth sheet.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">This cloth should be boiled in rouhinee taila or 
oil of black hellebore for 3 yaamaas or 9 hours, and then washed with 
water. Then it should be boiled in atasee or linseed oil as before. Then
 it should be kept in ajaa-mootra or goat's urine for one day and kept 
in the sun. Then it should be dried and painted with kanakaanjana paint 
and dried, Then the cloth will glow with a golden hue. With this cloth 
should be made the shundaala or elephant trunk, 12 feet high, 1 foot 
round, and with pipe-like opening inside.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Two mechanisms for rolling it and unrolling it 
should be properly attached to it. By the rolling switch the shundaala 
will coil round like a snake and remain on the floor. By the unrolling 
switch it will uncoil and stand erect like a raised arm. From the fume 
generating yantra connecting links to the shundaala should be provided 
for the fumes to pass through it to the outside air. And to attract 
outside air into the sundaala a pump-like arrangement should be provided
 as in an inflator.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 97</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Three switches should be provided as in the water 
tapping yantra. By revolution of its wheel the fumes will go out through
 the shundaala and 82 linka of fresh air will come in. The direction in 
which the fumes will emerge from the shundaala will be the direction of 
the course of the vimaana. The 3 wheels in the shundaala will cause the 
vimaana to wheel around or make ascent, or to drop height.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">At the foot of each dhoomodgama yantra 2 
shundaalas should be duly fixed. And on the 4 sides of the 
dhoomaprasaarana-naala-stambha 4 shundaalas should be erected.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to protect against the intense heat from 
fire and sun inside and outside the vimaana, it should be provided a 
covering made of the 6th type of Ooshmapaa loha or heat-proof metal. At 
the top and bottom and on the sides keys should be provided for the 
movement of the fumes. 40 such dhoomodgama yantras should be properly 
fixed in the selected spots of the peetha with screw fittings. The 
vimaana will be enabled to fly smoothly by so doing.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" color="#B50400">ELECTRIC DYNAMO</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says Yantra Sarvasva:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">There are 32 kinds of yantras for generating 
electricity, such as by friction, by heating, by waterfall, by 
combination, by solar rays, etc. Out of these, saamyojaka or production 
by combination is the one most suitable for vimaanas. Its manufacture is
 explained by Sage Agastya in Shaktitantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha or foot-plate should be made of 
saamyojaka metal, 35 feet in diametre. 5 spots should be marked in it in
 a circle, 5 feet in diametre, with a spot in the centre. Vessels should
 be prepared for each kendra, 4 feet wide, 2 feet high, shaped like a 
pot. On each a cylindrical pipe 1 foot wide and 1 foot high, should be 
fixed. The top of the cylinder should be 4 feet wide and round.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then get a Jyotirmukha or flame-faced lion's skin,
 duly cleaned, add salt, and placing in the vessel containing 
spike-grass acid, boil for 5 yaamas or 15 hours. Then wash it with cold 
water. Then take</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 98</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">oils from the seeds of jyothirmukhee, or 
staff-tree, momordica charantia, and pot herb, in the proportion of 3, 
7, and 16, and mix them in a vessel, add 1/64 part of salt. The skin 
should be immersed in this oil and kept for 24 days in solar heat. It 
will get a scarlet sheen. The skin should be cut to the size of the top 
opening of the vessel cylinder, with 5 openings in it. Cover the 
cylinder with the skin with bolts. All the 5 vessels should be similarly
 covered, and placed in the 5 selected centres on the peetha. Then 16 
drona measures of asses' urine, 16 linka measures of mined charcoal, 3 
linkas of salt, 2 linkas of snake-poison, and 2 linkas of copper, should
 be filled in the vessel on the eastern side.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then in the vessel on the western side, 7 
vidyudgama mani or load-stone, 13 praana-kshaara or ammonium chloride, 
22 hare-dung, should be filled. and made into a decoction. Two parts of 
camel urine should be mixed with one part of the above. Then 50 linkas 
of rhinoceros bones, 30 linkas of sulphur, and 16 linkas of tamarind 
tree salt, and 28 linkas of steel should be added to that. And 117 
tatin-mitra manis should be placed in the centre of the vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next the following materials should be filled in the northern vessel:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Eleven parts of oil of apaamaarga or achyranthus 
aspera seeds, 32 parts of oil seeds of sarpaasya or mesua ferrea, 40 
parts of ayaskaantha or oil of steel, in 83 parts of elephant's urine, 
all these to be put in the northern vessel and mixed together properly. 
Then add mercury, symhika salt, and paarvanika or bamboo rice, 30, 20, 
and 25 palas respectively, or 120, 80, and 100 tolas. Sun-crystal of the
 800th type, mentioned in Maniprakarana, cleaned in oil, should be put 
in the vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Next in the vessel on the southern side, put in 
grandhika draavaka or long-pepper decoction, panchamukhee draavaka, and 
shveta-punja or white liquorice decoctions, in proportion of 12, 21, and
 16, and mix together, add cows' urine 5 parts more than the above 
liquids, 47 parts of jyotirmayookha root, 28 linkas of kaanta metal, 
28th and 10th kind of kudupa 32 parts. 92 jyotirmanis purified in milk 
should be placed in it, according to Chaakraayani. This is the southern 
vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then in the central vessel electric current should be stored. That vessel should be made of chapala-graahaka metal only.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 99</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Chapala-graahaka metal is explained in Lohatantra:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Quick-lime, marble stone, lac, sowraashtra earth, 
glass, root of the elephant trunk tree, bark of karkata tree, cowries, 
cubeb pepper gum, in the proportion of 8, 11, 7, 27, 8, 5, 3, 7, and 12 
parts of tankana or borax, to be filled in urana crucible, placed in 
kundodara furnace, and with 3 faced bellows, boiled to 427 degrees, will
 yield, when poured into the cooler and cooled, chapalagraahaka metal.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The electricity storage vessel should be 
manufactured as follows: A foot-plate 5 feet long, 8 feet high, 1 foot 
thick, half-moon shaped, should be made of above metal. The vessel 
should be shaped like a big pot, with a cylindrical top. It should have a
 glass covering. 2 pipes 3 feet wide 6 feet high should be fixed in the 
vessel in the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#19"><font color="#0000DE">northern</font></a>
 and southern sides. They should also be covered with glass. Between the
 two pipes two wheels with hinges and switches etc. should be fixed. 
When the switches are put on or turned, causing the two wheels to 
revolve, electricity will flow from the bottom of the 4 vessels into the
 two pipes and ascend. Two tubes, 6 inches long, should be prepared, 
wound round with deer skin, tied with silk thread or silk cloth. The 
Vajramukhee copper wires cleaned with acids, should be passed through 
each tube, and taken to the two pipes in the vessel and be fixed with 
glass cups. 8 palas or 32 tolas of mercury should be placed in the 
energy container vessel. 391st vidyunmukha mani, wound round with copper
 wiring with mixing switch, should also be inserted. Then taking the 
wires in the pipes they should be connected with the wiring of the mani 
through the kaachakanku hole. In each of the vessels, excepting the 
middle one, two churning rods should be fixed in the centre. The rods 
should be made of steel or shakti skandha. They should be 3 feet high 
and 1 foot thick. Keys should be fixed in them for obverse and reverse 
churning. To the east of the churning machine wheels should be fixed for
 raising and lowering. An 8 inches high naala or tube should be fixed. 
On either side of it should be fixed 5 wheels of 5 inches height, like 
the wheel of the water lifting machine. 2 inches wide flat pattis made 
of shakti skandha metal should be passed from the wheels inside the 
Aavritta-naala to the keys of the wheels in the churning yantra. Then 
revolving wheels should be attached to the naalas or tubes of the 
stambha or big pipe. By the turning of these keys, it will operate like 
the turning of the churning</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 100</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">rod back and forth as in churning curds by drawing and relaxing the rope ends.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then according to Darpana-shaastra, four vessels, 
shaped like the bamboo cylinder used on the pounding mortar, should he 
made out of ghrinyaakarshana glass or solar-heat absorbing glass and 
fixed on the mouth of the 4 vessels.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The vessel is described by Lallaacharya: 8 inches 
wide and 1 foot high, and then 2 feet wide and 6 feet high, and at the 
top a 6 feet wide mouth.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">25 palas or 100 tolas of bamboo salt, should be 
put in it. Then amsupaa mani or solar-ray crystal of the 325th kind, 
duly cleaned in acid, should be put in it with rice salt. Then rice hay 
should be spread over it tightly, and facing the sun. The rays from all 
sides are imbibed by them, and will enter the vessel daily to 105 
degrees' strength. If kept thus in the sun for 12 days, 1080 linkas of 
electric power will be accumulated in each vessel.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to store this power in the storage vessel
 six inches long steel tubes should connect the bottom of the vessel 
with the storage vessel. They should be covered by deer skin and wound 
round with silk cloth or yarn. Two copper wires should be passed through
 the tubes and connected to the storage vessel. 100 palas of mercury 
should be put in the vessel. And a 391th type of sun crystal duly wired 
should be placed in the mercury, and the wires coming from the tubes 
should be connected to it.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The well-oiled keys in the 4 vessels should be 
revolved with speed, to 200 degrees heat, when the liquids in the 
vessels will be boiled by the heat rays. Then the keys should be 
hastened up to 2000 degrees. By the liquids in each vessel 800 linkas of
 electricity will be generated. The power should be conveyed by the 
wires in the kaanta metal tubes to the storage vessel. The crystal will 
absorb and fill the vessel with the power. In front of the storage 
vessel a five feet long, 3 feet high circular vessel should be 
installed. It should be covered all round with the bark of 
vaari-vriksha.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 101</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Always water will be flowing in it. So instead of 
water, water skin is indicated. It will give the vessel the effect of 
water-immersion. Then in that vessel glass cups containing the decoction
 of shikhaavalee or lead-wort? or achyranthes aspera?, 18 parts of 
ayaskaanta or loadstone? or steel acid?, and 12 parts of vajrachumbaka 
acid, should be placed. Then power should be drawn from the storage 
vessel through the wires inside the glass-covered tube, and 4 wires with
 glass wheel key be let into the acid vessels. Then from the bottom of 
the vessels 2 wires fitted with keys should be taken in a right circle 
to the front of the smoke-outlet stambha or pipe, and attached to the 
wires inside the bhujyu metal tube. The wires should also be connected 
to the keys of the electric friction crystals in the dhoomodgama stambha
 or pillar, as also to the key in the stambha. Thereby electricity will 
be spread in all parts of the vimaana. Therefore the vidyud-yantra or 
electrical machine should be installed in the left side of the vimaana.</font></p>

 quick motion, or left at rest. By turning the keelakas the piston rod 
is moved, and from its speed, the bellows' mouth also will start in 
motion, and also the vaataakarshana naala. By putting the naala at the 
mouth of the bhastrika or bellows, quick air entry from inside the mouth
 will occur. By starting all the keelakaas in all the centres there will
 be airflow in the three wheel tubular stambhas. By turning the</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 103</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">keelakas with 20 heat-degree force, in the naala 
stambhas air will rush out with 100 shaker speed. From the bellows' 
mouth also air will blow with 2000 prenkhana or shaker speed. And these 
air flows will speed the motion of the vimaana. Therefore in front of 
the vaatodgama yantra 12 such yantras should be installed on the four 
sides, 3 on each side. And aavarana or covering should be provided for 
them according to their measurements. And 12 naala stambhas, 3 feet wide
 and 12 feet high, should be prepared, and fixed on the top covering of 
the yantras, for the air to flow out. From each stambha air will blow 
with 2600 prenkhana speed. The yantras are individually prescribed so 
that some may rest when not required. The high flight will be helped by 
these machines. Having thus described the individual sources of air 
supply for the vimaana, we shall now describe the Brihat-stambha or main
 mast.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It should be 4 feet wide and 30 feet high, and 
called vaatodgama naala stambha. It should be erected centrally amidst 
all the yantras. The bhastrikonmukha yantras should be fixed at the foot
 of the stambha so that the air flows from the yantras could pass into 
the stambha. The wind-naalaas or pipes should be connected to the 
stambha-moola fitted with keys. At the opening of the naala-stambha at 
the top on the 8 inch wide opening a vessel one foot high and 3 feet 
wide should be fixed. The wind from the stambha or tunnel will pass out 
through it in wavy billows. The dhoomodgama yantra or smoke pipe should,
 be provided with triple keys or fixtures, for the expulsion of smoke. 
and blowing in of air. By operating those keelakas the supply of smoke 
and air could be controlled according to need. Wind expelling fan wheels
 should be put in, so that by their quick motion the motion of the 
vimaana could be facilitated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Covering the dhoomodgama yantras and kudyaas or 
side walls, as in the case of the Shakuna Vimaana, the covering of the 
Sundara vimaana should be done by raajaloha only. The covering should 
accommodate the number of partitions or booths required as in Shakuna 
Vimaana. The location of the 32 component yantras should be determined.</font></p>

 In the centre of the booths for locating the four-faced heat machinery,
 a thirty feet square area should be set apart.. There the four-faced 
heat yantra should be erected.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Says Yantrasarvasva:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The chaatur-mukha owshnya yantra should be made out of kundodara metal only. Kundodara metal is defined in Lohasarvasva.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Soma, Kanchuka, and shundaala metals in the 
proportion of 30, 45, and 20 to be taken, cleaned and filled in padma 
crucible, placed in chhatramukha furnace, and with vaasukee bellows 
heated to 716 degrees, aa-netraanta, and poured into the yantra for 
cooling. A blue, fine, light, alloy, capable of bearing 2000 degree 
heat, and which cannot be blasted even by shataghnee and sahasraghnee 
canons, and very cold, is kundodara alloy. With this alloy the owshnyaka
 yantra should be fashioned.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Yantraangas or parts of the Machine.</font></p>

speedometer, time clock, ravaprasaarana keelaka naala or sound 
transmitting instrument, antardandaaghaata naala, air-bellows, long 
sundaala pipes, twin copper pipes, air dividing wheel keys, these 18 
parts constitute the ooshmyaka yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha, tortoise-shaped, should be 25 feet 
long and wide. At peethaadi or starting end should be fixed the 
agni-kosha or fire place, the water vessel in the middle, and the 
smoke-container should be fixed at the other end.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The 3 koshaas are explained by Budila:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Ravi or copper, manchoulika, and tigma in equal 
parts should be mixed with kundodara metal, and be made into 3 inches 
thick pattika or flats. One pattika should be fixed on the peetha. In 
the fire place, kendra on the peetha a 4 feet long 6 feet high 
fire-place should be made. For stocking coal or wooden billets, a sort 
of walled table should be formed. Next a triangular fire-place should be
 formed,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 105</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">with rods at the bottom for the ashes to fall 
down. In between the 2 parts the flat sheet should be fixed, fitted with
 keelakas or hinges for moving the peetha as desired. Three keelakas 
should be fixed at the fire place, one to fan the flames and straighten 
them, one to moderate or stimulate the flames, and one to distribute the
 flames evenly. A naala or pipe should be fixed on the fire kosa. 
Another pipe with wiring, is to be fixed at the end of the fire-kosa 
pattika with a smoke transmitting pipe which will convey the smoke of 
the fire-place to the jalakosa or water container. From the fire kosa to
 the covering of the water kosa water pipes should be adjusted. In the 
water kosa enclosure the heat will rise to 5000 linkas in these tubes. 
The heated water will then give out hot smoke.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The size of the jalakosa or water container is 8 
feet. Three triple-wheeled naalas or pipes should be fixed in the 
jalakosa: one to restrain the heated smoke from the water, one to amass 
the smoke, and one to lead the smoke into the dhoomakosa or 
smoke-container. The Dhoomakosa should be 6 feet wide and 4 feet high. 
In order to fill the kosha with smoke, necessary fittings should be 
provided. Above the jalakosa a dome-like covering should be erected. It 
should be provided with fittings, for folding up and opening out. To the
 front of the smoke container, two pattikaa wheels with holes should be 
fixed in order to let out the smoke or to restrain it. In order to 
operate the wheels two bhraamanee keelakaas or revolving switches should
 be provided. To the east of the Dhooma-kunda, 8 inches long window bars
 should be fixed with one inch spacings. Then in front of the yantra, in
 the middle, at top, at bottom, and on both sides, twin padmachakra 
keelakas should be fixed for spreading the smoke or restraining it. For 
storing the wood or coal a hole 11 feet wide should be arranged. The 
door covering it should be provided with needful fittings. To the north 
and south of the keelaka the heat-measure and speedometer should be 
fixed. Above them the timepiece. To the south, a telephonic device 
called ravaprasaarana or sound ringer, which will give alarm with 1212 
sound wave speed, and which gives warnings for the plane's moving, 
halting, speeding, overspeeding, and danger imminence. An equipment with
 5 holes giving 5 different sounds to indicate the above should be 
installed. On either side of the above, two 6 inches wide, 26 feet tall,
 Aaghaatha-naalas or pipes should be fixed. Between them two 5 inches 
thick metal rods are to be adjusted. At the foot, middle, and top of the
 naalas revolving</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 106</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">wheel keelakas should be fitted. By their 
revolving, the rods will strike each other. That will increase the speed
 of the plane. On the top of the naala pipes, air bellows with fittings 
should be fixed. Thereby the air force in the naalas will shoot up, and 
the speed of the vimaana will double. Then on the four sides of the 
heated smoke kosha or container, shundaalas or elephant-trunk-like pipes
 should be fixed with wheeled keys as in vaatodgama yantra. By filling 
the shundaalas with the smoke and turning the keys as required, the 
movement of the vimaana in one direction or another, its gaining height 
and speeding out or halting, will be facilitated. Keys should be 
adjusted so as to make the shundaalas coil down like a water hose or 
keep erect. Two pipes made of 3rd division copper should he wound round 
the agnikosa, water kosa, and smoke kosa, or fire, water and smoke 
koshas, in order to absorb the excessive heat in them.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to part the wind in front of the vimaana, vaata-vibhajana chakra keela or wind-dividing-wheel fittings should be fixed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having thus prepared the chaaturmukhoshmyaka 
yantra, or four-faced heating machine, it should be installed in the 
centre of the vimaana. By the air, smoke, and heat of the yantras below,
 the ascent and flight of the vimaana will be facilitated.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Regarding the speed of the vimaana, we have to 
consider the speed of smoke and other accessories mathematically, and 
conclude the possibility of the speed of the vimaana. The speed of the 
smoke from dhooma yantra is 2113 linkas. The speed of wind from the air 
blowing machine 2500 linkas. Wind from the naala-stambha blows at the 
speed of 600 linkas. This is the speed of the forces from the 3 machines
 on the peetha. Of the forces from the upper portion of the vimaana, 
from the chatur-mukhoshmyaka yantra, heat force of 3400 linkas emanates.
 By the four-faced heat yantra, and by operating the keys of the 
shundaalas, and the force of the wind, smoke and heat machines, the 
vimaana would be capable of a speed of 400 yojanas or 3600 miles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">"Yaana-Bindu" says,</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">"After first producing golden colour for Raajaloha, the vimaana should be formed."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That will be Raajaloha, pure, golden-coloured,

very beautiful and delightful.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">The Peetha</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The peetha or ground plate of the Rukma vimaana 
should be tortoise-shaped, 1000 feet long, and 1 foot thick, or any 
other desired</font></p>

 they should be made round like a grind-stone. They should be inserted 
in the beaks at the 8 centres. From each chakra-pinda up to the

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Or Button-switch pole</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">One foot wide and 4 feet high poles should be 
fixed. They should have switches wired up to the electric pole. 8 inches
 wide wheels should be fixed in the middle of the pole, on either side, 
with wires. From the electric pole chain wires should enclose the wheels
 and be fixed in another pole with inside hinges. On the top of the 
poles should be fixed goblet shaped cups with button-switches like 
half-blooms with wheels and keys, so that on pressing the button with 
the thumb the wheels in the other pole will revolve from electric 
contact. Then the wheels in the electric pole will also revolve, 
producing 5000 linkas of speed.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">Flying</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Due to this electrical force, the ayah-pinda 
wheels beneath the peetha will beat against it and make it rise and move
 upwards. And by moving the switches of the wheeled poles above the 
peetha, the poles will revolve with speed, and accelerate the speed of 
the vimaana. By the concussion of the wheels underneath, and the action 
of the poles above, the vimaana will move upwards and gain height and 
fly with dignity.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Electric tube wheels aiding flight:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Above the peetha, naalas or tubes should be fixed 
at 1 foot intervals. On both sides of each naala toothed wheels 2 feet 
wide and 1 foot high should be fixed with proper keelakas. Taking 
electric wires through</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">the keelakas, and passing over the wheels and 
reaching the foot of each naala, they should be attached to wheels 3 
feet wide and 3 feet high. In the midst of 20 naalas a pole should be 
fixed in the centre.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Narayana says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Preparing a pillar 4 feet wide and 4 feet high, 
and making a 2 feet opening in its middle, fix keelakas at the top, 
middle, and lower end of the opening. Two keelakas with 6 wheels, with 
glass coverings, with wires, and naala and leather covering should be 
fixed at the lower end for attracting electricity. In the middle part of
 the opening, for transmitting the current, a five-faced keelaka should 
be fixed, with 5 wheels, glass covering, 2 naala tubes, two wires, 
attached to 3 rods, and vessel containing veginee oil. By the flow of 
the current the wheels in the upper end should be made to whirl by 
properly adjusting keys. In front of the opening a big wheel should be 
fixed with gumbha keelakas. Similarly wheels should be fixed at the foot
 of each pillar. On top of them a four inch wide pattika or flat band 
should be adjusted commencing from the samsarga key chakra up to the 
front of the electric yantra. By operating that key, power will flow 
through the wires, and entering the key at the foot of the pillar set 
the wheels in motion. On the motion of the big wheel the sandhi-wheels 
in the naala-dandas will also revolve with speed, and the current will 
enter the 5 faced keelaka, and entering the oil vessel it will gather 
force, and passing through the 2 naalas, set all the wheels in the 
pillar in forceful motion, generating 25000 linkas speed, which will 
give the vimaana 105 krosa or nearly 250 miles speed per ghatika, or 24 
minutes.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having dealt with the mechanism for setting the 
vimaana in motion, we now consider the mechanism for giving direction to
 the vimaana in its course. In the 8 diks or directions of the peetha, 
pillars made of mica and shining like panchakantha, 2 feet thick and 15 
feet high should be fixed at intervals of 10 feet. On the pillars should
 be built the passenger seating arrangements, and booths or locations 
for the machinery, as in the case of the Sundara Vimaana. The pillars 
should be made of mica only.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Its production is given in Kriyaasaara:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Shaara-graava or lime 25 parts, kshwinkaasatva or 
iron-sulphate 30 parts, gunja or wild-liquorice 28 parts, tankana or 
borax 12 parts,</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 110</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">roudree moola 8 parts, chaandree or

or mica 100 parts,, to be filled in koorma crucible, and heated in 
paadma furnace with blower to 800 degrees, and then poured into the 
cooler, will yield mica alloy most useful and attractive. Fashioning the
 pillars or walls or partitions and booths, and fixing the mechanisms 
for turning, circling, diving, and manoeuvring, in the fore and middle 
and aft of the vimaana, it could be moved in any direction as desired.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Lallaacharya says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to make the vimaana change its course 
from one path to another or one direction to another, revolving keelakas
 should be fixed on the eight sides of the vimaana. Two keelakas should 
be made, purva and apara, or right side and left side. They should be 
fitted together.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">By operating it, the vimaana could be made to 
change its course one way or another. In order to operate the keelaka, 
at the peetha moola, on the 4 sides crescent shaped naalaas or tubes, 2 
feet wide and 2 feet high should be fixed. 4 inches long metal rods 
should be fixed inside the naalaas on either side. One foot wide and 1 
foot high wheels should be fixed in them. They should be wired all 
around. Such crescent naalas should be fixed on the 4 sides of the 
peetha. In order to set the wheels in the naalas in motion big wheels 
should be fixed at the beginning, middle, and end of the naalas. By 
turning the top wheel with speed the wheels inside the naalas will 
revolve. That will force the keela-shankus to twist round so as to force
 the vimaana to change its course in the required direction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having explained the vimaanas commencing from Shakuna to Simhikaa, Tripura vimaana will now be dealt with.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">This vimaana has 3 enclosures, or aavaranas or 
tiers. Each aavarana is called "Pura." As it consists of 3 aavaranas it 
is called "Tripura" vimaana. It is operated by the motive power 
generated by solar rays.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Narayana also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The vimaana which naturally can travel on land, sea, and in the sky by alteration of its structure is called Tripura Vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It has got 3 parts. The first part can travel on 
land. The second part can travel under and over water. The 3rd part 
travels in the sky. By uniting the 3 parts by means of keelakas, the 
plane can be made to travel in the sky. The plane is divisible into 3 
parts so that it might travel on land, sea, or air. The construction of 
the 1st part is now explained. Tripura vimaana should be made out of 
Trinetra metal only.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Trinetra loha is explained by Shaakataayana:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Jyotishmatee loha 10 parts, kaanta-mitra 8 parts,

maandalika 5 parts, ruchaka or natron 3 parts, mercury 3 parts, then 
filled in crucible in padmamukha furnace and heated to 631 degrees with 
trimukhee bellows, the resulting liquid, if poured into cooler, will 
yield a metal, shining like peacock feather, unburnable, unbreakable, 
weightless, impregnable by water, fire, air and heat, and 
indestructible.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">With that metal the peetha should be prepared, of

 on the western side, at intervals of 10 feet 80 spots should be marked 
for wheeled boats. 80 feet long, 3 feet wide, 5 feet high boat shaped 
dronies or containers should be fixed on the marked lines. Three feet 
wide openings should be made in the top of the dronies, so as to raise 
the wheel inside them quickly and cover them underneath. There should be
 fittings which enable the wheels to be lowered on land, and raised and 
covered underneath when going in water. The wheels should have axle rods
 with fittings to attract electric power. The axle rods should be 2½ 
feet long and 1 foot thick. The wheels should be 3 feet wide and 1 foot 
thick, have, 5, 6, or 7 spokes, fixed in the rims, and covered with 
musheeka up to 4 inches from the edge. Holes with glass coverings should
 be made in all the wheels. These 12 wheels, or 8, or 6, or 4, should be
 fixed inside the boat-like structure. For transmitting power wires made
 of somakaanta loha should be fixed in the holes made in the wheels. In 
the middle of each wheel electric aaghaata keelakaas should be fixed, 
and in them chhidraprasaarana keelakas. Over all the chakradronee boats,
 copper wire pairs should be fixed on both sides, and in the joints of 
the wheels. Rods should be attached to the wires so that power could be 
drawn from the wires and passed to the top of the wheels. And power 
should be passed to the wires underneath the wheels. In climbing hills, 
and going down slopes, by adjusting the power at the top or the bottom 
of the wheels, smooth progress is made possible. By adjusting the 
necessary keelakas it is possible to accelerate the speed, or in going 
down, to restrain the flow of the current, and put brake on excess 
speed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">For attracting power from the generator a naala or
 pipe with wires should be fixed at the front of the peetha through 5 
faced wheel keelakas, and the wires should be connected to the fittings 
at the top and bottom of the wheels, with glass cups.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to put covering over the boat formations,
 pillars should be fixed between each boat line, and covered with mica 
sheets, as per architectural rules.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mica is described in "Dhatu sarvasva ". There are 
four kinds of mica, white mica, red mica, yellow mica, and black mica. 
The white mica has 16 varieties. Red mica has 12 varieties. The yellow

are 50 varieties in all.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Shownakeeya also says:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">We shall now describe the nature of abhraka or 
mica. They are of 4 castes, like brahmin, kshatriya, vysya, and sudra. 
They are of 50 varieties. The brahmin mica has 16 varieties. The 
kshatriya mica has 12 varieties. The vysya mica has 7 varieties. And the
 sudra mica has 15 varieties, totalling 50 in all. Their names are as 
follows. The brahmin mica varieties are ravi, ambara, bhraajaka, 
rochishmaka, pundareeka, virinchika, vajragarbha, koshambara, 
sowvarchala, somaka, amritanetra, shytyamukba, kuranda, rudraasya, 
panchodara and rukmagarbha. The kshatriya varieties are shundeeraka, 
shambara, rekhaasya, owdumbara, bhadraka, panchaasya, amshumukha, 
raktanetra, manigarbha, rohinika, somaamshaka, and kourmika. The vysya 
varieties are krishnamukha, shyaamarekha, garalakosha, panchadhaara,

<p><font face="Arial">Out of these, pundareeka from the 1st class, 
rohinika from the second, panchadhaara from the third, and drownika from
 the 4th class are good for use in constructing the vimaana. These 
should first be purified as per rules.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The process of purification is given in "Samskaara
 Ratnaakara": skandhaaraka or salt of roitleria tinctoria?, shaaranika 
or rubus salt?, pinjulee or yellow orpiment?, cowries, borax, 
kaakajanghaa or wild</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 114</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">liquorice?, moss, rowdrikaa, salt-petre, 
douvaarika, shambara or benzoin, and phosphorus. These should be 
separately filled in the smelter. The decoctions should be filled in 
glass vessels. The mica is to be purified with each one of these.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The mica is to be powdered, put in skandhaavaara 
acid in smelting vessel. It should be boiled for 3 days in fire, and for
 3 days in electric heat. Then take the liquid and put it in a bronze 
vessel, pour in shaaranika acid and keep it in sun for 3 days. Then add 
pinjulee acid and keep buried in earth for 5 days. Afterwards add cowri 
acid, and boil in bhoodhara yantra for one day. Then add mustard, and 
adding borax acid and burning arjuna, myrabolan wood, place it in 
brown-barked acacia cinders for 3 days. Then add wild liquorice acid and
 expose it to the full moon rays on the 14th and 15 days. The mica is to
 be then taken out and washed in hot water. Then add wild corn, and 
pouring in moss acid place it under earth for 6 days. Then take out the 
mica, add roudri acid, place the vessel in a big fire-place, and burn in
 64 feet of dried cowdung. Next taking out the mica put it in sesamum 
oil for 1½ days, and expose to the sun from morning to sundown. Then 
take out the mica, wash it clean, put in bronze vessel with salt-petre 
solution with dattoori or yellow thistle seeds, place it in a heap of 
burning kundalee or mollugo stricta leaves. Then take out the mica, add 
dourvaarika acid and bake for a day with hay-fire. Then put the mica in 
benzoin acid for 3 days. Next add one-fourth as much of camphor, and 
placing it in the churning machine, churn for a day. Then placing it in 
Simhaasya crucible cook with boiling water. Add ranjaka or phosphorus 
acid, 3 palas or 12 tolas of tankana or borax, 12 tolas of lime, 4 tolas
 of soorana root or tacca, karkotaka 20 tolas, vrishala or onion 28 
tolas, koorma-tankanaka 8 palas or 32 tolas, rouhinaka or red sandal 40 
tolas, shambara 80 tolas, muchukunda 12 tolas. These cleaned and filled 
in the crucible, and placed in simhamukha furnace filled with charcoal, 
and melted with 800 degrees heat will yield a metal shining like a 
precious stone, very light, unbreakable, unburnable and indestructible.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">With that the vimaana is to be constructed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">We shall now consider the parts of the vimaana: 2 
feet thick and 3 feet high pillars, painted in different colours and 
adorned with</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 115</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">pictures, should be prepared, and 80 of them 
should be fixed in the spaces between the boats. On the pillars 10 feet 
wide pattikas or sheets, and of the same length as the boats, should be 
fitted with screws, and two-faced hinges.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to accommodate crew and passengers of the
 vimaana, and store luggage, rooms and partitions should be constructed 
with decorations. In order to provide secrecy, doors should be provided 
as also ventilators. Revolving wheels with necessary fittings and 
switches should be fixed so that by putting on a switch the rooms would 
revolve. Wheels should be fixed in the lanes between the boats. 
Air-pipes with wheels should be fixed. In order to ensure supply of air,
 tubes with wheels, and bellows with wide mouths, leaving 20 junctional 
centres, should be fixed. In the front, two faced tubular wheels should 
be fixed to dispel the air downwards or upwards or side ways, at 30 feet
 intervals from the aavrutta or enclosed pradesha of the vimaana. At the
 bottom of the vimaana metal balls with chain-wirings should be fixed 
for operations in the course of flight.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The 1st floor will be 7 feet high, with the 
roofing duly fixed with nalikaa-keelakas with 10 feet intervals. With 20
 feet interval in the middle, wires with beaked ends should be attached 
to each keela. The fittings should be such as to enable opening and 
shutting like an umbrella. The cloth covering like a tent top should 
cover the entire floor.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The second aavarana should be made of trinetra metal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Having described the first floor above, now the 
second floor is being described. The second floor should be slightly 
smaller than the first floor. If the first floor is 100 feet wide, the 
second should be 80 feet wide. The floor should be 80 feet wide, and 3 
feet thick, and made of trinetra metal. Its fittings should be like 
those on the first floor, and be duly connected with electric wiring 
from the generator.</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 116</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In order to take the vimaana through water, first 
the wheels at the bottom used for land route should be drawn up, and in 
order to prevent water coming up, the bottom should be completely 
covered up with ksheeree-pata or milk cloth. Four inches thick metal 
rods, 12 inches long, to which wheels 1 foot wide and ½ foot thick, and 
shaped like frog claws, are fixed, should be adjusted on both sides of 
the dronee or boat lines. Similarly in the front portion of the vimaana,
 on both sides two such wheeled rods should be fixed in order to divert 
water, By switching on power the main wheels will revolve, making all 
the wheels revolve, and expelling water, and aiding the progress of the 
vimaana forward.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">For the supply of air inside, on the sides of the 
2nd floor, should be fixed, air pipes 6 inches wide and made of ksheeree
 pata or milk cloth, cleaned with acid, from the partitions in the 1st 
floor upto the top of the vimaana, their tops being covered with 
revolving metal covers, with air sucking pumps worked by power. The air 
so pumped into the pipes will fill both the second and 1st floors, and 
provide air comfort for the crew and passengers of the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Above the roofing of the two floors all round, 
spreading out and closing up keelakas should be fixed. So as to separate
 the floors, foldable chain fittings should be fixed at 10 feet 
intervals. Wires from the electrical generator should be connected to 
the fittings, so that by their operation the floors will be separated, 
and the separated floors simultaneously move on land and in the air.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In the 2nd floor also cabins, partitions and 
seating and doors and windows should be constructed as attractively as 
in the first floor. The enclosing walls of the floor should be 7 feet 
high from its peetha, and half a foot thick. In order to draw electric 
current from the third floor two poles should be erected in the back 
room with transmitter from which wires will pass the current to the 
various fixtures on the floor.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">At the front of the vimaana a mast should be 
erected. At its foot two bells made of bronze should be fixed in order 
to indicate time to the crew and passengers. In every room on the floor 
alarm</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 117</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">chains, as in railways, should be fixed so that 
the occupants may call for help in times of danger. On hearing the call 
the crew will rush to the room and attend to the requirements of the 
passengers. Sound transmitter, image transmitter, direction indicator, 
time-piece, and cold and heat gauges should be installed on either side 
of the floor, with necessary cable connections.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then in order to protect against excessive wind 
currents, storms, and heat-waves, three machines should be installed at 
the back, on either side, and on both sides of the turret.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">They are described in "Yantra Sarvasva" as 
three-faced air protection yantra, solar-blaze conditioning yantra, and 
rain storm protection yantra. Their construction is given here as per 
shaastras.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First, three-faced air force reducing yantra. It must be made of Vaaruna Metal:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Vaaripanka, vishaari, borax, jaalikaa, mango, 
vishodara, vaaripanchaka, kshaarasaptaka, kshona, manjula or madder 
root, godhara, vaarunaasyaka, paarvana or chlorodendrum phlomoides, 
aruna, kaakatunda, bhoodhara, vaarunaabhraka, natron, kundaaleemukha, 
lodhra or benzoin, varikudmala or water flower, shaarikaarasa, 
panchabaanasahodara, lead 5 parts, soorana or tacca, honey 8 parts, 
vaata, kankanikodara, Sunda, anjana or eye-black, kukkutaandaka, 
khaadira or brown-barked acacia, loddhruka, simhikaa-mukha, 
koormajangha, and masoorika or lentil, all these to be cleaned, and 
filled in crucible, placed in padmamukha furnace, and heated to 700 
degrees with 5 faced bellows, poured into equifying yantra and churned, 
will yield a light, smoke-coloured, impregnable vaaruna metal.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then it is to be purified, according to 
"Kriyaasaara." First, place it in shundeera acid (great-leaved 
laburnum?) and boil for 3 days, and then with kuttinee yantra beat it 
into flat pattis, make thick decoction of soorana root or tacca, and 
smear it to 1 inch thickness on it and heat it for 3 yaamaas or 9 hours.
 Then mritsaara, vaagura, opium, should be boiled together for a day. 
The concoctions will become red like lac. The metal patti should be 
smeared with it and heated in the taapana yantra for a yaama or 3 hours.
 Then keep it</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 118</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">in the sun for a day. Then kantaka or small 
caltrap, heranda, dhavalodara, and chaaraka, and gingelly should be 
mixed together, and the oil extracted. The metal should be smeared with 
it and kept in the sun for 3 days, and then heated in the sun for a day.
 Then paste the gum of kankola or cubeb pepper 1 inch thick, and stick 
into it thumb-sized vaatakuthaaraka manis, place in furnace of 
brown-barked acacia and cool for 9 hours. The metal will become like 
diamond.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Out of this a cover should be made for the 
vimaana, with necessary fittings for spreading over and folding up, 
connected with electric wires drawn from inside the vimaana. The charge 
of electricity will permeate all over, as well as the manis on the 
pattika. Three serpent-faced keelakas should be fixed. These will suck 
in the fierce wind as it blows, and belch it out to the upper regions, 
so that the wind force on the vimaana will be curbed, and danger 
therefrom averted.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The rain storm protection yantra should be made of
 crowncha metal. Says "Kriyaasaara", The metal that can destroy the 
dravapraanana force of water is krowncha loha. Therefore the 
varshopasamhaara yantra should be made out of that alone.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Krowncha loha is described in "Mantra Sarvasva" as
 follows: Jyotirmukha or rose-coloured red-wort 8 parts, tryambaka or 
copper 11 parts, humsa-tunda 12 parts, camphor 7 parts, tankana or borax
 8 parts, sand 4 parts, choorna or lime 12 parts, owrwaara or cucumber?,
 ruruka 5 parts, patola or snake-gourd 27 parts, and vaardhyushika or 
sea-foam 1 part, these to be cleaned and placed in crucible, and heated 
in padma furnace to 512 degrees with 3 faced bellows, poured into 
churning yantra, and then cooled, will yield, a metal, honey-coloured, 
light, strong, rain-storm antidote, and heat-impregnated. Extracting oil
 from the seeds of basil, rukma or yellow thistle, punkha, red wort, 
trijataa or bael, and pancha-kantaki or 5 thorny trees, the metal should
 be smeared and heated. The metal is to be made into pattis with 
kuttinee yantra, make pipes out of them 3 feet wide of the same height 
as the vimaana, and fix them properly all around. In front of the 
vimaanaa-avarana also 3 feet high pipes should be fixed with keelakas or
 hinges. The pipes should be smeared with chana or gram decoction 1 inch
 thick. On that vajragarbha decoction or triangular spurge milk should 
be</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 119</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">smeared thrice, which will make it hard as 
diamond. On the pipes, at 12 inches intervals, sinjeeta vajra should be 
smeared and heated by fire. Then thumb-size panchaasya manis which will 
counteract the effects of water, should be imbedded on the smeared 
pipes. Then the pipes with proper fittings at both ends should be fixed 
on the 8 sides of the vimaana. Wires proceeding from the electric 
generator should be taken through glass tube and connected to the pipes.
 When the current passes through them to the panchaasya mani, the 
concentrated force in it blending with the electric force will fiercely 
oppose the forces of the rain storm and disturb the atmosphere so as to 
dilute and weaken the storm, and render it ineffective. Therefore the 
varshopahaaraka yantra should be fixed on the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Sooryaathapopasamhaara yantra or the burning-sun protection machine:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is to be made out of the aathapaashana loha. It
 is explained in Kriyaasaara: Aatapaashana loha protects against burning
 sun. Therefore Aatapa samhaara yantra should be made with that metal. 
"Lohatantra" describes that metal. Owrvaarika, kowshika, gaaruda, 
soubhadraka, chaandrika, sarpanetra, sringaataka, sowmyaka, chitraloha, 
vishvodara, panchamukha, virinchi, these twelve metals should be put in 
equal parts in padma-moosha crucible. Borax 7 parts, chowlika 5 parts, 
cowree salt 6 parts, kunjara 12 parts, sand 9 parts, camphor 4 parts, 
cardamom 16 parts, powshnika 10 parts, should be added to them, and 
placing it in nalikaa furnace heated to 725 degrees with mooshakaasya 
bhastrika bellows. Then the liquid should be put in, the mixing machine,
 and afterwards poured into the cooler. The resulting alloy will be 
light, orange coloured, heat proof, and unbreakable, for the making of 
sooryaathapopasamhaara yantra, after being duly purified, says 
Yantrasarvasva.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kriyaasaara explains its purification:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Ashwaththa or sacred fig tree, mango, plantain, 
aala or banyan, baadava or peepul, trimukhee, trijata or bael, gunja or 
wild liquorice, sherinee, onurberah, patolika or snake gourd, the bark 
of these trees should be powdered, should be filled in vessel with 10 
times as much water, and boiled down to one-tenth measure.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Then taking the 11 kinds of salts, bidaa-lavana or
 table-salt, syndhava or rock-salt, oushara or saline earth, budila 
salt, maacheepatra salt or</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 120</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">solanum indicum?, praanakshaara panchaka, or 5 
urine salts or ammonium chloride? and saamudra or sea-salt, these eleven
 salts, should be placed in dravaakarshana yantra or dehydration machine
 and boiled. Taking the previous decoction, add half as much this 
decoction, put the aatapaashana metal in it and boil for 5 days, then 
wash with water, and anoint with honey, and place in hot sun for 3 days,
 then wash it, and use it for producing the yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">First pattikas should be made from the metal with 
kuttinee yantra, 2 feet square, or circle, and 3 feet thick. On that 3 
pipes, 1 foot wide and 5 feet high, should be fixed. Three triangular 
glass bowls should be placed underneath the pipes. In each of them one 
prastha or seer of somadraavaka or white acacia juice should be filled. 
In each vessel a heat proof crystal of the 121st class should be cleaned
 with acid and placed. Then an umbrella shape 10 feet wide should be 
made out of the metal, and fixed so as to cover the 3 pipes, with 
revolving keelakas fixed half-a-foot underneath the umbrella cover. 
Above that 3 kalasas, 3 feet wide and shaped like cooking vessel, should
 be fixed. At their centre circular chaalapattikas should be fixed. Upon
 that three cold-diffusing crystals of the 185th number, should be 
fixed. On them three black mica wheels should be fixed. They should be 
covered with chandrikaa toolikaa or white silk cotton. On that should be
 placed a vessel with acid of manjoosha or madder root, in which a 
heat-resisting crystal is immersed. In the front part the toothed mica 
wheels fitted with bhraamanee-danda keelakas should be fixed. And in 
order to revolve that keelaka 3 wheeled keelaka should be fixed. By its 
motion the umbrella will revolve disturbing the heat wave. Then the 
heat-absorbing mica wheels will absorb the heat, which, pas-sing down to
 the madder-root acid, will become cold and get extinguished. And the 
crew and passengers will be saved from its evil effects.</font></p>  
<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#B50400">The Third Floor:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">In erecting the 3rd floor of the vimaana, the same
 procedure as was followed in erecting the second floor should be 
followed. Like the fixtures in the flooring of the 2nd aavarana and 
roofing of the 1st aavarana, fixtures should be put in connecting the 
roofing of the 2nd aavarana and the peetha of the 3rd aavarana. The 
peetha of the 3rd floor should be 5 feet less than the peetha of the 2nd
 floor, and be</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 121</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">square or circular like it. The cabins, doors, 
walls, and furniture on the 3rd floor should be on the same lines as in 
the 2nd floor. In the north eastern part of the 3rd floor, a cabin 
should be prepared for housing the electric generator. It should be made
 out of somaanka loha.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Somaanka loha is explained in "Lohatantra" as 
follows: Lead, panchaasya, and copper, 7 parts each, Chumbaka or 
loadstone 9 parts, nalikaa or Indian spikenard bark, sharaanika or rubus
 salt?, and borax, in equal parts, to be filled in sarpamukha crucible, 
and placed in naagakunda furnace, filled with coal, and heated to 353 
degrees with shashamukha bellows. After melting the liquid should be 
filled in the mixer, and after churning be poured out to cool. The 
resulting metal will be a fine, light, electricity-impregnated somaanka 
loha. Out of that metal pattikas should be made with kuttinee yantra, or
 hammering yantra.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">A cradle-like vessel, 3 feet wide and 8 feet high,
 should be made out of it, and be covered with a pattika with hinges. On
 the eastern and northern part of the cover two holes 1½ feet wide 
should be made. The cradle should be fixed in the electric cabin. Below 
the holes, two peethas should be fixed in the cradle. Two vessels 2 feet
 wide and 4 feet high should be prepared. Eight goblets 6 inches wide 
and 1 foot high should be made, and 4 each should be placed in the two 
vessels, in their four corners. In the middle of the 4 goblets, a big 
goblet should be placed so as to contact all the four. 2 vessels covered
 with patties having 5 holes should be placed inside the 2 holes in the 
cradle cover. Teethed churners 5 inches in size, 8 inches in height, 
like those of sugarcane machines, 8 in number, should be placed in the 8
 goblets in the two vessels in the cradle. 2 churners, bigger than these
 should be placed in the two central goblets beneath the two holes. 
Fixtures should be fixed on the central churner so that by their turning
 all the other churners will turn.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The procedure for extracting electricity out of 
solar rays is as follows. 8 naalas or tubes should be prepared out of 
the 192nd kind of amshupa glass. The naalas should be fixed on the 4 
corners of each vessel. Panchamukhi karnikaas should be placed on them, 
filled with rukmapunkhaa shana, and with electric crystals in them. 
Covering them</font></p>  
<p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN" face="Arial">p. 122</font></a></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">with the amshupaa glass cover, 5 spires should be 
formed on it. The top of each spire should be like an open beak, and in 
it should be inserted sinjeeraka crystal and amshupaa crystal. On the 
central spire amshu-mitra mani should be fixed. Above the 4 crystals 
should be fixed 4 glass tubes made of kiranaakarshana glass, 6 inches 
wide and 3 feet high. On them should be carefully fixed 4 
feet-wide-mouthed vessels, acid cleaned. They should be filled with 
Rudrajataa-vaala or aristolochia indica linn. Revolving ghutikas should 
be placed in their centre. The ghutikaas will attract the solar rays and
 send them through the tubes. The crystals in the spire beaks will suck 
them in. So does the shinjeera crystal inside, as also the amshu-mitra 
crystal. The power will be absorbed by the glass-covering, and sent to 
the electric crystal. Then the karnikas inside will receive it and send 
down to the central tube with force. When the central churner revolves 
the other churners also revolve. The power will enter the acid, and the 
crystals in it will whirl with great speed, intensifying the power force

ganapa-yantra in front of the cradle, and stored in the central storage.</font></p>

to the Ganapa image from the neck to the navel. Three-inch toothed 
wheels should be so fixed that a big wheel at the neck of the image, by 
force of the current coming through the trunk or proboscis will whirl, 
setting the other wheels in motion. A coil of wire should be placed in 
the centre. On it a sapta-shashthi shankha or conch called simhikaa 
should be placed, with covering made of kravyaada metal. 5 spoonfuls of 
jeevaavaka acid (ditamine?) should be filled in the conch, and 217</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">bhaamukha graamukha manis or beads should be 
placed inside. 5 umbrellas, 2 inches wide, should be made, and 5 
sun-crystals of the size of big liquorice, should be stuck on them. The 
umbrellas should be fixed on the conch, with amshupa glass covering. 
This should attract the force of the sun rays, and pass to the crystals 
on the umbrellas, making the crystals and the umbrellas whirl with 
fierce force of 1000 linkas, and the force passing to the acid in the 
conch and the crystal inside, will thence pass westwards, and could be 
transmitted through wires for any desired use. To measure its exact 
force a meter should be fixed in, along with thermometer and other 
needful equipments.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" color="#B50400">THE GROUND WHEELS</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial">When the vimaana has to move on the ground, the 
electric current is switched on the electric motor in the hub of each 
wheel, thus causing the rim to revolve and move the vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">But when entering water the wheels are drawn in by
 the movements of toothed segment and the pinion, the latter being 
revolved by an electric motor attached to the shaft. The openings in the
 bottom of the vimaana are closed by the sliding covers moved by the 
rack and pinion arrangement, the pinion being worked by an electric 
motor.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The movements of the hinged joints of the folding links will raise or lower the second floor over the first floor.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h3 align="center">
<font face="Arial" color="#B50400">ELECTRIC GENERATOR</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial">Two jars are placed on the peetha or stand. Each 
jar contains five cups filled with acids. Each cup has a churning rod 
with gear-wheels connected together. The wheels are revolved by hand 
while starting, and by the generated <a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vimanas/vs/errata.htm#21">electric</a>
 power afterwards. A darpana or mirror and gharshana manis are fixed 
above the gear wheels. The darpana and the manis absorb the sun's energy
 and transmit it to the acid cups. The acids, being churned, convert the
 absorbed energy into electric current, which will pass through the 
pancha-mukhee naala, or five-way-switch, to different points, and work 
the machines there.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" color="#B50400">THE ELECTRIC MOTOR</font></h3>  
<p><font face="Arial">The electric motor consists of a loop of fine wire
 coil, with a fine wire cage in the centre. The current from the 
generator is brought to the wire coil through a glass tube. Suitable 
wheels are attached to the wire cage to connect to the churning gears of
 the generator or the shaft of the pinion.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The Simhika shankha on the top of the motor 
contains an acid and the bhaamukha-graahinee mani or crystal. Five rods 
with amshupaamitra manis are fitted to the top of the shankha, and 
toothed wheels are fitted to these rods to revolve together and rub 
against the inner surface of amshupaa mirror at the top. The solar power
 absorbed by the mirror is stored in the shankha, and given out by the 
bhaamukha graahinee mani to the various motors in the vimaana.</font></p>
