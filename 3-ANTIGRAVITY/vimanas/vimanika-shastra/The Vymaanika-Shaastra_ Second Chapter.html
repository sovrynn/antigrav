<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The heat-proof metals are made out of the three, 
Souma, Soundaala, and Morthweeka mentioned in the previous chapter. It 
is said in "Loha Ratnaakara" that each of the three yields varieties of 
seed metals. Their names are, in souma group,--souma, soumyaka, 
sundaasya, soma, panchaanana, ooshmapa, shaktigarbha, jaangalika, 
praanana, shankha, and laaghava; The names of the metals of soundeera 
origin, are viranchi, souryapa, shanku, ushna, soorana, shinjikaa, 
kanku, ranjika, soundeera, mugdha, and ghundaaraka. In the mourthweeka 
group, the 11 are anuka, dvyanuka, kanka, tryanuka, shvetaambara, 
mridambara, baalagarbha, kuvarcha, kantaka, kshvinka and laghvika.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">"By Mixing"</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The said metals are to be mixed in requisite 
proportions and melted. It is said in "Lohatantra" that ushnambhara 
metal is produced by mixing numbers 10, 5, 8 of soma, soundala, 
mourthweeka groups of metals respectively in the proportion of 1, 3, 7, 
and mixing with one third the quantity of tankana or borax and melting 
in the crucible. Similarly taking metals no, 3, 5, and 7 respectively in
 the three groups in the proportion of 4, 1, and 8, and mixing with 
tankana, and melting in crucible, the metal ooshma is obtained. Metal 
ooshmahana is produced by melting metals 2, 5, and 9 from the three 
groups in the proportion of 6, 3, and 7, with tankana. Metal Raaja is 
produced by melting nos. 3, 8, and 2 of the three groups as before. 
Similarly metal Aamlatrit is produced by taking numbers 9, 7, 1 in the 
three metal groups, in the proportion of 10, 7, 8 and mixing with 
tankana and melting as prescribed.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Similarly metals 6, 4, 5, respectively in the 
proportion of 5, 5, 12, melted with tankana or borax, will yield the 
metal veerahaa. The metal panchaghna is got by taking numbers 8, 6, and 4
 of the three groups in the proportion of 20, 18, 26, and mixing with 
tankana or borax and melting.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The metal agnitrit is produced by mixing numbers 
5, 2, 10, in the proportion of 30, 20, and 10, and melting with borax in
 the crucible. The metal bhaarahana is produced by mixing numbers 7, 11,
 and 6 in the three groups in the proportion of 5, 12, and 7, mixing 
with borax, and melting in the crucible.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">To produce metal sheetahana, metals 10, 9, and 3 
in the three groups respectively, in the proportion of 22, 8, and 10, 
should be mixed with borax and melted in the crucible. Garalaghna is 
produced by taking numbers 11, 10, and 11 in the three groups in the 
proportion of 20, 30, and 8, and melting with borax in the crucible.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Similarly Aamlahana is produced by taking numbers 
11, 8, and 4 in the three groups in the proportion of 20, 12, 36, and 
melting with borax in the crucible. Metal Vishambhara is produced by 
taking numbers 19, 8, and 10 in</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Metal vishalyakrit is produced by taking numbers 
3, 5, and 11, in the proportion of 20, 12, and 6, and melting in the 
crucible with borax. Dwijamitra is produced by taking numbers 8, 3, and 9
 in the pro-portion 5, 8, 10, and melting with borax in the crucible. 
And metal Vaatamitra is produced by taking numbers 8, 6, and 5 in the 
three groups of Ooshmapa metals, in the proportion of 22, 8, and 10, and
 adding borax and melting in the crucible.</font></p>  <h3 align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">According to "Nirnayaadhikaara", the melting of 
the superior, medium, and inferior kinds of metals is to be done in 407 
different kinds of crucibles. They are divided into 12 groups. For the 
melting of the root-metals the second group of crucibles is considered 
the best.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Lallacharya also states that metallurgists mention
 12 kinds of metals: kritaka or artificial, apabhramshaka or corrupted, 
sthalaja or mud-born, khanija or found in mines, jalaja or aquatic, 
dhaatuja or mineral-born, oshadhivargaja or vegetation-born, krimija or 
evolved from vermin, maamsaja or flesh-born, kshaaraja or grown from 
salts, baalaja or hairborn, and andaja or resultant from eggs. Different
 classes of crucibles are to be used for melting different kinds of 
metals. In the second class of crucibles there are said to be 40 
varieties. Of them, number 5, known as antarmukha or inward-mouthed, is 
prescribed for melting the root-metals.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is described in "Mooshaakalpa" or art of making
 crucibles. 8 parts of gingelly manure or black-gram flour, 4 parts of 
metal rust, 3 parts of metal, 3 parts of laangalee or jussieuea repens 
or gloriosa superba, 6 parts of gum arabic, 2 parts of ruruka, 3 parts 
of salt-petre, 5 parts of creepers, 6 parts of charcoal, 5 parts of 5 
kinds of grasses, 4 parts of paddy husk ashes, 2 parts of red arsenic, 2
 parts of naagakesara, 5 parts of varolika</font></p>

laamancha or scented grass or andropogon muricatus, 5 parts of sindoora 
or red ochre, 2 parts of gunja seeds or wild liquorice, 4 parts of 
sea-foam, all these are to be ground and made into fine flour, to which 
are added equal quantity of gum and 5 parts of earth and dust, and the 
whole is baked in a vessel with shivaaree oil for 3 yaamaas or 9 hours. 
When the contents have unified and become properly fluid, it should be 
poured through the nozzle into the crucible mould, and allowed to rest. 
The resultant crucible, known as "antarmukha," would be best suited to 
melt the metals required for producing a Vimaana.</font></p>  <h3 align="center">

<p><font face="Arial">Having dealt with crucible in the last sootra, we now consider the fire-place.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Experts mention 532 varieties of vyaasatikaas or 
fire-places. Of them Koorma-vyaasatika, or tortoise-shaped fire-place is
 best suited for melting the seed-metals for the Vimaana.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">Kunda-kalpa or the art of furnace construction 
mentions 532 kinds of furnaces. They are divided into seven classes, 
each including 76 varieties. Furnace no. 9 in the 7th class, is best 
suited for melting the requisite metals of the vimaana, and its name is 
koorma-vyaasatikaa, or tortoise-shaped furnace.</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">It is said in "Kunda-nirnaya ", that on a prepared
 ground, a quadrilateral or circular shaped furnace 10 feet wide should 
be constructed, shaped like a tortoise. In order to place the bellows, 
there should be constructed a pedestal shaped like a tortoise, and with 
five faces. In the middle of the furnace arrangements should be made for
 placing the crucible. On either side of the furnace there should be an 
enclosure for stocking charcoal. And on either side there should be a 
mechanism for receiving the molten metal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bodhaananda Vritti:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The making of bellows is referred to in this 
sootra. It is said in "Bhastrikaa Nibandhana," that as there are 532 
kinds of furnaces, there are 532 kinds of bellows. Narayana also says 
that there are 532 varieties of bellows used in melting metals. They arc
 divided into 8 classes. In the eighth class, the variety numbered 16 is
 the one suited for the tortoise--shaped furnace. The construction of 
bellows is described in the work "Bhastrikaa-Nibandhana", as follows:</font></p>  
<p><font face="Arial">The barks of suitable trees, leather, thick cloth 
made from milk cream, bark of areca-nut palm tree, and trinetra (bael? 
Bengal Quince?), shundeera, suranji, silk-cotton, sheneera, munjaakara, 
and jute by due processing yield suitable cloth of 605 varieties with 
which pretty and attractive bellows could be made, with fittings of wood
 or copper.</font></p>
