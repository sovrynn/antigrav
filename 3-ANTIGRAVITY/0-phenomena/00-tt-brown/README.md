"The Biefeldâ€“Brown effect is an electrical phenomenon, first noticed by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown in the 1920s, where high voltage applied to the electrodes of an asymmetric capacitor causes a net propulsive force toward the smaller electrode."

Fundamentally, the capacitor consists of two oppositely charged objects separated by an insulating (dielectric) material. TT Brown proposed that the system accelerated towards the positive charge, and other sources say it accelerates towards the smaller electrode.

# Is it real? Is it just ion wind?

The literature is conflicting on this which is very annoying.

Conventional literature says it doesn't work in a vacuum, and that it is due to ion wind, which makes me think the opposite is true.

APEC replicated it in a vacuum apparently.

# Original experiments

His experiments very clearly suggest that the electrodes were symmetrical - I don't see any mention of asymmetricness in his paper.

# Apec Replication in a Vacuum

These guys replicated this effect in a vacuum https://www.youtube.com/shorts/O7SccndFwJE

Indicating it is real.

The so-called "Campbell Thruster" PDF from NASA is included here. Apparently, they didn't get it to work in a vacuum, and they believe it is caused by ion wind.

# Learning more: rexresearch

The best place for study of his work has been on rexresearch.

Interestingly, I don't see a single mention of the word "asymmetric" on his page. Additionally, the capacitors all seem to be symmetric.

# Does it create an ether/dielectric fluid flow?

Evidently, yes, because there are many many experiments showing that ion propulsion devices push smoke.

Here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eEJVESn5jU

The next question is whether this is creating a particle fluid dynamics flow and operating on conservation of momentum (conventional mechanics), or rather, whether it is pushing ether and modifying the gravity around it.
