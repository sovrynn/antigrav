Here's the basic idea. It's really not that complicated.

The big effects are just accumulations of the smaller effects - nothing more. Additionally, even at the tiniest level, all the fundamental interactions can be seen and understood.

Don't think in terms of objects - these are illusions created by our brains and minds.

# Starting principles

Even the tiniest amount of mass creates gravity.

Even the tiniest current (electron spin) creates magnetism.

Even the tiniest movement of electric current creates a magnetic field.

# Deduced principles

Even the tiniest amount of "electric charge"/"electrons" also create some form of gravity.

Additionally, even the tiniest amount of "electric charge" movement (magnetism) will also affect gravity.

Once the fundamental interactions are understood, then a resulting craft can easily be built.
