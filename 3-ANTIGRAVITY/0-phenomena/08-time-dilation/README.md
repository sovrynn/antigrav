Time dilation has been observed by one of the researchers... I believe it is Grebennikov?

If, in the classified physics model of black-programs, time is absolute, how then could time dilation also be a resultant phenomenon of forces?

How could time dilation be a "manifestation resulting from motion through the absolute ether"?

What is time in relation to the ether?
