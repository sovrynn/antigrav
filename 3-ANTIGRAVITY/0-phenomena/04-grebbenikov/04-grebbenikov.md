IF Grebbenikov's craft was real (it could very well be a hoax), it is another useful data point for us.

# Beetle wings as supercapacitors?

Recall that supercapacitors (capacitors, as used in TT Brown's experiments) include the following categories of materials:

Supercapacitors:
- Activated carbon: enormous microscopic surface area (thousands of mÂ² per gram)
- Ionic electrolytes: ultra-thin effective separation (nanometers), giving capacitances in the farads range in handheld sizes.
- Graphene and carbon nanotubes: similar principle, very high conductivity + surface area.

We have no idea how Grebbenikov constructed his craft. But from the material I've found, it is surmised that his craft consisted of a large layer of beetle wings, which somehow achieved his effects.

# Unexplained

How did he accelerate sideways at such great speeds?

Did he tilt certain parts of the blocks sideways?

His story is very much unexplained. Despite the clues in his book.
