Grebennikov describes this.

And by logic - if humans have invented these craft that can maneuver at these ridiculous speeds and make sharp turns, then inertia should not apply when they make turns...

How is this possible?

We know if the Earth shifts, then the rotational inertia of the water will push it over the mountains, rather than keep it stable...

So shouldn't the same happen to humans inn an antigrav craft?
