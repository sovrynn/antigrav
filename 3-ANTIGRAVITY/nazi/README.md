Found a great book on this.

Also a great site (I think it's the same as what's in the book): https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/reichblacksun/contents.htm#Contents

# Overview

2 types of inventions:

1. Flight machine with 3 inner disc plates... a cylinder goes through the center. The upper and lower disc plates spun in opposite directions. This was apparently not just a flight craft but an attempt to open a portal to another world...

2. A disc craft: Hans Coler free energy Konverter, Van De Graaf band generator and Marconi vortex dynamo (huge spherical tank of mercury) to create powerful rotating electromagnetic fields. Apparently these disc craft couldn't carry anything and could only make turns of 22.5, 45, and 90 degrees.

Also of note: Hans Coler's free energy Konverter.
