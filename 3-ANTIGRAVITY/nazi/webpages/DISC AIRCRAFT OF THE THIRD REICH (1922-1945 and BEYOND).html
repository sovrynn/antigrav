 primary focus of Thule-Gesellschaft was the discovering the origins of 
the  Aryan race. Thule comes from the Greek and means "land". This 
society was named  after "Ultima Thule"- the "Farthest Land" and capital
 of ancient Hyperborea at  the extreme north near Greenland or Iceland. 
The Thulists also believed in the  hollow earth theory and spent years 
of expeditions to remote parts of the earth  in search of the entrances 
to the inner world where they could contact ancient  civilizations that 
went underground and worship the Black Sun. Thule found its  true 
purpose through the joining of societies in 1919 with the Vril 
Gesellschaft  and DHvSS which also believed in worship of the Black Sun;
 but it was the  psychic mediums of Vril and Thule's own resident 
psychic Maria Orsic that  convinced them that the Aryan race didn't 
originate from earth but from  Aldebaran in Alpha Tauri - 64 light years
 away. Vril also convinced the DHvSS  (Men of the Black Stone) that 
their mountain goddess Isias was the queen of  Aldebaran. <br><br><br><img src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/ger3b.png"><br><br><strong>Nazi Germany <br>national flag</strong> <br></p></font></font><p align="justify"></p></center></td></tr></tbody></table> </center>			</div>

 a weapon on the ground was practically useless, but a giant reflective 
 solar space mirror could actually burn aircraft right out of the sky. 
Noordung’s  disc space station concept could have easily been turned 
into one giant armed  fortress in space. Hitler expressed interest in 
the idea up until the last year  of the war with fantastic unrealistic 
dreams of an armed space station launched  from Peenemünde by von Braun 
up to an orbit of 4,000  miles!<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">But
 rocketry success was  years away and both Thule and Vril took little 
notice or interest in the VFR  Verein für Raumschiffahrt ( a.k.a. German
 Rocket Association). Such occult  societies viewed rocket power as 
wasted energy and time so they pursued their  own disc designs with 
great enthusiasm and will. <br><br>Apart from the Thule  and Vril dream 
of Raumflug (Spaceflight) was another German disc designer who to  this 
day remains virtually unknown. His name was Dr. Franz Philipp who 
proposed  a series of rockets and discs that were to utilize 
Sonnenstrahl Triebwerke  (Solar ray Thrustwork) engines which were in 
essence light conversion power  plants - a very radical concept in the 
year preceding World War II. <br><br>Dr.  Philipp envisaged a range of 
these craft under the title Frali. Frali I was  proposed in September 
1938. It resembled a modern-day blimp but with an array of  circular 
solar panels located on each side of the craft and two tailfins at the  
end of the machine. Another Frali design, the Frali VI was a cylindrical
 craft  with a strange layered conical nosecone and flat solar panels 
all over its body  which ended with a single square tailfin. The Philipp
 designed Greif (Griffin)  was a large disc aircraft powered by four 
aft-mounted solar rockets similar in  shape to the early A-series 
rockets but covered in solar flat panels. Then there  was Philipp’s 
final design, his Sonnenflieger (Sun Flyer) - a huge glass domed  saucer
 with solar panels running along the rim of the disc and a three layered
  underbody which was supported by rather large lunar-lander type 
telescopic legs.  Dr. Philipp never patented his designs but wrote a 
book that translated into “German Spaceflight Since 1934: A Very 
Troublesome Book”. In it, he claimed to  have built a solar rocket and 
fired it towards the moon in the 1930s, but no  such evidence has ever 
been produced to substantiate such a claim. <br><br>Nevertheless, Dr. 
Philipp was a World War I comrade of Adolf Hitler and  was responsible 
during the Second World War for a wide range of secret project  research
 including the often spoken of “Death Ray” which actually was a crude  
form of microwave weapon developed at a research facility in Berlin. 
When the  war ended Dr. Philipp was captured by the Russians and 
employed as a “camp  screener” for German scientists due to his ability 
to speak several languages - among them fluent Russian. Philipp later 
claims that he kept important German  scientists away from various 
Soviet weapons programs postwar but admits he  shared his knowledge on 
death ray technology. <br><br>Adolf Hitler (a Thule  member along with 
Göring, Himmler, Bormann, Hess, and various other top Nazi  officials), 
on the other hand, became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and thus the  
eleven year occult metaphysical science of Thule-Vril became 
strengthened with  official state backing for the continued disc 
development programs starting with  an RFZ Rundflugzeug (Round Aircraft)
 series of discs that utilized levitator  technology developed by 
Professor Winfried Otto Schumann of the Technical  University of Munich 
who worked on the mysterious JFM from 1922-24. <br><br>The  year 1937 
saw the first RFZ discs built, RFZ units 1-3 after Vril had purchased  
the fallow land surrounding the Arado Brandenburg aircraft plant for 
flight  testing. The first RFZ series utilized the early Schumann 
levitators, but often  with disastrous results. The very first disc, 
RFZ-1, rose very briefly only to  60 meters before losing flight 
control. Pilot Lothar Waiz, testing the machine  at Arado Brandenburg, 
quickly bailed from the wobbling double-hulled disc with  Ar-196 
controls and attached tail unit failing to function, causing the machine
  to spin out of control and crash into the ground. Not to be 
discouraged, the  RFZ-2 was built the same year and achieved a measure 
of success. This was a very  small armed disc with two light MGs that 
was used in 1940 for reconnaissance  over the British Isles and in the 
South Atlantic with a rendezvous with the  German commerce raider 
Atlantis during the same year. The RFZ 3, 4, and 6 were  all prototypes 
that grew larger and more powerful in each subsequent test model.  They 
were built from 1937-1942. The brief designation of RFZ-5 was renamed  
Haunebu in 1939 with the RFZ-7 becoming the Vril-1 Jäger (Hunter) in 
1941. <br><br>These highly advanced disc aircraft were overseen by 
Himmler's SS - specifically, the occult “Order of the Black Sun” SS 
Technical Branch Unit E-IV  (Entwicklungsstelle 4) which was created to 
explore various alternative  energies. This unit was tasked with 
developing both the Haunebu and Vril disc  designs that utilized the 
world's first electro-magnetic-gravitic drive systems:  the Vril and 
Thule Triebworks (Thrustworks). These drives relied on Hans Coler's  
SS-adapted free energy Konverter (Magnetstromapparat) coupled to various
 Van De  Graaf band generators and a Marconi vortex dynamo (a huge 
spherical tank of  heated mercury at the center of each craft) to create
 powerful rotating  electromagnetic fields that affected gravity and 
reduced mass. <br><br></font></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><div align="center"> <strong> </strong><table class="MsoTableGrid" style="border: white; border-collapse: collapse; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-yfti-tbllook: 191; mso-padding-alt: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-border-insideh: .5pt solid windowtext; mso-border-insidev: .5pt solid windowtext;" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody> <tr style="mso-yfti-irow: 0; mso-yfti-lastrow: yes;"> <td valign="top" style="padding: 0in 5.4pt; border: 1pt solid windowtext; background-color: transparent; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt;"><o:p> <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><br></p> <p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><img src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/van2.jpg"></p> <p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><br><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hans Coler Magnetstromapparat gravitic battery <br></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">modified by SS into Coler Konverter</font></strong></p></o:p></td><td valign="top" style="border-width: 1pt 1pt 1pt medium; border-style: solid solid solid none; border-color: windowtext windowtext windowtext rgb(236, 233, 216); padding: 0in 5.4pt; background-color: transparent; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; mso-border-left-alt: solid windowtext .5pt;"><o:p><strong> </strong><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><br></p><strong> </strong><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><img src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/van1.jpg"></p> <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Photo of 1930s Van De Graaf generators, <br></strong></font><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">the type that would be inside the <br>Haunebu craft, albeit modified by the SS&nbsp;</font><br></strong>&nbsp;</p></o:p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Many
 have often inquired "why" then when  war started in 1939 did Germany 
not use these advanced and unique machines in  air combat? The simple 
truth lies in the fact that these machines, despite their  superior 
overall performance to conventional piston-engine aircraft and early  
jets, could not be realistically adapted to any useful military role 
other than  the most basic transport and reconnaissance work. The strong
 electromagnetic  engines were difficult to control and required a 
complex celestial navigation  system to fly. While maximum speed and 
range were beyond belief, the flight  characteristics of the discs could
 not hope to imitate high-performance fighters  like the Me Bf 109 or 
Fw-190 in aerial combat.<font face="Verdana" size="3"></font></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"><strong><img width="500" height="235" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da5.png"></strong></p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Early Messerschmitt Bf 109  fighter</strong></font></p></font></font></div></font></font></font></center><div align="center"><font size="5"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"></p><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3">There
 was very little room for either offensive or defensive armament in 
these  designs except for a few experimental light MG and MK cannons 
that proved  impractical in flight and a large experimental Donar KSK 
Kraftstrahlkanone  ("Thunder" Power Ray Cannon). These guns tended to 
destabilize the discs badly  and were eventually removed or replaced 
with lighter automated guns, usually  mounted above the control center 
of each disc. The disc bodies themselves were  not capable of carrying 
any ordnance at all internally or externally (no bombs,  rockets, or 
missiles) and could initially only make turns of 22.5, 45, and 90  
degrees due to a complex control system that utilized mag-field 
impulsers  (magnetic field shifting) to rapidly change direction. 
Extreme heat shielding  was also required due to the fantastic speeds at
 which these machines could  achieve. SS metallurgists came up with an 
advanced material known as Viktalen  but the larger the design meant 
single, double, and even triple hulls to protect  the crews. Viktalen 
was unusual in that it was more of an armor plating than of  aircraft 
construction material. Due to the weight factor, especially in the  
Haunebu series these craft became enormous. <br><br>Nevertheless, the SS
 pursued  an aggressive policy of theft, forced cooperation, and strong 
internal  development of these types of machines due to the increasing 
Allied bombing  offensive that made conventional aircraft take-offs and 
landings highly  dangerous as the war progressed towards imminent 
defeat. VTOL (Vertical Take-Off  and Landing) was seen as the most 
logical solution to this problem. If the SS  could develop a production 
machine that in the future could be armed (with  cannon, missiles, 
electrostatic, or even plasma weapons) then Germany might be  able to 
turn the air war. <br><br>To shorten the time of finding VTOL solutions,
  the SS robbed both Germany's patent office and every patent office in 
occupied  Europe. Those with aeronautical skill enough to contribute to 
the SS effort were  either arrested or coerced into participating in the
 programs - among them  Viktor Schauberger of Austria and Henri Coanda 
of Rumania. The SS also used its  large slave labor force to assist in 
construction of large underground  facilities for these discs and often 
for production of components to these  machines. <br><br>Though the SS 
requested additional slave laborers from  Armaments Minister Albert 
Speer near the end of the war, Speer himself was not  told “what” war 
projects the laborers would be used for; indeed, Speer was  deliberately
 kept out of the entire SS disc development programs for security  
reasons and the fact that the SS was a state-within-a-state with its own
  production facilities, war material, scientists and technicians, slave
  workforce, and the knowledge of secret Third Reich military bases 
outside  Germany where the discs were both tested and stored. Speer was 
considered  untrustworthy and a security risk like Rudolf Hess had been.
 It has been alleged  postwar that Hess held secret knowledge of the 
German disc programs and both the  Antarctic and Argentine bases; thus, 
for that reason alone was held isolated  from the world ever since his 
capture. We will never know as his secrets died  with him in 1987 
(either as a result of suicide or murder).</font></font></p></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Among
 those being held, Viktor Schauberger  became the leader of most

 1941, a year after the Repulsin Model A motor was being studied one of 
 Heinkel's own flight engineers named Rudolf Schriever proposed his own 
 "Flugkreisel" (Flight Gyro) that utilized conventional jet engines 
instead of  the Repulsin discoid motor. His design was taken from him by
 the SS and handed  over to a team of scientists for further study and 
construction of a large  flying prototype. The primary team consisted of
 Dr. Richard Miethe, Klaus  Habermohl, and Dr.Giuseppe Belluzzo plus six
 more engineers that remained  unnamed even after the war. <br><br><font face="verdana" size="3">Dr.Giuseppe
 Belluzo, the only Italian among them, had come up with his own design 
for a jet powered round flying bomb - the  Turboproietti (Turbine 
Projectile) that would later remove him from the  Flugkreisel program 
entirely and return him to the Fiat Riva Del Garda facility  in Italy. </font></font></p><font face="verdana" size="3"><p align="justify"><font face="verdana" size="3">Meanwhile,
 BMW (who were to provide the turbojets for the  Flugkreisel) started 
internal work on a design very similar to Schriever's  Flugkreisel but 
utilizing the company's own BMW 003 jet engines. These machines,  called
 "Flügelrads" (Winged Wheels) were not true disc aircraft but jet  
auto-gyros that used a standard BMW 003 turbojet with a Strahlrohr (Jet 
pipe)  deflector to power a multi-blade disc rotor. These craft were 
built on a much  smaller scale than Schriever's Flugkreisel, so work 
proceeded from 1941-45 with  construction of prototypes beginning in 
1943. Instability, however, was never  really solved in the earlier 
designs. Most remained either tethered during  testing or only made 
short hops. Only one disc, a BMW Flügelrad II V-2 (or V-3)  possibly 
achieved level flight in April 1945. <br><br>Schriever's own design  
began to take shape in 1942 and flew in 1943. It flew under jet power 
provided  by three attached special kerosene-burning engines driving the
 disc rotor as  well as two kerosene jets attached to the body for 
forward thrust and horizontal  stability. Its jets made a horrendous 
whine as the large disc took time to  power-up before take-off. Flight 
characteristics were said to be fair with the  exception of inherent 
instability at low speed. But then the SS decided to  abruptly drop 
Schriever's jet-fan design in favor of one of Dr. Miethe's designs  that
 eliminated the large disc rotor blades driven by jet engines altogether
 for  Schauberger's vortex engine, but on a larger scale. <br><br>With 
Schauberger  released back to Leonstein, Austria in 1944 by the SS the 
Miethe prototype  constructed in Breslau took to the air the same year 
over the Baltic. It's  resemblance to the Repulsin Model B was 
unmistakable except for the addition of  a bubble cockpit on top and 
water drainage (bleed) pipes to the rear of the  craft instead of at the
 bottom. Another design by Miethe may have been built  during the war - 
the Elektrische Luft Turbine (Electric Air Turbine) patented in  Germany
 postwar by Bruno Schwenteit, crediting both Miethe and Schriever. This 
 was a unique unmanned disc that burned oxygen and nitrogen in a 
superheated  chamber injected with helium to produce tremendous thrust. 
It is perhaps this  design alone that could be the mysterious, 
often-quoted V-7 weapon. <br><br>At  the same time, a private venture 
with official backing from Air Ministry General  Udet was taking shape 
in Leipzig. Arthur Sack, a farmer, who caught the  attention of Udet way
 back in 1939 with his A.S.1 circular wing flying aero  model was given 
permission and some funding to build a manned large-scale  version of 
his model. Sack took up the challenge and built four more models of  
increasing size. When the A.S.5 demonstrated that the basic concept was 
sound,  construction began on the manned version in early 1944 - the 
A.S.6.</font></p><font face="verdana" size="3"></font></font><font face="verdana" size="3"></font><font face="verdana" size="3"><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
 Within a month the strange largely wooden aircraft utilizing  salvaged 
parts from a Me Bf 109 was taxiing and making attempts to fly. But this 
 project was doomed from the start with an underpowered engine and 
plagued by  structural problems which meant that the aircraft could 
"hop"- but never fly -  even when a Me-163 Komet pilot based at Brandis 
AB gave it a try. Like the chief  test pilot, the Komet pilot suggested 
that the A.S.6 held potential if  aerodynamically tested properly in a 
wind tunnel and handed over to  Messerschmitt for improvement utilizing 
superior Me Bf 109 components and  cannon. <br></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"><img width="500" height="255" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da7.png"> <br><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Messerschmitt Me-163 Komet, 1944</strong></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Had
 Sack listened instead of forging ahead on his own, the next design  
designated A.S.7V-1 might have become a formidable 500 mph fighter known
 under  production as the Me-600 “Bussard“. <br><br>Due to 
round-the-clock bombing by  1944 the SS was forced to try even more 
drastic measures, launching unmanned  interceptor discs from German 
occupied territory. These discs were known as the  "Feuerball" weapon, 
sometimes erroneously referred to as the mystery V-7 weapon  or an 
aerial Flakmine. <br><br>The WNF Feuerball relied on a flattened 
circular  turbojet for launch, a plume sensor for aerial detection, and 
an electrostatic  field weapon invented at Messerschmitt's Oberammergau 
facility for attack.  Production of these craft was initially performed 
by WNF under SS direction.  Because the discs burned chemicals around 
its ring to create the electrostatic  field necessary to disable Allied 
bomber engines and airborne radar the object  was soon nicknamed the 
"Foo Fighter" by the Allies who sighted this fiery halo  weapon 
approaching them by day or night. "Foo" was a take on the French word 
Feu  (Fire) and from the Smokey Stover comic of a bumbling fireman that 
actually  started fires! His famous saying was, “where there’s Feu, 
there’s fire”, so the  US nickname stuck. The British simply called them
 “Kraut Meteors”!  <br><br>Naturally, WNF observed the burning effect 
too and officially named  their weapon the WNF Feuerball (Fireball). The
 "Feuerballs" plagued the 415th  NFS and other Allied aircraft from 
November 1944 until April 1945. By that time  production had been 
shifted to the Zeppelin Werke that named their enlarged  improved weapon
 as the "Kugelblitz" (Ball Lightning). These were launched form  the 
Schwarzwald (Black Forest). <br><br>The Allies seemed confused by these 
 weapons which ranged in size from small to large and attacked in 
singles or  multiples. The Germans added to this confusion by 
introducing two OTHER weapons  with the Feuerball/Kugelblitz - the 
"Seifenblasen" and "Kugelwaffen".  "Seifenblasen" (Soap Bubbles) were 
large meteorological balloons trailing foil  strips that confused Allied
 radar. Their large round shape and metallic coating  reflected in 
daylight gave them the appearance of a shining globe mistaken for a  
Feuerball. Along with the Seifenblasen were launched purely spherical 
aerial  probes that were used as psychological weapons. These 
"Kugelwaffen" (Ball  Weapons) initiated in 1941 played aerial games with
 the Allied bomber gunners  that would have in time distracted them from
 the real threat of larger  approaching Kugelblitz discs. 
Chronologically, the smaller Kugelwaffen seem to  be the predecessors to
 the Feuerball as several are seen in 1942-43 photos taken  over Japan 
as a technology transfer. The same type weapons are also seen over  
Italian and German skies in 1944. <br><br>Hermann Klaas worked on 
several of  these remote-controlled objects and even the early Feuerball
 prototypes were  nothing more than small silver jet discs launched off 
catapults and then  remote-controlled to test Allied bomber crew 
responses to them.<br></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"><img width="211" height="137" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/Coanda_Disc.jpg">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Unconfirmed Coanda  disc</strong></font> </p><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">But
 by the spring of 1945  the war was lost regardless and most of the 
remaining programs were halted.  Henri Coanda had been arrested in Paris
 in 1940 and forced to work on a disc  under SS supervision. His design 
for a lenticular disc that benefited from his  own "Coanda Effect" was a
 masterpiece of jet disc design. But because it  required twelve Jumo 
004 jets to power the huge machine the project never got  past the wind 
tunnel testing phase. Likewise, Andreas Epp’s independent Omega  Diskus 
which utilized two Pabst ramjets and eight Argus lift fans was also  
confined to 1/10th scale model testing. Epp would postwar help design 
the first  Soviet jet disc aircraft in Pirna, East Germany in 1950. <br><br>Dr.
 Alexander  Lippisch, who had also studied disc aerodynes as far back as
 1941, was too  involved in the Me 163 Komet and DM-1 delta glider 
programs to produce anything  more than brief disc design concepts for 
Messerschmitt based on the AVA  Göttingen wind tunnel K 1253 circular 
wing profile. <br><br>The Horten brothers,  experts with flying wings, 
also studied circular wing designs but did not  actually work on any in 
Nazi Germany. They did so for the US Govt. postwar in  1946 at Wright 
Field designing what is now believed to be the craft that crashed  at 
Roswell in 1947- a radar-absorbing spy craft parabolic lifting body 
carried  by a large meteorological balloon similar to the Japanese FUGO 
type. <br><br>In  the face of imminent defeat BMW destroyed all their 
Flügelrads and possibly  Schriever's Flugkreisel which was testing at 
the same facility - Prag-Kbley  airfield. Dr. Miethe's discs may have 
been captured as Dr. Miethe went to Canada  postwar to work on AVRO's 
disc designs. Habermohl was captured by the Russians  and worked on disc
 designs for them while Dr. Belluzzo went back to Italy.  Schauberger's 
Repulsins were captured by the Russians while most of the SS  Technical 
Branch records still intact were captured by the British who postwar  
attempted to create a working design through AVRO Canada with eventual 
US  assistance. Clever US Govt. infiltration tactics and funding 
withdrawal ensured  that AVRO Canada’s German-based disc designs were 
abandoned there while AVRO  Canada’s engineers were lured to the US to 
work on the first US jet discs,  ironically built by a team led by Dr. 
Miethe himself! <br><br>One very little  known Peenemünde disc project 
under Henrich Fleissner was the last disc to take  off from Berlin in 
late April 1945 on an official mission. But details of  Göring‘s 
"Düsenscheibe" (Jet Disc) remain clouded in mystery. This is the only  
known Luftwaffe disc program which originated with Hermann Göring and 
assembled  at Peenemünde. Just as baffling is the late war DFS Berserker
 Mistel combination  that combined a project jet bomber with a liquid 
explosive laden disc guided by  television control and powered by a mass
 of staggered Argus 044 pulse jets. Only  the television guidance system
 test aircraft was nearing completion when the war  ended. <br><br><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">Other
 strange disc programs included  experimental Lichtscheiben (Light 
Discs), unmanned light-guided small explosive  discs directed by 
searchlight batteries against the RAF, nicknamed  "Glühscheiben" (Glow 
Discs) by Flak Helferinen (female searchlight battery  auxilliaries); 
the Zell Luftkreisel (Air Gyro) missiles, and even German Army  
Scheibenhandgranaten (Disc hand grenades) made out of Nipolit fashioned 
 explosives. Most were small discs painted green with an inserted 
detonator. but  at least one attack was made by a Frisbee-sized Nipolit

 Mario Zippermayr’s unusual fascination with coal dust explosives led to
 a radical  disc aircraft called the “Feuersturm” (Firestorm) that was 
designed to created a  spinning fire tornado into the path of Allied 
bombers but the proposal came  during the collapse. Göring placed an 
order for coal dust Flak shells in March  1945 but none were delivered. 
It is interesting to note that the SS took  Zippermayr’s coal dust Flak 
shells and added a reagent to the mix which could  have been a Nazi 
Superbomb equal in devastation to the Atomic Bomb. The reagent,  mixed 
with LOX and coal dust would create both an initial firestorm and then a
  freak lightning storm at ground level. This would consume all the air 
and burn  everything, people and all matter in a 4.5 km radius. Plans to
 build such a bomb  at the Jonastal S-3 complex and new Hitler HQ failed
 as the complex was not  completed in time. <br></font></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"> <img width="450" height="194" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da14.png"> <br></p><p align="center"><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jonastal S-III factory  uncompleted in 1945</font> <br></strong></p><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meanwhile,
 the Feuerball attacks that stopped in April 1945 in Germany resumed  in
 August 1945 in Japan - another obvious technology transfer from Germany
 to  Japan via U-Boot. The Japanese, however, lacked all the 
documentation for this  weapon and only launched a few after fueling 
them and igniting them. It is said  that the Japanese were frightened by
 this "demonic thing" and destroyed the  remaining Feuerballs by 
dynamiting them together in a large pit after VJ-Day.  Photographic 
evidence also seems to identify "Kugelwaffen" sent to Japan as  several 
are seen trailing Sally bombers, probably for flight testing.  <br><br>But
 the Third Reich story ends as strangely as it had begun. What about  
the mysterious Thule-Vril discs which were actually built in small 
numbers  during the war? By 1945 there were quite a few Haunebu and Vril
 7 Geist (Spirit)  discs flying. Vril had even tested the Vril 8 Odin 
and possibly even the more  streamlined Vril 9 Abjäger, which appeared 
over occupied German skies. Designs  for even more exotic Vril 10 
Fledermaus (Bat) and Vril 11 Teufel (Devil) discs  were to be destroyed 
but several technical documents of them were discovered.  Larger still 
was the 139 meter long Andromeda Gerät - a huge mothership designed  to 
carry one large Haunebu and two Vril discs in two bays built into the 
side of  the craft. One of possibly two was discovered in 1945 by US 
Army troops in a  well-camouflaged above ground shelter. It was 
semi-completed but due to forced  evacuation both the sensitive 
navigation gear and propulsion systems were  removed from the giant. The
 other cylindrical craft is assumed to have already  departed, but to 
where? The Andromeda Gerät was designed as a Raumschiff  (Spaceship) 
with propulsion combining four of Thule’s revolutionary Triebwerks  with
 sixteen of Vril‘s SM-Levitators. One craft spotted over Germany at the 
end  flew at incredible speed with a blinding light emitting from its 
tail worrying  Allied Intelligence teams that the Germans might have 
developed a form of  photonic drive. The rest of the Haunebu and Vril 
craft were not destroyed but  quickly evacuated from March 1945 to an 
area safe from Allied bombing or  capture. <br><br></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"> <img width="300" height="282" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da10.png"> <br><br><font size="2"><strong>1938-1939 German Antarctic  Expedition <br></strong><br><br> <img src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/ant88.jpg"> <br></font></p><font size="2"><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>The Schwabenland launching  a Dornier Super Wal during the Antarctic expedition<br></strong></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">In

1942-43, a base  was built in the Mühlig-Hoffman Mountains, just inland

 supplied with slave laborers  shipped by sea and U-boats to construct

Bormann and Göbbels in  the Führer bunker were sent to Tierra del Fuego,
 which is a mystery in itself.  <br><br>The SS RuSHA (Rasse und 
SiedlungsHauptAmt- Race and Settlement Bereau)  began in 1942 to take 
women of Aryan decent (Volksdeutsch) from the Ukraine  solely for the 
purpose of transporting them to Base 211. </font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"><strong><img width="300" height="199" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da11.png"></strong></p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2" ?=""><strong>Odal Rune flag of the Volksdeutsche<br></strong></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2" ?=""><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Ten
 thousand women  between the ages of 17-24, blonde and well 
proportioned, were recruited for the  project along with 2,500 Waffen SS
 soldiers serving in Russia. The women were  known as the ASF 
(Antarktische Siedlungen Frauen, Antarctic Settlement Women)  and wore a
 specific light blue form-fitting jacket with SS Odal Rune insignia  and
 an A-line skirt with the hem below the knee. About half of the female  
recruits were ethnic Germans while the others were Ukrainians upgraded 
to full  Aryan status through the “Germanization” process. An ASF 
training camp was  secretly set up in Estonia for proper training in 
polar survival and as a boot  camp meant to teach what was expected to 
ensure that the German colony could  sustain life and grow. Any recruits
 that failed the camp were immediately  shipped to Auschwitz for 
extermination. The acceptable recruits were returned to  the Ukraine 
then taken from the Poltava railway station to transport ships and  
U-boats awaiting them. The goal of this massive undertaking was to 
create a  colony at Base 211 suitable for the habitation and continued 
development of the  Thule-Vril technology. That is why the Kriegsmarine 
kept such a large number of  U-boats in the South Atlantic during the 
latter part of the war, especially the  Type IXc large transport U-boats
 nicknamed “Überseekuh“ (Overseas Cow) </font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"><img width="500" height="223" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da12.png"></p><p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Type <strong>IXC U-Boot, workhorse  of the Kriegsmarine<br></strong></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It
 is believed that both the Thule and Vril Gesellschafts evacuated that  
technology to Base 211 at the close of the war under SS General Kammler,
 who was  in charge of Germany's most secret weapons development 
programs. The occult  discs were to have been produced in the massive 
Jonastal S-3 complex under  construction, but the time had simply run 
out, and the complex remained  unfinished by wars end. However, during 
construction from late 1944 until March  1945 the complex was never 
bombed - even once, despite the huge strategic  facility with thousands 
of scientists and technicians located there and 18,000  slave laborers 
performing construction. The reason the Allies failed to bomb  this 
location was that a large bunker installation below one of the complex  
sections contained an EM (Electro-Magnetic) discharge weapon able to 
produce a  force field seven miles around the complex up to a height of 
30,000 ft. Allied  aircraft that attempted to photograph or bomb the 
site experienced extreme  difficulty with their engines cutting out. A 
similar effect happened on the  ground with military vehicles and 
engines, so they were kept off during  operations. <br><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">Two
 U-boats that  surrendered after the war in Argentina (U-530 and U-977) 
are also believed to  have carried cargo and high-ranking SS to Base 
211. Both boats were largely  empty upon surrender with the crews 
refusing to accurately disclose their cargos  and destinations. 
Argentine waters had been a safe haven for the U-boats during  the war, 
but the US Govt. put tremendous pressure on Argentina to hand over the  
missing U-boats for information on Kammler’s whereabouts and Base 211.  <br><br>It
 became apparent in 1946 that 54 U-boats and over 6,000 technicians  and
 scientists were "missing" from Germany - especially from the SS 
Technical  Branch. There were also 40,000 slave laborers and between 
142,000-250,000 German  citizens unaccounted for. Despite simply writing
 these off as probable losses  and deaths of the war, Washington 
suspected that a large number of these missing  actually escaped to 
South America and Base 211 (if such a base existed). The  United States 
then went on the hunt using the "war criminal" propaganda to cover  up 
the search for technology akin to a South American version of "Operation
  Paperclip". The United States was so concerned about the secret base 
that in  1947 with the first Antarctic summer "Operation Highjump" was 
launched with a  full military task force headed by Admiral Byrd. The 
task force was to head  straight for Antarctica and recon the area for a
 base. If one was found 4,700  armed troops would have been sent to 
capture or destroy it. The task force  performed the aerial recon, 
trailing magnetometers to detect any magnetic  anomalies under the 
ice... but several of Byrd's planes were lost. The aircraft  had run 
into enemy opposition. <br><br>"Operation Highjump" ended in failure as 
 Byrd headed back after several weeks, far short of the eight months 
that was  intended. In his unofficial comments to the South American 
press Byrd stated  that he was attacked by "enemy aircraft that could 
fly from pole to pole at  incredible speed". <br><br>Subsequently, the 
modern UFO phenomenon sprang up in  1947 and concentrated disc 
development programs were initiated in the 1950s that  have continued on
 to present-day "black project" (a.ka SAP, Special Access  Program) 
aircraft operated by the CIA, NSA, and NRO. Even the Federal Republic  
of Germany might also have retained Thule and Vril technology as photos 
have  emerged since the late 1970’s of designated Bundeswehr discs FU-1 
and FU-2.&nbsp; <br><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">For decades after 
Nazi Germany surrendered under Hitler-appointed Reichsführer Karl 
Dönitz, many strange sightings of Vril and Haunebu-type craft and even 
unknown types of U-boats have appeared in South American skies and 
waters. Some of the U-boats bear a strong resemblance to the last U-boat
 type under construction in Germany - the Type XXVI. Plans were sent by 
sea to Neu Schwabenland for their construction.<br></font></font></font></p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><p align="center"> <img width="500" height="279" src="DISC%20AIRCRAFT%20OF%20THE%20THIRD%20REICH%20(1922-1945%20and%20BEYOND)_files/da13.png"> <br></p><p align="center"><font face=" Verdana" size="2" ?=""><strong>Type XXVI U-boat design shipped to Neu  Schwabenland in 1945 <br>This illustration provided by a modeling fan<br></strong></font></p><font face=" Verdana" size="2" ?=""><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font size="3">There

unrecorded. The large  3,600 ton U-boat was larger than any other U-boat

 was code-named “Schwarz Ritter” (Black Knight) and was kept  during the
 war at neutral ports in Spain before heading back to Germany for a  
special mission in late 1944. It was not heard of again until it was 
discovered  in 1993 off Cape Cod, apparently sunk before its mission was
 accomplished. It is  now known as CA-35 after the German naval chart 
location system. It is believed  that the U-boat carried agents 
representing the Reich and large amounts of  Reichsgeld to be used for 
the future funding of a Fourth Reich. This boat was  also designed to 
carry double a standard U-boat crew with provision for carrying  
material and special commandos. For this secret mission Brandenburg 
Commandos  were reputed to be onboard, working secretly for the Abwehr 
and IG Farben‘s  secret NW-7 industrial spies. <br><br>It should have 
been possible to continue  construction of these type of vessels using 
materials brought to Antarctica by  contacts in South America with 
German funding, possibly from the looted  Reichsbank in 1945.<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">With

 is therefore highly ironic that  Antarctica has a treaty banning

 of the Neu Schwabians have already left and helped colonize parts  of 
South America - all part of the Canaris-Vril “Z-Plan” (Zukunft, or 
Future  Plan) to start again having never surrendered in 1945. Perhaps 
nuclear weapons  are with them also.<br><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">The
