			The rejection of relativity meant to a certain extent

            some currency, via its quantum mechanics version of zero point energy 
            or vacuum flux. German scientists were therefore not free to pursue 
            relativistic science, but were free to investigate the enigmatic properties 
            of this new "quantum aether." Indeed, with various esoteric 
            and occult doctrines percolating in the background, such as the notion

		</b><a name="a"></a></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dr. Ing. Ott <b>Christoph Hilgenberg</b> was a student of the 
        renowned Nobel laureate <b>Walter Gerlach</b>, whose work in magnetic spin polarization 
        in 1921 had earned him the Nobel Prize. Hilgenberg, however, while within 
        the "mainstream" of physics, was not one to allow his mind to 
        be constrained by conventional concepts, as any glance at his two little 
        known, but quite unconventional and thought-provoking papers will attest. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1931 Hilgenberg published what may best be called 
        an arcane paper entitled "<i>Gravitation, Tromben, und Wellen in bewegten 
        Medien</i>," or "<i>Gravitation, Beats, and Waves in Moving Media</i>." 
        The title itself is quite suggestive, for it is the first indication that, 
        even before the Nazis, and after relativity, at least one serious and 
        respected German physicist is still thinking of the old idea of an <u>aether</u>, 
        but thinking about it in a way quite different from the <i>static aether concepts of the 19th century</i> that led to the 
        famous Michelson-Morley experiment, and Sagnac's rotational version of 
        it. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For Hilgenberg is thinking of a <b>dynamic aether</b>, spurred in part no 
        doubt by the implications of Sagnac's version of the famous experiment. 
        Hilgenberg's paper was arcane and abstruse in the extreme, advocating 
        the idea of gravitation as a vertical ether sink. Thus, as in relativity, 
        gravity was the consequence of a complex geometry, only in Hilgenberg's 
        case, this meant that "mass" was a geometric result manifest, 
        for example, in a rotating body's interior. This led Hilgenberg to propose 
        the very unconventional idea that the earth - or any other such rotating 
        massive body -expanded and contracted, in a huge wave-like pattern over 
        time. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> In 1938 <u>Hilgenberg</u> followed this paper up with a mathematical 
        and theoretical physics tour de force entitled "<i>Quantenzahlen, Wirbelring-Atommodelle 
        und Heliumsechserring-Aufbauprinzip des Periodensystems der chemischen 
        Elemente</i>," a mind-twister that is no less impressive in English: 
        "<i>A Quantum Number, Vortex Atom Model and Hexagonal-ring Construction 
        Principle of the Periodic System of the Chemical Elements</i>." </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> <b>Hilgenberg</b> 
        had developed the mathematics for a system of modelling complete atoms 
        according to vorticular rotational principles of the now long-discarded 
        aether! </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The combined effect of these two papers and their mathematical 
        and theoretical development allowed Hilgenberg to predict a number of 
        effects completely at variance with relativistic physics, and long before 
        similar observations in the late 20th century began to signal significant 
        problems with the relativistic-Big Bang cosmology, e.g., heterodyning 
        effects on light coming from a body moving toward the observer, or, to 
        put it simply, why red-shift effects sometimes accompany bodies moving 
        toward an observer rather than away from one. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Under Hilgenberg's influence, <b>Carl Friedrich Krafft</b> 
        took this "vorticular quantum mechanics" one step further, and 
        posited atoms as essentially a geometric or topological construct of the 
        aether that acted as "ether pumps", taking in or giving off 
        energy based on the rotations of the various rings of dynamic aether around 
        them. He developed this notion even further by positing various combinations 
        of vorticular, rotating geometries as the basis for the then known sub-atomic particles. Krafft, whose 
        views were totally eclipsed by war's end with the victory of the Allies 
        - which likewise might be seen as a victory of relativity - was left to 
        self- publish his works in this strange world of "non-linear physics", 
        which were duly and promptly ignored by the more conventionally minded 
        linear physics of relativity and its proponents.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>3</b></font></sup> But is there 
        any indication that all this theory about the vorticular and rotational 
        aspect of a dynamic aether was ever pursued beyond the stage of theory? </font></p>
      <p><b> <font size="1" face="Arial">3 No amount of explaining, however, can 
        seem to quell the anti-relativist side of things for the simple feet that 
        in most respects the theory of General Relativity has enormous predictive 
        power, and therefore, scientific value and credibility. It is only recently 
        that some crucial observations have arisen to challenge its assumptions.</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Indeed there is, but it requires a detour by way of 
        a bit of aerodynamics, courtesy of Renato Vesco once again. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><font face="Arial"> <b>B. Disks, Boundary Layer, And Turbines</b><a name="b"></a> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> <b>Vesco</b> maintained an unusual approach throughout the 
        various reprinting of his book, namely, that German experimentation with 
        disk shaped aircraft actually began as an experiment to transform the 
        entire lift surface into the intake vent for a jet turbine. That is to 
        say, on his view, the earliest German "saucers" were nothing 
        more than standard suction aircraft, though admittedly of very unusual 
        design. These experimental aircraft were further the offshoots of German 
        experiments to suction the boundary layer from the lift surfaces of aircraft. 
        </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The "boundary layer" is that small layer - only a few molecules 
        of air thick - of air that "sticks" to a lift surface, such 
        as a wing, and, as an aircraft moves faster, this layer increases the 
        drag on the lift surface, and therefore weakens its efficiency and requires 
        more energy to move the craft. As speed increases and depending on the 
        configuration of the wing itself, great turbulence can build up behind 
        the wing as the result of the thickening of the boundary layer, increasing 
        the aerodynamic resistance. "It seems clear, therefore, even to a 
        layman in aeronautics that the objective should be to move the point of 
        transition as far to the rear of the moving body as possible in order to minimize the expenditure 
        of motive energy required to propel the body through the air. This is 
        especially true in high speed flight, since the power required increases 
        at about the cube of the speed."<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>4</b></font></sup> </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Thus, prior to the war British, American, and particularly German researchers 
        concentrated their efforts to develop various methods to deal with this 
        problem. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Various methods were tried and pursued during the war, 
        including the use of micro-porous sensitized metal called "<i>Luftschwamm</i> 
        " (literally, "air sponge) as both a lift surface and an intake 
        vent for a jet turbine. The goal was simply to suction the boundary layer 
        itself from the lift surface, thereby dramatically decreasing drag, and 
        increasing efficiency and performance at high speed.  
        </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> According to <u>Vesco</u>, 
        the Germans gradually reached some intriguing conclusions in these experiments: 
        </font></p>
      <blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first was that it was not advantageous to transform 
        ordinary aircraft into planes with a controlled boundary layer because 
        the suction principle was deprived of its best attributes and the difficulties 
        of construction did not compensate for the limited advantages.... </font>
		</p>
		</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> In addition, it was demonstrated that inasmuch as they 
        were planning a special turbine-powered project, it would have been advantageous 
        to combine the two mechanisms into a single whole by feeding the turbine 
        with air taken from the wing orifices instead of by the means of the usual 
        forward-ram air intakes. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">....It seems, in fact, that by reworking the old experiments 
        on "potential frictionless current," the German technical experts 
        may in the final days have succeeded experimentally in reducing aerodynamic 
        friction on appropriately shaped bodies to very low values.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>5</b></font></sup></font></p>
		</blockquote>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><font size="1" face="Arial">4 Vesco and Childress,

		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><font size="1" face="Arial">5 Ibid., 
        p. 193, emphasis in the original. </font></b></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> This idea had also occurred to the British as well, 
        but apparently the Germans had had no little success in combining micro-porous 
        "sinterized" air permeable lift surfaces and turbine intakes, 
        for a British postwar report, </font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"A.R.C. No. 9672: Notes on German Theoretical 
        Work on Porous Suction - all the notes taken from the examination of German 
        researches on porous materials (for which a special team of investigators had been formed)," 
        were compared with similar British work done during the war. </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The report, 
        as Vecco notes, "still bears the label 'top secret.'"<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>6</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> What the Germans were apparently trying to do was simply build a disk-shaped 
        aircraft, the entire surface of which was both the turbine intake, as 
        well as the lift surface. This was, so to speak, the "Mark I" 
        flying saucer: a standard suction aircraft, albeit, with a very unconventional 
        lift surface, which was one and the same as its fuselage and air intake. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> However, Vesco maintained more in his book, namely, 
        that the "Foo Fighters" - the strange balls of light that Allied 
        and German pilots began to see accompanying their formations near the 
        end of the war - were in fact an even more revolutionary radio-controlled 
        anti-aircraft weapon, used to jam Allied radars via very small, ceramic-cased 
        miniaturized klystron tubes, or to actually down Allied planes by firing 
        ionized gases to short out, or even explode, an aircraft's ignitions or 
        engines. In this respect, Vesco's assertions became more detailed, and 
        simultaneously, more fanciful and easily dismissed. For one thing, Vesco 
        claimed that these were secret German anti-aircraft weapons, a claim that 
        seemed to fly in the face of absurdity, since the official history of 
        their sighting never associated the loss of any Allied aircraft with them. 
        In fact, they appeared quite harmless according to all standard versions 
        of the history of their appearance. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Once again, only recently has the German perspective 
        on "Foo Fighters" been verified by a February 1945 report called 
        "<i>An Evaluation of German Capabilities in 1945</i>." This report, 
        among other things, lists a German "phoo bomb" as well as atom 
        bombs. Miniaturized klystron tubes, as well as German advances in silicon 
        and germanium crystals, two elements essential in the making of semiconductors 
        which in turn are the basis of the transistor, were actually under development 
        as well.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>7</b></font></sup> Most of this research was burned by the Germans in 
        the face of the Allied advance into the Reich, and the rest fell into 
        American hands. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And this raises a significant problem, for the miniaturization 
        of the klystron tube to a scale in some cases only a tenth as large as 
        similar tubes in the Allied inventory, raises the specter of how far the 
        Germans actually progressed in their <i>semiconductor research</i>. In any case, 
        as researcher <b>Henry Stevens</b> notes, this bit of information provides the 
        "missing provenance" to the origins of the transistor, and "explodes

        found, this assertion was apparently a fabrication, until one Dr. <b>Giuseppi 
        Belluzo</b>, indeed a specialist in steam turbines, showed up to corroborate 
        the story. Why is this significant? </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Because in 1980 the German magazine <i>Neue Presse</i> featured an article about the German fluidics engineer 
        <u>Heinrich Fleissner</u>. Fleissner was an engineer, designer and advisor to 
        what he calls a "Flugscheibe" project based at Peenemuende during 
        the war. It is interesting to note that Fleissner's area of expertise, 
        fluidics, is exactly the specialty involved in investigating problems 
        with boundary layer flow. Fleissner reports that the saucer with which 
        he was involved would have been capable of speeds up to 3,000 kilometers 
        per hour within the earth's atmosphere and up to 10,000 kilometers per 
        hour outside the earth's atmosphere. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">He states that the brains of the 
        developmental people were found in Peenemuende under the tightest secrecy. 
        .... What is of most interest to us here are three facts. First, that 
        Fleissner worked at Peenemuende on a flying saucer project. Second, that 
        a hint of this design has survived to this day. Third, the surviving design 
        can be linked to photographic evidence of German saucer, circa World War 
        Two.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>9</b></font></sup> </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Let us pause to note that according to Fleissner there 
        was a saucer project at Peenemunde and that it apparently involved the 
        "suctioned boundary layer" concept we have already discussed. 
        As we shall see, there will be an odd, little noticed connection that 
        might corroborate the existence of this program when we examine the Roswell 
        crash in the next part of this book. </font></p>

        of <u>Fleissner</u>: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Almost ten years after the war, on March 28, 1955, 
		<b>Heinrich Fleissner</b> filed a patent application with the United States Patent Office 
        for a flying saucer (<a target="_blank" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=2,939,648.PN.&amp;OS=PN/2,939,648&amp;RS=PN/2,939,648"><font color="#0000DD">Patent number 2,939,648</font></a>)....

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The engine employed 
        by Fleissner rotated around the cabin on the outside of the saucer disk 
        itself. It was set in motion by starter rockets... The difference is that 
        this engine was really a form of ram-jet engine. It featured slots running 
        around the periphery of the saucer into which air was scooped. The slots 
        continued obliquely right through the saucer disk so that jet thrust was 
        aimed slightly downward and backward from the direction of rotation. 
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Within 
        the slots, fuel injectors and a timed ignition insured a proper power 
        curve which was in accordance with the speed and direction of the saucer 
        much like an automobile's fuel injection is timed to match the firing 
        of the spark plugs. Steering was accomplished by directing the airflow 
        using internal channels contained an rudder and flaps which ran alongside 
        the central cabin. The cabin itself was held stationary or turned in the 
        desired direction of flight using a system of electromagnets and servo-motors 
        coupled with a gyroscope.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>10</b></font></sup></font></p>
		</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> But <b>Fleissner</b> was not awarded his patent until five 
        years later! The question is, why the delay? One reason for the delay 
        is that the joint Canadian-American suction-saucer project, <i>Project Silverbug</i>, 
        was also under development at the same time. Fleissner's patent was incomparably 
        superior. At about the same time as his patent was granted the Canadian-American 
        project was canceled.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>11</b></font></sup> </font></p>

		<font face="Arial" size="1">11. Ibid., p. 92.</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> But why was the 
        Fleissner design superior? Perhaps because the patent detailed the way 
        the earlier Peenemunde saucer was able to function both inside and outside 
        the atmosphere. In short, the power plant for the unusual ram-jet was 
        capable of utilizing both jet fuel for in-atmosphere flight, and once outside the 
        atmosphere, the suction vents could be closed, and the fuel shifted to 
        a mixture of liquid oxygen and hydrogen. </font></p>

		</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> But what has this to do with an Italian steam turbine 
        expert? Very simply, because when the craft was in its,</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">"rocket mode, 
        when the saucer is burning only liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, the 
        products of this combustion are only heat and water. Another way to say

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> And steam, of course, hisses, 
        a sound sometimes associated with close observation of UFOs. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> From this simple, though unconventional, configuration 
        of known technologies, the Germans would have progressed by elementary 
        science and engineering principles to the next, "Mark II," stage. 
        How could such a craft's range be extended? The answer -one which likewise 
        occurred to American physicist Thomas Townsend Brown - was that the jet 
        turbine itself could be coupled with a large electrical generator to become 
        a source of electrical power. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> With sufficient super-cooling (remember 
        Nowak's "molecular bomb"?) and sufficient electrical charge, 
        even inert gases such as nitrogen, which forms the bulk of the earth's 
        atmosphere, could be burned as fuel. Of course, while the theory is simple 
        the engineering is monstrously difficult, but the advantages were plainly 
        to be seen, </font></p>

		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The next step, "Mark III," was imply to apply already

        to this unconventional airframe.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>15</b></font></sup> Was 
        such a saucer ever actually built? An article by Jim Wilson in the November 
        2000 issue of Popular Mechanics discloses a project to design a chemical-nuclear 
        powered saucer craft for long-duration orbital missions, a craft tipped 
        with nuclear missiles and bombs. </font></p>

        very unconventional physics that the Germans may have been developing?

        saucer prototypes, saucers based on combinations of turbines, vorticular

            his detailed study of ancient mathematical doctrines and "occulted 
            physics" within ancient doctrines and philosophical texts. In 
            short, <u>Schauberger</u> was the ideal candidate, from the SS's point of 
            view, to lead a project involved with areas of physics and esoteric 
            systems that were central to the SS ideology;

        power could be constructed. This means, in effect, that quirky though 
        some of Schauberger's terminology and ideas might seem from a conventional 
        physics standpoint - he was, after all, a "naturalist" and self- 
        taught physicist and inventor - his ideas were well within the framework 
        being developed in quantum mechanics and the unusual "aether vortex" 
        theories of physicists and engineers like Hilgenberg, Krafft, or even 
        the great Gerlach himself. </font></p>
		</blockquote>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> In a nutshell, Schauberger's theories bring us to the 
        very edge of what appear to be a wartime effort - a well funded, and deeply 
        black effort - on the part of the SS to understand the relationship of 
        the zero point energy, rotating fields, and gravity. </font></p>
      <blockquote>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">1. His Basic Conceptions 
		</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Schauberger</u> began his little known and quite unconventional 
        career as an "unorthodox physicist" as a forester for the Austrian 
        government. One observation -a breathtakingly simple one -launched him 
        on his career. One day <b>Schauberger</b> observed a trout in a clear, fast moving 
        stream. The trout was stationary in the swift current, using a minimum 
        of effort to remain in place: a flick of a fin here, a small movement 
        of the tail there. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As he pondered this well-known, but little understood 
        fact, he came to the realization that the trout was using far less energy 
        to remain motionless than conventional physics would allow. After all, 
        the fish should have been swimming like crazy just to stand still. But 
        that was not all. Schauberger then wondered how the trout, again with 
        so little apparent effort and expenditure of work, could suddenly leap 
        from the water several feet, and land upstream against the current. Schauberger 
        decided to study the phenomenon. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What he found was the fish seemed somehow to employ 
        extremes of temperature to achieve their stationary place, or, conversely, 
        to leap suddenly from the water against a swift current. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As molecules "condensed", they cooled, and 
        gave off energy in the form of heat. But Schauberger added one factor 
        that brought him into the realm of the unconventional vorticular physics 
        that Hilgenberg, Gerlach, Krafft, and others in Germany were developing: 
        whenever such "condensing" took place naturally in nature, it 
        was accomplished by a spiraling motion toward the center of a vortex, 
        a form of motion he called "implosion." </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Schauberger</u> speculated 
        that, by deliberately forcing matter into such a motion, by deliberately 
        compressing it via a spiral vorticular motion, matter might reach such 
        a state that particles in atoms becomes "unglued" and transform 
        into a new form of energy. In short, what Schauberger was proposing was 
        a form of <u>cool plasma</u>, brought about by vorticular motion.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>17</b></font></sup> 
        Schauberger supplemented this idea with all manner of study of natural 
        examples of these types of spirals, well known to mathematicians to incorporate 
        the Golden Section, and the Fibonacci sequence. In his own quirky way 
        and terminology, Schauberger was talking about "cold plasmas" 
        and cold fusion, concepts well in advance of any physics of his day, conventional 
        or otherwise. </font></p>

        Living Energies: Viktor Schauberger's Brilliant Work with Natural Energy 
        Explained, pp. 30-66. </font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These ideas led <b>Schauberger</b> - like his more orthodox 
        <i>quantum mechanics</i> contemporaries - to the conclusion that energy was relatively 
        free and limitless if one only knew how to tap into it. And with extreme 
        temperature gradients, rotating media and compression of matter to an 
        intense plasma state - Schauberger thought he knew how. These ideas quickly 
        brought him to the attention of a fellow Austrian who was interested in 
        energy independence for his own reasons: Adolf Hitler. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In what surely must be one of the most surreal meetings 
        ever held between an "orthodox mainstream physicist", a political 
        leader, and an "alternative science" proponent, Schauberger 
        was invited - summoned would be a more appropriate word - to Berlin for 
        a private audience with Reichskanzler Hitler. A measure of the importance 
        that Hitler attached to this meeting may be gleaned from the fact that 
        once Schauberger had accepted Hitler's invitation, his diplomatic papers were expedited in 
        one day.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>18</b></font></sup> </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Callum Coats</u> then describes the surreal meeting:
		</font></p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Hitler.... greeted him warmly as a fellow countryman, 
        telling him that he had studied all the reports about Viktor's work thoroughly 
        and was very impressed with what he had learned. </font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Thirty minutes had been allocated for the discussions, 
        which Prof. <u>Max Planck</u> had been requested to attend as scientific adviser 
        shortly before he was rudely deposed from his position as Privy Councilor. 
        This exchange of views eventually lasted 1 1/2 hours, during which <b>Schauberger</b> 
        explained the destructive action of contemporary technology and its inevitable 
        consequences. He contrasted this with all the processes of natural motion 
        and temperature, of the vital relation between trees, water and soil productivity, 
        indeed all the things he considered had to be thoroughly understood and 
        practiced in order to create a sustainable and viable society. </font>
		</p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Viktor had finished his explanations, Max Planck, 
        who had remained silent, was asked his opinion about Viktor's natural 
        theories. His response was the remarkable and revealing statement that 
        'Science has nothing to do with Nature.' <sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>19</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><b><font size="1" face="Arial">18. Callum Coats, Living Energies, p. 
        8.<br>19. Ibid., pp. 8-9.</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nothing further came of the meeting, but the lecture 
        had undoubtedly made an impression on Hitler, if not on Max Planck. It 
        was in 1943 that Schauberger's formal contact and work on a saucer project 
        for the SS began. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">(Schauberger) was declared fit for active duty and was 
        inducted into the Waffen-SS, very much under duress. He came under the 
        control of <u>Heinrich Himmler</u>, who forced him into research to develop a 
        new secret weapon. Provided with suitable accommodation at Schloss Schonbrunn, 
        the nearby Mauthausen Concentration Camp to supply the workforce of prisoner 
        engineers, Viktor was threatened with his life if he did not comply with 
        orders and carry out this research. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In spite of these threats, however, Viktor put his foot 
        down and demanded from the SS Command the absolute right to select the 
        various engineers he needed. He further demanded that any technicians 
        he chose were to be removed entirely from the camp, fed properly, dressed 
        in normal civilian clothes and billeted in civilian accommodation, otherwise they would be unproductive. 
        As he explained, people who live in fear of their lives and under great 
        emotional stress could work neither consistently nor creatively. Surprisingly 
        the SS agreed and so Viktor selected somewhere between twenty and thirty 
        engineers, craftsmen and tradesmen front Mauthausen, to be accommodated 
        in various houses near the plant.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>20</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><b><font size="1" face="Arial">20 Coats, 
        Living Energies, p. 11. </font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is to be noted that the induction of 
		<b>Schauberger</b> 
        into the SS, the use of concentration camp labor, and the SS's behavior 
        in allowing Schauberger fall latitude to pursue his project in the manner 
        he wished, even as regards the housing of the concentration camp workers, 
        are all classic signatures of <i>Kammler's "think tank" group</i>. 
        In short, this is very strong evidence that Schauberger's team was one 
        component of the Kammlerstab. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Few of the scientists and engineers Schauberger collected 
        for his project understood what he was trying to construct. And it is 
        difficult to get a measure of just exactly what Schauberger did accomplish, 
        since all of his wartime German patents have simply disappeared, no one 
        knows where. </font></p>
		<p align="left"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">2. His Disks and Turbines 
		</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems certain, however, that Schauberger's disks 
        approached the boundary between the German "suction" saucers 
        and field propulsion craft proper, as a glance at Schauberger's own postwar 
        reconstructions of what these craft looked like will demonstrate. A postwar 
        design exists for a home electricity generator based upon a simple, though 
        quite unusual, jet turbine. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This "Tornado Generator" employed 
        a turbine that in turn was made up, not of blades, but of hollow, antelope-horn-like 
        spiraling tubes. Once air was forced into this turbine and its tubes, 
        it was then compressed, via the spiraling motion of the air through the 
        horns, until it escaped, expanded, and pushed the whole tube-turbine assembly 
        along. This expanding air was then recirculated to the turbine, where 
        it was again compressed, and so on. </font></p>

        UFO) Legend had it, the agents, who were almost certainly Counter- intelligence 
        Corps -the same outfit that had detained and interrogated Skoda's director 
        Wilhelm Voss - were remarkably well informed about his entire operation. 
        It was as if, <b>Schauberger</b> noted later, someone had guided them directly

			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Cook</b> continues: </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That night, back at my hotel, I applied myself to a 
        study of the Schauberger effect that had been written up by a researcher 
        called <u>Callum Coats</u>. I had picked up a copy of one of his books at the Schauberger institute. In it, there was a description of what happened 
        when a Repulsine was rotated at 20,000 rpm. The high rotation speeds appeared 
        to cause the air molecules passing through the turbine to pace so tightly 
        together that their molecular and nuclear binding energies were affected 
        in a way that triggered the anti-gravity effect. </font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial">'A point is reached where 
        a large number of electrons and protons with opposite charges and directions 
        of spin are forced into collision and annihilate with one another,' Coats 
        wrote. 'As lower rather than higher forms of energy and the basic building 
        blocks of atoms, they are upwardly extruded as it were out of the physical 
        and into virtual states.' </font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Virtual states? What the hell did that mean? 
			</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial">....'I stand face to face with the 
apparent "void", 
        the compression of dematerialization that we are wont to call a 
"vacuum",' 
        Schauberger had written in his diary on 14 August 1936. 'I can 
now see that we are able to create anything we wish for ourselves 
        out of this "nothing".'<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>22</b></font></sup></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That is, the vacuum for Schauberger and his rotational,

        state of matter. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In any case, one test of such a <b>Schauberger</b> saucer allegedly 
        took place in Prague in 1945, breaking loose from its test anchor, it 
        quickly flew upward hitting the roof of the building. Given the extraordinary 
        latitude accorded to Schauberger by his SS controllers - doubtless up 
        to and including <b>Kammler</b> himself - it is evident that "the German 
        scientific leadership was interested in implosion and in what Schauberger 
        had to teach them but they did not necessarily want to be limited by the 
        use of air to achieve these results. Instead, they may have wanted to 
        use Schauberger ideas but actuating these principles with electronic components.,"<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>23</b></font></sup></font></p>

			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As was seen, <b>Viktor Schauberger</b> and his unorthodox ideas 
        came to the attention of US intelligence at the end of the war. And thus 
        was launched the strangest episode in Schauberger's already strange career,

        relies upon Coats, with the exception of my interpretation of its significance. 
        Coats himself notes that the data for this period is precariously slim: 
        "Before embarking on this last and lamentable chapter in Viktor Schauberger's 
        life, I would like to state at the outset that significant and verifiable 
        detail about it is extremely difficult to ascertain, mainly because all

        away in the interim. In whatever information is available concerning this 
        tragedy, there is a profusion of conflicting statements, interpretations 
        and timetables which, 37 years after the event, makes the unraveling of 
        what precisely took place in this, for all concerned, abortive endeavour 
        rather problematic." (p. 15)</font></b></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The difficulties Schauberger 
			experienced during his stay in America were 
        similar to those he encountered first in Austria, and then later during 
        his famous visit with Hitler and Planck. </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>First</u>, being self-taught, he 
        did not possess the physicist's technical language with which to express 
        his ideas. Thus, he invented his own technical language, and often the 
        translation between the two was difficult. </font></p>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Second</u>, Schauberger having 
        already witnessed the theft and disappearance of his patents by the Nazis, 
        was understandably reluctant to be completely forthcoming to his American 
        "friends." Finally, Schauberger no longer had working prototypes 
        of any of the devices he had built.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>25</b></font></sup></font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schauberger was first brought to the attention of a 
        group of private American "investors" by one Karl Gerchsheimer, 
        who emigrated from Germany in 1922, eventually settling in Texas and marrying 
        an American wife in 1937. According to <u>Coats</u>, it appears that <u>Gerchsheimer</u> 
        became involved with the US military during World War Two in its Counter-intelligence 
        Corps, eventually becoming the man in charge of all transport, logistics, 
        and accommodation for the American army of occupation in Germany after 
        the war. He returned to the USA in 1950 and established a metal fabrication 
        company, manufacturing a number of items for NASA under contract.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>26</b></font></sup>

			<font size="1" face="Arial"><b>26. Ibid., p. 16.</b></font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In this capacity Gerchsheimer befriended wealthy American Philadelphia 
        steal magnate <b>Robert Donner</b>. Gerchsheimer's familiarity with Schauberger's 
        work, doubtless acquired during his Counter-intelligence years in Germany, 
        and his disenchantment with Dr. <b>Von Braun</b>'s rocket program, led him to 
        propose to Donner that they visit Schauberger in Germany personally, to 
        offer him the opportunity of private development of his "implosion" 
        ideas. Gerchsheimer sold the project to Dormer - an intense patriot -by 
        maintaining it would ensure American technological dominance for decades 
        to come. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A meeting in Bavaria was linally arranged between Gerchsheimer, Walter 
        Schaubcrger (Viktor's son), and Viktor. Eventually squeezing out the European 
        competition for his ideas with promises of large funding, Gerchsheimer 
        was able to persuade Viktor to come to America. As part of the contract, 
        negotiated for an American stay of three months, it was agreed that "Walter 
        Schauberger, a physicist and mathematician, was to accompany his father 
        and would be expected to stay for a year in order to assist in the scientific 
        interpretation of Viktor's ideas for which there was often no recognized 
        scientific terminology."<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>27</b></font></sup></font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Schauberger also stipulated 
        that his trusted machinist, <b>Alois Renner</b>, who had collaborated with him 
        in the construction of several of his devices, be brought to the USA as 
        well. Gerchsheimer was of the opinion, however, that Walter Schauberger 
        "neither knew nor understood much about his father's theories."<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>28</b></font></sup> 
        Eventually, the two Schaubergers flew to Dallas, and then were driven 
        to Sherman, Texas, where they were virtually interred as the "house 
        guests" of Donner associate <u>Harald W. Totten</u> on his ranch. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Gerchsheimer</u> quickly became disenchanted with Schauberger's 
        ideas, which appeared to him to be increasingly so much gobbledygook. 
        Having communicated these concerns to <b>Robert Donner</b>, who became concerned 
        for the success of his project, Donner flew to Brookhaven's National atomic 
        Research laboratories to seek expert scientific opinion. He secured the 
        services of a technician who also spoke German, <u>Eric A. Boerner</u>, who was 
        sufficiently familiar with the terminology of nuclear physics "to 
        be able to translate and transmit any information to the scientific evaluators 
        that the Schaubergers might provide."<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>29</b></font></sup></font></p>

			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Viktor Schauberger</b> spent about 10 days from August 20th 
        to August 31st writing reports to Boerner. He had been instructed to write 
        them in his own words, without regard to attempt to use "proper" 
        scientific terminology. Because of the actual physical distance between 
        the Schaubergers and Eric Boerner, and the intermediatorship of Gerchsheimer, 
        the Schaubergers gained the impression that it was Boerner himself who headed an 
        important particle accelerator project then underway at Brookhaven. And 
        this in turn magnified their fears about the possible motivations behind 
        the sudden American interest in their "implosion" concepts.
			</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Walter Schauberger</u> admitted that in the process of producing 
        their reports, it dawned on them that a bomb could possible be produced 
        through implosion that was magnitudes more powerful than the hydrogen 
        bomb. Assuming Boerner to be more influential than he was, Viktor and 
        Walter became convinced that all the information they were supplying to 
        him was being passed directly to the U.S. government and the military.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>30</b></font></sup></font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">While <b>Coats</b> himself downplays this potentiality, it 
        is worth recalling that a similar "compression-decompression" 
        principle lay behind the "molecular" bomb of Dr. <b>Nowak</b>, and 
        hence, their concerns may have come less from a misunderstanding of Boerner's 
        role, and more from an acquaintance with the work being done by the SS 
        in Nazi Germany. In any case, I do not believe it is entirely fair to 
        the Schaubergers to discount the possibility that the whole "private 
        funding" venture via Robert Donner and Karl Gerchsheimer was not 
        an operation designed to place into the hands of the US military and its 
        research facilities the fundamental outlines of Schauberger's concepts.
			</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In any case, a meeting was held on the Totten Ranch 
        in early September 1958. Present were the two Schaubergers, Robert Donner, 
        Boerner, and possibly Viktor Schauberger's machinist, Alois Renner. Based 
        principally on the reports he had received, Boerner reported to the group 
        that Project implosion was "a viable proposition." Boerner believed 
        that "the solution of the problem of energy lay in the proper interpretation 
        of Max Planck's equation E=hv, formulated in 1900, and the Freidrich Hasenohrl-Albert 
        Einstein equation E=Mc<sup>2</sup>." <sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>
			31</b></font></sup></font></p>
			<p><b><font size="1" face="Arial">30. Coats, 
        Living Energies, p. 23. </font></b></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Arial"><b>31. Ibid., p. 23. Coats rightly notes that is was first 
        Hasenohrl who had postulated the equation in 1903 in the form of m=E/c2(p. 
        29, n. 27). Hasenohrl's equation is slightly different than Einstein's 
        which is properly E=Mc<sup>2</sup>, where the capital M stands for a mass 
        difference between two observed</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial">
			</font><b><font size="1" face="Arial">masses, rather than simply a lower case "m", 
        which stands simply for mass. The point is picky, but important, as the 
        mass difference as Einstein formulated it is crucial to the point he is 
        developing in Special Relativity</font></b></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Doubtless Boerner 
        had in mind a rather remarkable paper that Walter had included in 
        his reports, a paper that related these two fundamental equations, plus 
        Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>32</b></font></sup> In any case, with 
        Viktor's health failing and his insistence to be returned to his beloved 
        Austria as quickly as possible, the situation quickly deteriorated between 
        the Schaubergers and Donner. Donner essentially held the two Austrians 
        hostage until Viktor signed a contract handing over all of his ideas, 
        inventions, and conceptions to the Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium. Only 
        with considerable pressure was Donner even persuaded to provide Viktor 
        with a German translation! Coats himself states:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have studied this document myself and it does state 
        in quite unequivocal terms that not only were all Viktor's models, sketches, 
        prototypes, reports and other data to become the sole property of the 
        Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium, but that Viktor was to commit himself 
        to total silence on anything connected with implosion thereafter.... The 
        deplorable upshot of all this, however, is that all Viktor's models, prototypes, 
        drawings, detailed data, including Professor Popel's original report implying 
        what might be termed "negative Friction" was an actuality, have 
        remained the possession of the Donner-Gerchsheimer consortium. That this 
        report was actually part and parcel of this project is confirmed by Viktor's 
        reference to it in one of his reports to Boerner dated 23/24 August 1958.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>33</b></font></sup></font></p>

        during the precise period that Nick Cook notes that all references to 
        anti-gravity research began to disappear in the British and American Press, 
        an American industrialist, with obvious ties to the defense and nuclear 
        research agencies of the USA, had successfully obtained all of the papers 
        of one of Nazi Germany's most deeply classified research projects scientists. 
        For another, it seems to indicate that there may have been more to the science 
        Schauberger had propounded than orthodox mainstream science will admit 
        to, or that the contemporary military will allow to be discussed. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In any 
        case, it is clear that Schauberger's ideas fit in quite well with the

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> This odd looking L-shaped weapon comprised 
		<i>some sort 
        of crystal</i>, then a series of hollow tubes, each focusing whatever beam 
        was generated to a narrower and narrower point, until it emerged from 
        a small hole, with allegedly deadly effectiveness, though limited range. 
        What the <u>crystal</u> was, we do not know. What sort of beam was generated, 
        we do not know, though the hollow tubes in declining ratios would seem 
        to indicate that it was some sort of acoustic wave, though why a crystal 
        would have been used is unclear. For these reasons, the weapon was usually dismissed 
        as a flight of fancy, and Stevens critiqued for 
        reproducing it. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> However, with very recall experiments and advances in 
        physics, we are in a position to conjecture what the weapon may have been, 
        and what principle the Germans may have discovered - decades early, to 
        be sure - that may have been behind its operation. An experimental, and 
        highly theoretical and mathematical paper entitled "<a target="_blank" href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/9606/9606171.pdf"><font color="#0000DD">On the Existence 
        of Undistorted Progressive Waves (UPWs) of Arbitrary Speeds 0&lt;v&lt;oo

        in October of 1997. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Investigating a class of <i>Undistorted Waves</i>, i.e., 
        a class of wave forms that do not diminish in form or force over distance, 
        they show that various solutions for these waves can be found within the 
        standard equations for such waves.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>35</b></font></sup> If this paper were merely 
        another mathematical swipe at relativity - demonstrating solutions to 
        certain equations that the "relativity police" would issue a 
        speeding ticket for - then it would be easily dismissible. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> Unfortunately, the authors' main points are not the 
        abstruse mathematical demonstrations and proofs, but rather, a method 
        for generating such waves. First noticing that solutions for Maxwell's 
        equations in a waveguide had both subluminal and superluminal solutions,<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>36</b></font></sup> 
        they went on to propose a simple method for generating and for measuring 
        the velocities of such wave structures. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"> The method was called "Finite 
        Aperture Approximation," basically, a method of squeezing acoustic 
        or longitudinal waves through a very small hole, and observing the waveform 
        interference pattern that emerged on the other side, and calculating the 
        velocity, not of the wave, but of the interference pattern itself. If 
        one knows the radius of the aperture and the strength and frequency of 
        the pulse being squeezed through it, one knows the approximate depth of 
        the Finite Aperture Approximation's resulting wave interference pattern.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>37</b></font></sup></font></p>

        a phenomenon that others would call a crucial component of <b>scalar physics</b>: 
        electromagnetic wave-interference to produce a wave-system of superluminal 
        and deadly force. They were, it seems, experimenting with some weaponized 
        form of a Finite Aperture Approximation device. <u>But why a crystal</u>? </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In 
        part, perhaps, because as is well known, crystals under stress, and acoustic bombardment would be one form of stress, 
        give off minute packets of electrical energy via the piezo-electric effect.

        as well. But beyond this allegation, is there any other indication that 
        the Germans were after exotic "post-nuclear" generation weaponry? 
        There is indeed some indication that the Germans were involved with extensive

      <blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>Experiments</u>: The experiments involved a large, 
        elaborate atom-smashing apparatus, the main features of which were four 
        "Spruehpole" (positive) and one "Fangpol" (negative), 
        each about 6 m high. Liberated protons were conveyed through a quartz 
        tube to the Spruehpole, from which they were "fired" at an object 
        placed on a quartz plate up to 800 m distant. This resulted... in 
        the complete disintegration of the object. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first two experiments of this kind ... took place 
        in Dec 43 and Jan 44. In one a 10 cm cube of steel (grade ST0012) was 
        disintegrated within four-tenths of a second, The object in the second 
        experiment was water, contained in a large quartz tube, tiled so that 
        the "rays" would strike the largest possible surface. The water 
        disappeared in two tenths of a second. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The most spectacular experiment was conducted early 
        April 1944, when some 75 rats were made to disappear in the same way. 
        The experiment was photographed from the quartz-enclosed observation tower, 
        and PW claims there was no trace of smoke or flame, nor did any ashes 
        remain on the iron plate. His explanation of this apparent violation of 
        the laws of physics is that the rats were somehow reduced to a gas, which 
        was absorbed by the iron plate. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>PW's Evaluation:</u> PW doubts that the principle 
        involved in the experiments described above could be adapted to military 
        use in less than two years. The apparatus is extremely complicated and

Schumann, it nevertheless managed to produce, or better, transduce, 
        power seemingly from nowhere. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Little is known how much farther the Germans took this 
        device, or for that matter, how far the British took it for the two decades 
        and a half after the war that they had to work on it until its declassification. 
        What is unusual is that Dr. <b>Schumann</b> was involved with secret German research 
        on "batteries" as late as 1943, and was subsequently brought 
        to the United State as part of 
		<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mj12_17.htm">
		<font color="#0000DD">Operation Paperclip</font></a>. It was this same Dr. 
        <u>Schumann</u> who had noted in 1926 that Hans Coler's device exhibited "no

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Such "free energy" devices seemed to have come very early to 
        the attention of the leadership of the Third Reich - witness the meeting 
        between Hitler, Planck, and Schauberger - and more especially to the attentions 
        of the SS. Devices involving pulsed Tesla coils, suspiciously similar 
        to Tesla's own "Impulse Magnifying Transformer" were constructed.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>49</b></font></sup></font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One such device, the so-called <i>Karl Schappeller Device</i>, 
        bears close scrutiny, since it bears resemblances to another device found 
        by <u>Nick Cook</u> and described in his <i>Hunt for Zero Point</i>. This odd device 
        is described by <b>Henry Stevens</b> as follows: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The <i>Schappeller device</i> is really composed of two separate 
        units, the rotor and the stator. The stator is constructed as follows: 
        its surface is round or ball-shaped, being composed of two half-shells 
        of steel. These half-shells contain the internal structure and are air 
        tight. Attached at each "pole" of each half-shell is an iron 
        bar magnet, most of whose structure is internal. This means that the bulk 
        of the magnet is inside the steel ball, one opposite the other. There 
        is a space between the two bar magnets at the very center of the sphere.
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Insulation, a ceramic material, is placed on the inside 
        of the steel ball leaving a hollow central area. Within this hollow area 
        and around the space between the magnets are wound two internal coils. 
        These originate at the bar magnet poles and each terminate at the center 
        of the sphere with a connection leading out of the sphere to the rotor. 
        These coils are composed of a hollow copper tube filled with a special 
        and secret substance called the "electret". Upon leaving the 
        sphere the <i>electret</i> filled copper tubes are replaced by conventional copper 
        wire. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">An electrical connection is made from the outside surface 
        of one pole to one pole of a special type of battery which is grounded 
        at the other pole... This <i>electret</i> is a permanent magnet within the sphere... 
        The actual composition of Schappeller's <i>electret</i> remains a secret but 
        another <i>electret</i> has been made by Professor <u>Mototaro Eguchi</u>. It consists 
        of carnauba wax and resin, perhaps also containing some beeswax. It was 
        kept in a strong electrical field while baking slowly until it solidified.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>50</b></font></sup></font></p>

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before proceeding to how this device allegedly operated, 
        it is important to note that this device bears strong resemblance in some 
        respects to a device called "the Bell" uncovered by <u>Nick Cook</u> 
        and his researches, covered below. Moreover, we shall see how the sum 
        total of all these strange coils, spheres, and Bells will sound only familiar 
        with devices alleged in two famous <u>UFO crashes</u> after the war. </font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Returning now to the <i>Schappeller device</i> and its operation, 
        for <b>Schappeller</b> the "neutral area", called the Bloch wall in 
        a bar magnet, where the polarity is neither "north" nor "south", 
        was of great interest and significance to Schapeller. In the Schappeller 
        device it is noted that the empty area between the two magnets corresponds 
        with this Bloch wall of neutrality.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>51</b></font></sup> It is this "neutral 
        area" that is the area electrically charged by grounding when the 
        device is put into operation. The result is a "new kind" of 
        magnetism, a glowing magnetism in which, according to Schappeller's interpreters, 
        electricity is stationary and magnetism is radiated.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>52</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the 
        Bloch Wall, "the point of zero magnetism, no spin and magnetic reversal, 
        is the point, so Schappeller theorized, energy enters and is radiated, 
        in the form of gravity. Thus, according to one interpreter, gravity is 
        a quadropole (four poles, rather than two poles), 360 degree radiated 
        push.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>53</b></font></sup></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But most astonishing about the little known Schappeller 
        were his extraordinarily revolutionary, and prescient, views on thermodynamics, 
        views that, in his day, would have had him roundly dismissed as a crackpot, 
        but some 35 years later, became an exciting new area of physics and chemistry 
        research. That area is non-equilibrium thermodynamics and systems kinetics. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Schappeller</b> had something to say about the Second Law 
        of Thermodynamics. He said there was another and unknown thermodynamic 
        cycle which runs opposite the Second Law. To name this idea we will call 
        it "<u>Reverse Thermodynamics</u>". It is the reverse of the Second 
        Law of Thermodynamics in that it leads to an increase in entropy. Not 
        only is there an increase in order by there is an increase in cold! Schappeller.... built

		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">With these thoughts in mind, we now approach what may 
        be the most sensational experiment the Germans undertook during the War. 
        The device was called simply, "The Bell", and its shocked and 
        dumbfounded discoverer was Nick Cook. </font></p>

        </font></b></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the 1960s, a movie with Glenn Ford and a young Dabney 
        Coleman, playing a small part as a government agent, was made. The movie 
        was about a secret society allegedly at work behind the scenes in American 
        society and politics, to manipulate research grants and control the direction 
        of society. In the movie, Ford plays a member of this society who is served 
        his "due bill" for all the favors the society has granted him, 
        and forced to betray a Hungarian friend in order to deny that friend a crucial 
        academic post and grant. His friend is named <i>Dr. Hlavaty</i>. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I have always thought that perhaps the movie's Dr. Hlavaty 
        was not so fictional, being perhaps based on the brilliant Hungarian physicist, 
        <b>Vaclav Hlavaty</b>, who attempted a six-dimensional solution to the Unified 
        Field Theory that had eluded Dr. Einstein. Whatever the truth of that 
        hypothesis, it is perhaps interesting to note that the "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/montauk/esp_filadelfia_5.htm"><font color="#0000DD">Brotherhood 
        of the Bell</font></a>" seemed to exist for no other purpose than to suppress 
        certain types of research, or at least, to keep it out of the public eye.
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It should come as no surprise, then, that there was 
        a "brotherhood of the Bell" during World War Two, for one of 
        the most strange objects the Germans were experimenting on was a device 
        that was known simply as "The Bell." So sensitive and secret 
        was this device, that when it was evacuated from its underground secret 
        laboratory in Lower Silesia prior to the Russian occupation of the area, 
        the SS shot the approximately 60 scientists - doubtless on Kammler's orders 
        - that were involved with this <i>strange object</i>.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>58</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><u>The Bell</u> consisted apparently of two counter-rotating 
        cylinders, and resembled a Bell in its general shape. It stood approximately 
        12 to 15 feet high, and was approximately 9 to 12 feet in diameter.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>59</b></font></sup>
		</font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>
		<font size="1" face="Arial">58 Nick Cook, The Hunt for Zero Point, 
        p. 187 For a fuller discussion of the Bell and its mysterious properties, 
        consult my Giza Death Star Deployed, pp. 121-128. </font></b></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>
		<font size="1" face="Arial">59 Cook, op. cit, pp. 191-193</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
		</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Into this device, an unknown purplish metallic-liquid looking substance 
        known only as "Xerum 525" or "Serum 525" was poured, 
        apparently to be mechanically rotated at high speed, and possibly electrically 
        rotated as well, by the device. The result was that organic objects placed 
        within the field of the Bell swiftly decayed without putrefaction, decomposing 
        into a <i>black goo</i>, and then finally, into dust, within a matter of hours, 
        and not several weeks. So strong was the field that resulted from the 
        Bell, that on its first test the technicians and scientists involved were 
        all killed. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Subsequently, <u>the Bell</u> was operated only for one or 
        two minutes at a time, and housing below ground in a room bricked and 
        tiled with ceramic tiles, which were then covered in 
        thick rubber mats. After each test, the mats were burned, and the room 
        washed down by concentration camp inmates with brine.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>60</b></font></sup> When 
        <b>Cook</b> was shown the installation in which the Bell was housed, he was also 
        informed of its high electrical consumption.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>61</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What was the mysterious "Xerum 525?" When I 
        first read of this substance which had to be stored in lead lined cylinders, 
        I first thought it sounded like a radioactive isotope of mercury, or perhaps 
        some other radioactive material suspended in solution of some sort. More 
        recently, allegations have surfaced concerning the neutron emitting properties 
        of so-called "red mercury" or <i>mercury antimonate oxide</i>, supposedly 
        a source for detonating thermonuclear warheads without the necessity for 
        detonating an atom bomb, and a powerful conventional explosive in its 
        own right. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whatever the mysterious substance was, it seems clear that 
        it was highly radioactive, and that the Germans were subjecting it to 
        extremely high mechanical and electrical rotations to study t h e resulting 
        field effects, effects that Cook's advisors could only qualify as "torsion" 
        fields.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>62</b></font></sup></font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These fields are thought by some contemporary physicists 
        to have direct relevance to the study of gravity, and of time.<sup><font color="#0000DD"><b>63</b></font></sup> 
        Close to the Bell's underground testing bunker the Germans had built a 
        large concrete henge-like structure, in the pillars of which were high 
        grade steel hooks, an obvious testing frame for what must have been an 
        extremely powerful propulsion device. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Arial">What happened to the Bell? No one knows. Like 
		<b>Kammler</b>, 
        it goes completely missing at the end of the war, and its scientists, 
        as already stated, were murdered to a man by the SS to keep whatever precious 
        secrets it, and they, had uncovered. </font></p>
