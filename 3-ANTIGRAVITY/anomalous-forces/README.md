List of anomalous force experiments:
- TT Brown (charged capacitor)
- Alexey Chekerkov
- Ziang Qiangkian
- Boyd Bushman

All the experiments seem to involve "counter-currents".

It implies that electromagnetic forces disturb the flow of aether that is caused by gravity.

All experiments indicate the movement of aether flow from negative charge to positive charge.
