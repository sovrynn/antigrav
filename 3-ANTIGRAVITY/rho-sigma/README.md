I have now come across this book mentioned a few times, also by "Chief Dinger" on X.

# Rho Sigma

Rho Sigma is the pseudonym for Rolf Schaffranke (1921-1994). He died
in Hayesville, N.C., and was buried in Stone Mountain, Georgia, per the
familysearch.org website.

Reportedly born in Austria or Germany, he allegedly may have worked
with or had some association with Wernher von Braun in Germany during World
War II.
