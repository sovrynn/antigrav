There are many. Searl, Ignatov, Grebennikov, and the following.

## ChatGPT on JL Naudin (Maurice Charles) (folder here) and Roshchin and Godin

1. Jean-Louis Naudin / Maurice Charles (“Charle”)

The “Charle” mentioned is almost certainly a distorted reference to Maurice Charles, a French experimenter sometimes linked in Russian/UFO literature to early “levitating disk” experiments.

In fringe antigravity circles, Charle is said to have experimented with rotating magnetic fields producing lift, similar to John Searl’s “Searl Effect Generator” claims.

There is little to no verifiable scientific evidence that these “Charle disks” existed, but in Russian UFO/alternative tech forums his name comes up alongside Searl, Viktor Grebennikov, and others.

2. Roshchin and Godin

Vladimir V. Roshchin and Sergey M. Godin were Russian researchers who, in the 1990s, published reports about a “magnetogravitational generator” inspired by John Searl’s “levity disks.”

In 1993–1995, they allegedly built a device with rotating magnetic drums that produced weight reduction and anomalous energy output.

Their claims appeared in Russian journals like Technika Molodezhi and later circulated online in English translations.

They reported antigravity effects (objects above the device losing weight), unusual temperature changes, and unexplained power generation.

Their work was never independently reproduced or peer-reviewed. Soon after, they stopped publishing — which, in UFO/antigravity lore, is often explained as them being “suppressed” or “silenced.”
