          QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS ELECTRICAL SCHEMATIC AND HOW IT MAY WORK</b><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><b>by Walter M. Nowosad, Jr.</b><br>
        <b>September&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 2018 / October 15, 2018</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>RUSSIAN TO ENGLISH TRANSLATION</b><b><br>
      </b>Just prior to publishing this page, I received an e-mail from
      one of my YouTube viewers, who provided a text file containing the
      full Russian to English translation.&nbsp; It has already helped
      one of our engineers in his efforts to build The Alexey Device.<br>
      <br>
      A friend off mine – Aidar Mukhametzhanov – is a&nbsp; full-time
      student and moving company business owner, who legally immigrated
      to the United States from Kazakhstan a few years ago.&nbsp; He was
      good enough to invest a few hours of his time on a weekend to help
      me understand what Alexey says in this video.&nbsp; He helped
      clarify the meaning of one component, which was confounding us;
      and, you'll read about it in the SOUND section of this page.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>A CLEAR SCHEMATIC</b><b><br>
      </b>My recreation of Alexey's Electrical schematics was
      interpreted from the video recording of his pencil drawing.&nbsp;
      I’ve omitted component values and their units-of-measure from the
      diagram; because, his labeling was either unclear and difficult to
      read, or altogether missing; and, I didn't want to be the
      authority.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/schematic.png" alt="" width="1280" height="720"><br>
      <b>MOTORS</b><b><br>
      </b>They appear to be lightweight pancake motors, akin to computer
      cooling fans.&nbsp; The lower motor could be a bathroom
      ventilation fan.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>CAPACITORS</b><b><br>
      </b>Symbols for electrolytic capacitors appear in circuits that
      may, or should be, some flavor of AC.&nbsp; Unless my memory from
      electronics school fails me, these types of capacitors are
      intended for DC-only circuits.&nbsp; If it's pulsed DC may be
      another issue to consider.&nbsp; It was difficult to read the
      polarity for C2.&nbsp; If it’s on an AC circuit, then the
      wrong&nbsp; capacitor symbol was used.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>RESISTORS</b><b><br>
      </b>The few resistor values appearing in Alexey's schematic were
      relatively easy to read; however, not all resistors included a
      value or unit-of-measure – ? vs. K? vs. M?, etc.&nbsp; so, I've
      omitted the values.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS</b><br>
      The schematic contains six transistors.&nbsp; Two numbers appear
      near one transistor at the base of the Tesla Coil's L2.&nbsp; One
      is a Russian transistor part number (KT819) and the other number –
      250843 – could either be read as 2508Hz or 250843.&nbsp; During
      the team's Skype call (notes to below), we came to a consensus
      it’s 250,843, which would roughly represent 250 KV or 250
      KHz.&nbsp; Two more Russian transistor part numbers KT838 and KT
      815 appear beneath the transformer I've labeled TR1.&nbsp; This
      website shows equivalent Western part numbers. I’ve provided links
      to transistor data sheets, below.&nbsp; I was unable to locate a
      Western equivalent for KT838 and discovered some of them are
      obsolete.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/transistorbaseatteslacoil.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="215">&nbsp;<br>
      </div>
      <b>RUSSIAN PART NUMBER&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp; WESTERN EQUIVALENT PART
        NUMBER</b><b><br>
      </b>KT838; KT38A&nbsp; /&nbsp; UNKNOWN<br>
      KT815&nbsp;&nbsp; /&nbsp; BD165<br>
      KT819 (Same as KT 818G, but with n-p-n structure)&nbsp; /&nbsp;
      BDY20, BDY23<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>VOLTAGE SOURCES</b><b><br>
      </b>The voltage values scribbled on the left could be 24V and 12V
      – can’t say for sure.&nbsp; The flavor of waveform Alexey applies
      is not specified; however, given images appearing in his video,
      the Tesla Coil L1 may be receiving a square wave from a switching
      power supply.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/powersource1.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="137">&nbsp;<br>
      </div>
      <b>POWER SUPPLIES AND "KATCHER"</b><b><br>
      </b>Throughout the video and in the comments section, I see
      repeated references to the “Katcher”.&nbsp; My best guess is that
      the power supply and circuit feeding the Tesla Coil is the
      "Katcher".&nbsp; In fact, you'll find imprinted on the black box
      “Switching Power Supply”.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/katcherpowersupply_300px.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167"><br>
      </div>
      <b>12 V STARTER BATTERY</b><b><br>
      </b>Alexey says, “And this lead is only powering high-voltage
      power supply”.&nbsp; His schematic indicates two sources of high
      voltage from two different power supplies.&nbsp; Perhaps the 12 V
      Starter Battery is feeding the two white boxes.&nbsp; See the
      white text against a green field, “Two Boxes for powering
      discs”.&nbsp; We are unable to see all sides of them to determine
      interconnections.&nbsp; What’s contained inside is unknown.<br>
      <br>
      Later, the video shows Alexey disconnecting a white lead from the
      12V / 44 Ah / 360 CCA starter-battery.&nbsp; The video whip-pans
      to reveal his device hanging in the sky for several seconds until
      everything discharges; and, it drops to the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Source voltage values are difficlut to identify from Alexey’s
      pencil drawing.&nbsp; Have I incorrectly interpreted the top right
      source to be&nbsp; 24V?&nbsp; Should it be a 12 VDC starter
      battery?&nbsp; Is the starter battery we see the sole source of
      power for all three circuits?<br>
      <br>
      1) Two motors &amp; a piezoelectric ultrasonic sound generator
      sharing one circuit;<br>
      2) one Tesla coil primary feeding stepped-up high voltage via its
      secondary to the center fixed disc; and,<br>
      3) a “magnifying” circuit, which sources high voltage to the
      spinning plates.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/powersourceforhvpowersupply_300px.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168"> <br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <b>LIGHTNING ARRESTOR (SPARK GAP) ON A DC CIRCUIT</b><b><br>
      </b>What is the purpose of the circuit that contains transformer
      TR2?&nbsp; What is the function of the spark gap connected to
      TR2’s secondary, when its primary sees a 12 V DC signal from a
      Battery?&nbsp; My friend, who translated Alexey’s Russian, says
      this circuit powers a piezoelectric ultrasonic sound
      generator.&nbsp; When the sound interacts with the "special metal"
      (textured metal), you have levitation.&nbsp; The sound of a
      beetle’s beating wings interacts with the rough under-texture of
      its wing covers, which levitates the bug; so, the special metal
      –&nbsp; rough, textured,&nbsp; and bumpy – represents the beetle's
      rough under-surface, and the ultrasonic sound generator represents
      the beetle's vibrating wings.&nbsp; This is Alexey's&nbsp; nod to
      Viktor Grebennikov.&nbsp; Alexey doesn’t say what kind of metal it
      is or where it came from.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/transformer.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="228"><br>
      </div>
      <b>ULTRASONIC SOUND</b><b><br>
      </b>The ultrasonic sound generator is most likely physically
      positioned above the top motor and hidden under what appears to be
      a plastic dome, which could be a reflector scavenged from a large
      flashlight.<br>
      <br>
      Could the dome we see on top be an inverted ultrasonic piezo
      speaker?&nbsp; I searched the Internet and found several; but,
      none of them resembled Alexey’s dome.&nbsp; We simply don’t know
      what’s underneath.<br>
      <br>
      Could the Alexey device operate on sound alone?&nbsp; If so, could
      it operate in a vacuum?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; What else could be
      used in place of sound - perhaps UV light, as suggested by William
      R. Lyne in his book, Pentagon Aliens, 3rd Edition?&nbsp; Note the
      external arching waves (left), analogous to sound waves – are
      these U.V. light resonators?<br>
      <br>
      According to my Russian-English interpreter friend, Alexey says
      the device's voltages, frequencies, and ultrasonic sound must be
      in resonance.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/domeontop.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207">&nbsp;<br>
      </div>
      <b>SPECIAL METAL</b><b><br>
      </b>When Alexey says he uses special metal, the metal is
      considered special because it’s textured.<br>
      <br>
      One of our engineers recommended William R. Lyne’s book, Pentagon
      Aliens, 3rd Edition – and I can’t put it down. In it, he mentions
      quilted aluminum, which apparently was the crisscross ridge
      patterns of early stealth technology developed by the Germans
      during for their WWII U-boats, and adapted to the saucers.&nbsp;
      Friends of the author described seeing this pattern on UFOs.&nbsp;
      This brought Alexey’s mysterious metal to mind.&nbsp; A few
      seconds on Google; and, voilà!&nbsp; I find rigidized metal: Some
      suppliers call it Stucco metal.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I've overlaid a closeup image of the Device's special metal with
      Sample 1SLG.&nbsp; They look similar.&nbsp; According to this
      website, this texture is available in stainless steel and other
      metals.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/specialmetalcompare.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="353"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <b>COPPER SLIDING CONTACTS (BRUSHES)</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;The contacts (a strip of copper) provide a conductive
      path to carry a single polarity high-voltage pulsed charge to the
      spinning discs (positive on the top disc; and negative on the
      bottom disc).<br>
      <br>
      How much voltage should the brushes be feeding the upper and lower
      rotating discs?&nbsp; According to my friend who translated
      Russian to English, the circuit following TR1's secondary
      “magnifies”.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/copperbrush.png" alt="" width="300" height="169">&nbsp;<br>
      </div>
      <b>MAGNETS</b><b><br>
      </b>Alexey’s drawing shows magnets mounted to one disk only; but,
      the device has magnets mounted to both discs.&nbsp; My drawing
      shows this.&nbsp; I assume north poles face each other.&nbsp; The
      functional purpose of the magnets are unknown - perhaps to channel
      the electric and magnetic fields into a spinning vortex?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>POLARITIES - ELECTRIC CHARGE AND MAGNETIC POLES</b><b><br>
      </b>While he admits he may not be using the right words in his
      explanation, Alexey rationalized the lower spinning disc should be
      negatively charged ~ to Earth.&nbsp; He continues by describing
      vortex fields spinning upward and downward from the rotating
      disks, which excludes it from Earth’s gravity; but, he stops short
      of describing the magnets' orientation.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>HIGH VOLTAGE CHARGES</b><b><br>
      </b>The middle stationary plate – charged by the Tesla coil – may
      act as an electric barrier to separate fields created by the
      high-voltage charged upper and lower rotating plates.&nbsp; One of
      our team members speculates its purpose may be to prevent the
      opposing polarities and fields from mixing and being
      neutralized.&nbsp; Alexey says everything must be in resonance –
      all three charged plates and the ultrasonic sound or vibration.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>TWO DEVICES</b><b><br>
      </b>Alexey features at least two devices on his YouTube
      channel.&nbsp; The one pictured here is not the same used in his
      indoor and outdoor video demonstrations.&nbsp; It is smaller in
      diameter, lighter weight; and, the discs are not made from a
      “special metal”.&nbsp; According to my translator, they’re CDROM
      discs!<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/device02.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"> <img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/device01.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169">&nbsp;<img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/device02a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169"> <br>
        <br>
      </div>
      At the time Alexey recorded the schematics video, this device was
      still in construction.&nbsp; Both discs appear opaque, as if
      coated with something; yet, in a higher camera angle; the disc
      appears to be transparent.&nbsp; Is this a trick of light and
      shadow?<br>
      <br>
      With a copper contact in direct contact with the upper and lower
      rotating CDROM discs.&nbsp; We speculated the foil aluminum
      encased in the layers of polycarbonate may interact with the high
      voltage charge.<br>
      <br>
      Since the copper brush is not in direct contact with a conductive
      plate, assuming the disc is not coated or sprayed with conductive
      materials and the only conductor present would be sandwiched
      between 1.2 mm of polycarbonate plastic (an insulator), if the
      goal is to apply a high voltage charge to the extremely thin layer
      of embedded aluminum, would breakdown voltage of 1.2 mm of
      polycarbonate material need to be taken into consideration prior
      to testing?&nbsp; How will the aluminum react to the pulsed
      charge?&nbsp; Will it heat up, expand, and cause the disc to come
      apart?<br>
      <br>
      The upper rotating disc appears to be transparent from the high
      camera angle. If you’ve ever purchased sleeves of CDs or DVDs,
      you’ll know they ship with a clear plastic packaging insert at the
      top and bottom of the sleeve, which does not contain
      aluminum.&nbsp; Is that what Alexey is using here?&nbsp; If so,
      how will the rotating polycarbonate plastic discs receive a high
      voltage charge?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>WIRING AND ELECTRICAL ISOLATION</b><b><br>
      </b>A set of black and white wires and connection blocks are on
      top.&nbsp; The piezoelectric ultrasound device is absent.&nbsp;
      These four wires could be feeding power to both motors and the
      Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Sound Generator.&nbsp; Note the black
      triangles bolted to the lower stationary plate.&nbsp; Could these
      be insulators electrically restricting the high voltage charge to
      the center stationary disc?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>WHAT'S NEXT?</b><b><br>
      </b>Alexey says his next video will show how he tunes the
      circuits.&nbsp; As mentioned in an other video, it takes Alexey
      thirty to sixty minutes to tune the device.<br>
      <br>
      During my Russian to English translation session I also got this:
      Too much high-voltage can prevent levitation.&nbsp; Who knows what
      other variables factor into the equation?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>TEAM SKYPE CALL: September 15, 2018</b><b><br>
      </b>During our call, we had another long-time pod member join us;
      and, we stepped through Alexey’s circuit and how we think it’s
      designed to.&nbsp; We discussed wave forms, such as a pulsed
      half-wave riding on an offset DC signal – positive at the upper
      and negative at the lower.&nbsp; The waveform could be square, or
      other. It could be in phase, or a number of degrees out of phase.
      We simply don’t know.<br>
      <br>
      The signals at all three plates receive some flavor of pulsed DC.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="Alexey%20Chekurkov%20Graviflyer%20--%20Levitation%20device%20schematics,%20video,%20&amp;c_files/waveforms.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="152"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Power source values are in question.<br>
      <br>
      We pondered how Alexey’s circuit, as drawn, would be tuned for
      resonance or adjusted to ascend and descend.<br>
      <br>
      Based on his circuit, it appears voltage and current values are
      the only adjustable variables.&nbsp; VR1 would vary current.&nbsp;
      My transistor knowledge is a little fuzzy; but, as I recall,
      depending on how the transistor is biased, changes in current
      and/or voltage affects frequency – the relationship may be
      inversely proportionate – as current increases, frequency
      decreases; and as current decreases, frequency increases.&nbsp;
      The amplitude of the signal varies with adjustments, as well; not
      to mention, the transistors would have to be capable of
      accommodating certain voltages, current, frequencies, etc.&nbsp;
      Again, I’m rusty on this stuff.<br>
      <br>
      We pondered, what’s missing?&nbsp; Is Alexey hiding
      something?&nbsp; Is he concealing other control knobs or
      circuits?&nbsp; It was suggested as workaround to his circuitry:
      Rather than constructing your own Tesla coils, buy one
      off-the-shelf.&nbsp; For your High Voltage source leading to the
      rotating plates, it was suggested a neon sign transformer and a
      Variac – to enable tuning – could be used.<br>
      <br>
      We attempted to identify electrical components appearing in one of
      Alexey’s previous videos.&nbsp; As shown here, there were four
      boxes – a black-colored metal box referred to as a “Katcher”
      (switching power supply), which apparently drives the Tesla coil;
      a white thing sporting a large dial (a dimmer / pot); a white and

        </b></a>&nbsp;<br>
      The practical concept of reaction-less force and Newton’s 3rd law<br>
      <br>
      Before starting the description we should clarify briefly the
      issue, what does the violation of Newton’s 3rd law mean, and
      define the concept of reaction-less force. According to our
      everyday experiences, forces are exerted upon a body either by
      physical matter through direct mechanical contact, or by force
      fields that are originating also from physical matter. Thus the
      force-field acts as a mediator medium between the two bodies made
      of physical matter and it develops an action and reaction in
      distance, but the forces seem to be the same as if the bodies
      would act upon each other through direct mechanical contact.<br>
      <br>
      Newton’s 3rd law declares that if a physical body acts upon a
      second physical body with force a F then the second body will also
      act upon the first body with a force of same magnitude but
      opposite direction –F. That means, if there is an active force
      tending to accelerate a body then there must also exist another
      reaction force of same magnitude and opposite direction acting on
      a second body, and there cannot exist an active force without a
      reaction force.<br>
      <br>
      If there would be such force then we could call it a reaction-less
      force, since it does not require any reaction force, or the
      presence of a second body (to react) in order to be active and
      accelerate a physical body. According to this interpretation if we
      measure a unidirectional electrostatic force (developed by the
      E-field) upon a thruster, we can call it reaction-less since it
      does not develop any reaction force upon physical matter and it
      does not require the existence of a second physical body in order
      to be active and be able to accelerate the thruster. This active
      force is originating from the electric force field and thus we
      might expect that consequently the reaction force should be
      transferred to the physical matter that creates this field (to
      electric charges, and from them to the atoms of a body); the law
      of action-reaction between physical bodies should still remain
      valid. However, in the case of E-field thrusters the sources of
      the accelerating E-field are the same charges that are present on
      the surface of the electrodes and the reaction force would act on
      these charges counteracting the active accelerating force. Thus no
      resultant thrust would exist on a thruster without the presence of
      external force fields and physical bodies. If we still prove that
      a resultant unidirectional thrust can exist upon a thruster that
      does not originates from external medium then it is justified to
      call it reaction-less since from a physical and practical point of
      view the reaction force does not manifest in the perceived rough
      physical dimension.<br>
      <br>
      The force fields are special manifestations, energetic states of
      the background ether, and they are part of the ‘ether sea’ in
      which all matter flows. Thus they can lean upon this subtle fluid
      substance that represents a reaction background to interact with
      physical matter. Now we could say that we have found the reaction
      background and the law of action-reaction is still valid, since
      the force-field (i.e. the ether) bears the reaction force that
      should have the same magnitude as the action force upon the
      thruster. However, the substance of the reaction background (the
      ether) belongs to a more subtle dimension, and it is not a rough
      physical matter that would have the same characteristics as the
      well known physical matter. Therefore from practical point of view
      we can still call the discussed thrust ‘reaction-less’ within the
      rough physical dimension (or frame of reference) to differentiate
      it from the usual forces that always invoke a reaction force upon
      physical bodies.<br>

      "Special Metal" is unknown.&nbsp; It looks like hammered tin, or
      an aluminum/bismuth alloy, hand-forged.&nbsp; It looks coated;
      plated, and easy to machine.&nbsp; It is known that the disks may
      become magnetized, meaning it is a ferrous alloy.&nbsp; It won't
      work when the disks are magnetized, probably causing a problem
      with spinning, or otherwise electrical disruption due to homopolar
      motor effects back-feeding into the external high voltage power
      supply.<br>
      <br>
      He does have a lot of that metal on hand, however.&nbsp; He has
      made other apparatus from that metal, as per links below.&nbsp; It
      resembles an iron / tin allow for corrugated roofs with perhaps, a
      galvanized zinc plating.<br>
      <br>
      It would most probably be a standard type of easily-acquirable
      metal.<br>
      <br>
      Also note the power supply in the video below, using a Tesla
      resonance transformer.&nbsp; His standard power supplies however
      are using "positive energy," rather; whereas these metal disks are
      essentially rotating air capacitors.&nbsp; Being able to conduct
      magneto-electrostatic fields and usage of the Tesla resonance
      transformer denote that they are charged as a field at high volts,
      using non-standard electromagnetic (positive) energy; and the
      electromagnetic energy from the transformers would be going toward
      powering the motors that spin the disks, not using homopolar motor
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      ​Note the blending of the energies of magneto-electrostatic and
      electromagnetic in high volts.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, he uses neodymium magnets in the positions of the
      utrons near the outsides of his lower disk.&nbsp; The magnetic
      field near the outside while spinning them, denotes the
      electromagnetic collapse of magnetism toward the center -- in that
      field geometry.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      This begs the question of the utrons being magnetic, whereas the
      outer electromagnets of the X1 collapse somehow in timing with the
      passing utrons, and a coil around the utrons could be built to
      handle that collapsed energy in polarity opposite of the
      utron-magnet, to deaden or cancel the utron's magnetic field in
      order to pass through the electromagnetic gate.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Aside from that complex structure, a homopolar motor design with
      electrostatic rotating disks may actually be able to handle
      rotating magnets spinning in the opposite direction of one of two
      counter-rotating field disks; it seems that the rotating magnetic
      fields are only traveling in one direction.<br>
      <br>
      It's easy to see the device comprised of two capacitor sets, one
      on top (with lower rotating disk), and one on the bottom, with
      lower rotating disk with magnets.&nbsp; He is NOT using homopolar
      motor technology, and he's using an external Tesla coil power
      supply, instead of integrating that into his design, although it
      is using a conductive hollow "hat" similar to a Tesla
      tower.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note the static disk, rather the disk that
      is not moving, with the frame "landing legs" sticking through it.<br>
      <br>
      Note the bottom rotating disk is wider than the upper rotating
      disk, keeping to principles of the magnet and dielectric layers,
      using a wider magnet on bottom and on upper magnet, in less width,
      in adherence with the Townsend Brown in a vacuum test shown on the
      pdf file on the Construction page in the Townsend Brown section.<br>
      <br>
      Part of it is powered through a Tesla resonance coil.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some of Alexey's comments:<br>
      <br>
      "A new lightening disk was made and a video was shot. But someone
      influential complained and yutub blocked the roller. But one user
      managed to download and reapply but again called feykovy flight.
      He decided that if the terminal with akamulyatora removed means
      fake. But I explained that from time to time you need to remove
      the power from the TDX to prevent the magnetization of the disks
      and prevent the subsidence of the parameters. If you have not seen
      the movie, I'll throw the link."<br>
      <br>
      "This corrugated aluminum with an anodized coating structure
      similar to the beetle fenders. So successfully
      coincided."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Guess I need to mention Alexey mentioned in a comment on one of
      his bug wing videos what the material is -- the anodized
      corrugated aluminum. I spent hours translating Russian into
      English and searching.<br>
      ​<br>
      This represents the first successful testing of the rotating and
      counter-rotating charge antigravity craft, able to lift a
      considerable amount of weight, and when applied in an air-tight
      resonance cavity hull may also work in a vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      So now we know that the rotating and counter-rotating charge
      principle of physics DOES WORK.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>PART II</b><br>
      <br>
      I want to take some still-shots of the videos, and notes, to have
      a photo reference, just in case, because Alexey mentioned that his
      prior videos were removed from YouTube in order to suppress the
      technology.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      He uses modified high voltage power supply from switching power
      supply for his original test.&nbsp; The first disk is powered up
      using a standard motor, plugged into a wall socket (power strip)
      which gets it to spin, as is the second disk.&nbsp; The disks are
      mounted to stationary frame (stationary disk), which the two
      motors are bolted to.&nbsp; The disks are arranged as capacitors,
      so the presence of unmoving disks in the engine will not cause it
      not to work.<br>
      <br>
      After the two disks (the one on the very bottom, and the second
      one from the top) are spinning in opposite directions, most
      definitely.&nbsp; You can adjust your video settings for high
      quality to see better.&nbsp; The next step is to connect the high
      voltage power supply (after all, as I've said before, all forms of
      electrogravity use high voltage).&nbsp; In the OTC-X1, that is
      achieved through high volt flyback from the electromagnets.<br>
      <br>
      Okay.&nbsp; The high voltage is plugged into the stationary disks
      by the looks of things, and the rotating disks picks up one
      polarity of the dielectric charges, but both stationary disks are
      on top of the rotating disks, so the orientation typically used is
      positive up and negative on bottom.&nbsp; If using positive on the
      bottom, it would be repulsive to the Earth surface charge, and not
      achieve significant height, in my opinion.<br>
      <br>
      The orientation of negative on bottom and positive on top
      effectively means that the co-counter-rotating disks are spinning
      positive against negative, looking at this in the form of
      capacitor geometry.&nbsp; His high voltage source is the typical
      high voltage transformer from a CRT tube and improvised voltage
      multiplier (positive energy high volts, just like most people do
      with their electrostatic lifters).&nbsp; You can hear the
      zzzzzaping when he plugs in the voltage multiplier.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      ​High voltage supply is the box in the middle photo.&nbsp;
      Multiplier is the hand-held device on the floor in the right
      photo.<br>
      <br>
      He says the high voltage performs the "magnetization of
      sectors."&nbsp; It's in Russian, but there is an English
      translation.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Voltage and speed&nbsp; (inertial frequency).<br>
      <br>
      The bottom left is levitating.&nbsp; Bottom middle is side
      profile.&nbsp; Bottom right is the bottom of the engine, and those
      are the 6 neodymium magnets.<br>
      ​<br>
      <b>PART III</b><br>
      <br>
      Okay so here is the successful test model version 2.<br>
      <br>
      The mess on the left is the power supply.&nbsp; Tesla resonance
      transformer, and immediately to its right is the power supply for
      it.&nbsp; The box on the far right is the independent power supply
      for the transformer block, and the little white box on top of the
      big white box is the high volt power supply.&nbsp; It's all
      connected to the 12 volt battery.&nbsp; I'm recording this for
      posterity, just in case.<br>
      <br>
      Alexey continues to explain that a conflict of sequences steps
      caused his previous model to fall down, and he has to do a lot of
      fancy adjustments to get the craft to go up in the air, and
      sometimes it may take 30 minutes to balance everything
      correctly.&nbsp; Basically he explains that his power supply
      system has to be charged up in a certain order, probably due to
      resonance, like how a capacitor has to be charged first in a basic
      LC circuit (see the article below), and then when resonance starts
      to break down, he needs to provide an input to the capacitors, but
      it ends up going to the wrong place (the transformer instead of
      the capacitors), and his high voltage signal starts to degrade.<br>
      <br>
      I don't want to speculate here too much about his power system,
      though.&nbsp; Not yet.<br>
      <br>
      The second device, his working prototype is impressive, and
      obviously upgraded from the first, yet still having the same
      overall characteristics, and using better field geometry.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We know now that he is using corrugated aluminum with an anodized
      coating, which was the same material he used for the CSE beetle
      (sound resonance cavity) experiments, from the Russian etymologist
      years ago who discovered that effect.&nbsp; The piece he is
      touching is the upper rotating disk.&nbsp; This is awesome!&nbsp;
      It's like a TR-3B engine (1 of 3 on the triangular hull's
      tips).&nbsp; Just think how this style can be adopted to use a
      homopolar motor design instead of dipole standard electric motors.<br>
      <br>
      Here below is a better view of the whole top.&nbsp; The special
      field is theorized in different ways.&nbsp; One theory is a
      positive and negative electrical mass cancellation.&nbsp;
      Otherwise it's not very well known how it works to be
      honest.&nbsp; If you consider electromagnetic spin reverses on
      either side, up and down, left and right within orientation to
      electric fields relative to a plane of gravity, then the spin one
      way and spin the other way seems to cancel gravity, along the
      middle and much wider disk plane.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Magnets are involved, however.&nbsp; In fact, the article below
      this one showing the little diagram of the outer electromagnets in
      homopolar motor configuration spinning two disks in opposite
      directions is similar but I REALLY LOVE the concept of the
      centralized wider disk in Alexey's application.&nbsp; Similar to
      magneto-electrostatic, or just static electricity with the two
      counter-rotating disks creating electrostatic friction on the
      central wide disk.&nbsp; The two rotating disks appear similar in
      size.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      ​If you notice also where the high volt top disk is, it is
      connected via frame to the central disk, but later on it shows
      Alexey touching the legs of the device during levitation, and
      touching the bottom middle.<br>
      <br>
      He uses three wires:&nbsp; one high volt from the Tesla resonance
      transformer, and two wires from the rotating disks.&nbsp; I would
      say he is using a homopolar motor design in this version, due to
      only two wires to handle the rotating disks, and the third as the
      high volt magneto-electrostatic feed.&nbsp; <br>
