Oh no, bro — we can’t hear you. Check your mute button. Okay, now we hear you. Alex, you dropped out for a second.

Alex was saying that he managed to set up the “Gravelot.” We can start it up, but it’s a long procedure, so get your cups ready. It’ll take some time. He managed to put the pieces together just for this meeting. That’s exactly why he and I are starting to move into electric discs — we believe they’ll have much greater power and take off much quicker. But of course, we also want to see some magic here, so let’s see how that goes.

The “Gravelot” name is cool, it represents the model well. In the background, we’re also working on the “Granov” platform. For now, we’re excluding the control mechanisms to keep things simple, since right now the main focus is just liftoff. We have most of the body parts already, we just need to assemble them, attach them to a high-voltage generator, and see if it takes off. Thanks to modern technology, we should be able to get better results.

Alex is starting things up. That box he’s showing is a high-voltage generator. For now, he’s pulling power directly from a wall socket in his house, then distributing it through this generator.

The main box he’s holding is an ultrasonic generator. It manipulates frequency, though unfortunately it doesn’t have a screen to show precise numbers. He’s working with a simple 1-to-3 scale, making small adjustments that result in big changes in frequency.

Another box directly shows the voltage running to the electric motors. From the small control box, there are two buttons: the top button sends power to the motors, and the bottom button activates the ultrasonic generator. A thick white cable splits into four wires: two go into the motor, and two go to the ultrasonic generator.

For the central disc, a thin wire connects to a Tesla coil. If the Gravelot is far away — say 50 meters — the cable has to go deep inside to carry enough energy. If it’s close, just a short insertion works. Right now, he’s got it about 50 cm in. The cable itself is around 2–3 meters long.

Alex explained that he hasn’t tested this exact setup yet. He’s checked the instruments and boxes, but he doesn’t know if it will take off. That’s part of the experiment today. It might take about an hour.

First, he activates the motors so the discs start rotating. The idea is that rotating discs generate a torus field. On their own, these fields are weak, so to boost them they also use an electromagnetic disc. Both discs rotate in opposite directions — the bottom one counter-clockwise, the top one clockwise. Once rotating, energy builds and a torus field starts to form.

After three or four minutes, he slowly increases the electrical input over a period of 15 minutes. This controlled build-up prevents short circuits or explosions, since the wires are under high voltage but only lightly attached.

Next, he activates the Tesla coil — the “catcher.” This directs energy into the central stationary disc. The catcher’s knob regulates frequency, which has to bring both rotating discs into resonance. This is tricky, because there’s no precise measurement system, so it’s based on careful tuning and listening for cues like humming sounds.

Once the catcher is engaged, the ultrasonic generator is also activated. Both must be regulated together — the catcher’s amplitude is adjusted up and down quickly, while the ultrasonic generator is increased slowly. When tuned correctly, the fields stabilize. At that point, Alex quickly toggles the ultrasonic generator on and off in a specific sequence (three to five times) to force resonance. If successful, the Gravelot should lift off.

If it fails or tilts, everything must be powered down, and they wait 10–15 minutes for the fields to dissipate before trying again.

Alex also mentioned some of his esoteric training — exercises to sense energy fields, like rubbing hands together to feel warmth or waves between palms. Over time, this discipline helps him sense torus fields around the Gravelot. He compared these to natural fields around the human body.

During tuning, he listens for the faint humming that indicates resonance. That’s the moment to trigger the ultrasonic generator toggling sequence. It takes patience, but with the right adjustments, the fields can be stabilized and — hopefully — generate lift.

The generator is now on. Over the next 10–15 minutes, the electrical energy fed into the rotating discs will be increased gradually.

Alex explained that weather plays a role in disc spacing. In winter, when it’s cold, the discs need to be closer together. In hot summer conditions — like in Africa — they should be set farther apart. Ultimately, it’s determined by testing. First, though, the correct frequency values for the generator and the ultrasonic “catcher” must be established.

Someone asked: Does the required ultrasound frequency tend to be lower in winter and higher in summer?
Alex confirmed: yes — in winter, lower frequencies are sufficient; in summer, higher frequency and amplitude are needed, especially because the discs are farther apart.

They resumed increasing the energy on the rotating discs. Alex noted that the most difficult part is catching the “humming moment” of the catcher. Once that hum is heard, the ultrasonic generator must be toggled on and off quickly. Each press creates a pulsing wave on the piezoelectric element, which is what drives resonance. Patience is required, though better instruments with frequency displays would simplify tuning.

There was discussion about adding a handheld measuring device. With a probe clipped onto the ultrasonic wire, Alex could record the exact frequencies when lift occurs. This way, after achieving flight, he could shut everything off, then turn on one system at a time and measure the precise frequencies used. That data would allow more accurate replication and tuning in future attempts. The device would cost less than $200 and could save considerable trial and error.

Alex also increased energy through the high-voltage generator. To prevent dangerous sparking, he already installed a limiter inside — the maximum output is capped at 16 kilovolts. The special wires used can individually handle around 6 kilovolts, but when separated into two wires instead of one cable, they’ve successfully carried 16 kV without shorting.

Next, Alex turned on the catcher, adjusting amplitude up and down for several minutes before activating the ultrasonic generator. He asked for silence to focus during tuning.

When the humming moment arrived, he toggled the ultrasonic generator slightly late, but still got a good response. The discs appeared to speed up. He explained that when the fields stabilize, the central disc becomes almost weightless — gravity seems nullified — and that contributes to the lift effect.

There was discussion about building identical Gravolot kits so multiple people could test on the same hardware. They agreed it would help to professionalize things with more precise instruments and logging of exact frequencies.

At one point, the craft nearly tilted and lifted on one side. The attempt caused Alex’s Wi-Fi and computer to crash, likely from an EMP effect produced when the fields collapsed suddenly. This supported his earlier claim that recording the craft in flight is difficult — electronics nearby often fail when it lifts off.

The team suggested increasing camera distance, perhaps using a GoPro or simply an iPhone on a stand plugged into power. That way, full tuning sessions could be recorded even if they last hours.

They also discussed moving toward electric discs with positive and negative charge separation. Adding fiberglass layers could improve durability without disrupting fields significantly. This technique is similar to how bulletproof plates or carbon-fiber composites are made.

Later, they compared their system’s stored energy to other experimental designs. One Russian inventor reportedly built a craft that used “atomic-level” energy storage within special disc materials, achieving powerful liftoff with just a drill to spin the center disc. His discs contained internal crystalline rods that absorbed etheric energy and redirected it into strong toroidal fields.

Back with the Gravolot, Alex continued tuning. The team noted that when resonance is reached, eddy currents in the central disc combine with ultrasonic vibration from the top disc, accelerating it. The bottom disc stays steady, but the top disc speeds up dramatically.

During one attempt, the Gravolot tilted — almost lifting off. This was considered a success, since such movement hadn’t been achieved before. However, the EMP effect shut down Alex’s Wi-Fi and even caused his computer to blue-screen, requiring repair.

They concluded the meeting by agreeing to schedule the next session at least 24 hours later, once Alex’s computer is repaired. Everyone was excited by the progress — the craft nearly lifted off, they gathered useful data, and they have a clearer plan:

Use fiberglass-reinforced electric discs for durability.

Acquire a frequency probe device to record exact resonance values.

Improve video recording setup at a safe distance.

Continue gradual, careful tuning toward full liftoff.

They closed with optimism: “We’ve seen real progress today. Next step is making it fly fully.”

oh no bro hey we can't hear it bro we can't
0:12
hear you mute button mute amazing is video break yet yeah yeah I
0:19
can hear you oh Alex you dropped out
0:36
yes oh oh my God no no the EMP no Pro no wait wait
0:46
but his phone video is still on let me call him let me call him uh what Alex is mentioning he managed
0:51
to set up the gravelot and sort of we can start it up but it might take some
0:58
it's a long procedure so get your cups ready it might take some time for it to take
1:12
off manag to put the pieces together just for this meeting just that that's exactly why me and Alex
1:20
are starting to move into the electric discs because we believe we will have much more greater power meaning it'll
1:26
take off much quicker you won't have about ultrasonic generator but I mean I also
1:33
want to see magic so why not let's let's see how that
1:40
goes graian name I mean it's cool and it represents
1:48
the model it's great and plus in in the background we're also working on the
1:53
granov platform we are excluding the control mechanism to make it simple
1:59
because right now with just looking for lift off have most of the body parts the
2:05
simple parts we just need what we need we we just need some time from this
2:11
gravelot to put the pieces together attach it to um high voltage generator
2:18
and watch it take off see the results because of modern technology we can actually get a much more better results
2:43
since we're waiting on the grav to take off I
2:48
already okay that's good let's see m
3:01
okay we're starting
3:23
up yeah this box is a high voltage high voltage generator
3:56
is okay him he's saying that for now he just plugged in he's getting the
4:02
electricity from the plug in the house and he's using this generator to distribute the
4:09
energy all
4:15
right CER famous
4:28
One
4:38
CER ultrasonic
4:50
generator okay this is the main box that he's using to just control manipulate
4:56
the ultra frequency but it would be much better if he had a screen where we can actually see the
5:05
numbers Alex
5:59
St [Music]
6:12
Alex is explaining that this box is directly linked to Distributing and
6:17
changing their ultrasonic frequency but despite his efforts he has not managed
6:23
to find any any regulator with a screen that will actually show the correct frequency
6:30
so right now he has a scale from 1 to three 1 to three and by making small
6:35
tiny nudges he changes frequen yeah he makes big changes in the frequency
7:02
okay this this one directly shows the voltage on the electric motors
7:36
[Music] for
8:15
from that Tiny Box there's two buttons one on the top one is distributes the
8:20
electrical energy into the electric motors and the Low Bottom one activates
8:26
the ultasonic generator in that one thck cable the big white one it has four
8:32
cables inside two of them go into the electric motor and the two of them also go directly into the ultronic generator
8:40
now for the central disc
9:02
so this the the thin wire that goes on the central
9:22
dis yeah so The Catcher And The Thin wire goes directly on dis sorry it
9:29
connected to the Tesla coil just put in is there anything at the end of that wire like a weight uh you mean when it
9:36
comes out from the from the Tesla coil yeah how's it connected to the Tesla
10:09
he's saying that if you have long wires long cables means like if you gravel at
10:14
like 50 m away you need to put this thin cable deep deep inside to have as much of the energy going into this wire but
10:22
if it's close like proximity 2 3 m you can just be slightly in
10:42
uhhuh okay he's showing us how deep it's
10:53
inside not do not okay he's saying it's the length of his arm so it's like what
10:59
50 yeah I think it's like 50 centimeters deep inside but the the longer it is the
11:05
more you have to put inside just to get more more power out of
11:17
it how long is the wi uh
11:32
it's about two three meters in
11:45
[Music]
11:58
total yep
12:05
he's explaining on long distances where
12:25
he that little pointy Edge he just showed that is the direct link to this
12:34
Tesla coil he he connects the thin wire directly to this this uh what do you
12:40
call this edge of the Tesla coil when the distance is big and long but when
12:45
it's a short distance like right now he just inserts the cable the thing cable directly inside the Tesla
13:15
want to put everything in frame [Music]
13:35
put everything in the
13:46
screen Jared what's up it's uh what time is that your place you look gloomy
14:02
yeah yeah it's good you can see it
14:28
yeah for
15:12
maybe just down a little bit so we can see his hands you need to be able
15:20
to and the grav aier
15:26
too well this is going to be a long video so let's let's make it comfortable for
15:41
us it's going to bring it a little bit closer stick in the frame
15:59
ohe
16:31
how's it should we put it closer a little little closer can't
16:37
quite see the top rotor
17:27
CIA for
18:14
okay okay so he's explaining that he hasn't yet tested it he made sure he checked up all the instruments the boxes
18:21
mostly and they're all were in working order but since he hasn't yet measured
18:26
the energy density of this gravelot he hasn't yet tested it he doesn't even know if it's going to take off so no
18:33
promises but we're here for the unexpected we're here to see if that's possible so it might take about about an
18:39
hour so [Music]
18:57
[Music]
19:10
okay we first activated the the motors so the discs should be
19:15
rotated
19:23
now just a moment okay it's starting up
19:30
so he's explaining first the first step is to activate this tourist field this
19:36
what I call so set up the right energy in order
19:41
for us to make this tourus fi and that is done specifically through rotation
19:47
these discs
20:04
he's going to connect the speaker so he can hear
20:13
us I'm trying to count the
20:24
magnets no this the old design the Tesla call the the electrics
20:30
will not need the ultra there will be much there will be
20:36
only two discs and they'll be much much closer so in that case I think the only
20:42
thing we're going to have to worry about is to make the discs without breaking them as
20:50
only no Alex is right now trying to connect the
20:56
speakers so so he can hear us boom box so he can hear us because he's on the
21:01
computer right
21:23
now okay so he's explaining that Taurus fields
21:29
uh form anytime and anywhere when something
21:34
rotates around something when you have when you have a rotating disc a t field
21:40
appears it it forms but but it's very weak so in order to boost it we use also
21:48
an electromagnetic disc we we also have a rotating electromagnetic dis
21:56
sure what that
22:18
so he he's explained that even a car with rotating Wheels also contributes in
22:24
creating theour Fields but they're very very weak and they're almost are not B in order to increase the potential
22:30
energy we also link up an electromagnetic dis to boost up the
22:56
energy so
23:09
so one dis these both discs they rotate like into each other which means they
23:16
both rotate opposite ways yeah yeah yeah what so the lower disc
23:24
rotating counterclockwise top disc rotating clock
23:37
no VI done we can see VI
24:06
uhuh now when the discs are standing there's no to T field obviously forming but when they're rotating that's when we
24:14
get the energy
24:27
pumping for
25:07
uhuh so he's saying that uhuh he's saying that we activate
25:15
the electric motors the motors can be are rotation on specific
25:21
RPM and in order to increase the energy density of the tourist fields we
25:26
slightly increase their electrical energy that we distribute
25:31
into the discs so he's right now in slowly increasing with the box that's on
25:37
the left the big box on the left he's slowly increasing the energy that he's inserting into the
25:44
discs that are rotating the one with magnets and one without magnets both of
25:50
them
26:13
okay so now that the discs are rotating the energy is pumped up into the discs both of the discs the taus field is
26:20
slowly starting to form
26:35
understand right now he's explaining later on when we get used to it the setup that's when we going to start
26:42
stepping into action
27:08
m
27:42
so the bottom little box in the center after after the discs are rotating after
27:50
the energy is distributed in the both rotation discs next step is to activate the Tesla coil the central little box at
27:59
the bottom is the catcher using the catcher he sets how do you say
28:04
it he activates the Tesla coil and starts inserting the electrical
28:11
energy into the central disc because right now the the when the discs are rotating they create the T field slowly
28:18
but surely but they are annihilating each other when they Collide so right
28:25
now it's useless energy for us when he activates the catcher Tesla coil is also
28:31
activated starts inserting its energy into the central stationary dis that's
28:37
when we have a somewhat stable form of tourist field only after that as he
28:44
activate the ultrasonic generator J
28:53
Alex Le say okay good just a
29:03
moment he needs to set up the time when to activate the generator
29:16
ultronic three four minutes after
29:45
yeah okay so after you after the disc start to rotate give
29:52
it like 3 4 minutes to establish a specific RPM that's when you activate
30:00
the the electrical energy that will start that will go into the both both discs that are rotating and you increase
30:07
the power slowly start from a slow voltage going up and up that way the
30:12
energy of the tors field will start will stabiliz the increase Controlled Chaos
30:19
controlled Alex
30:42
so this is a very unnatural physics that we're
30:47
working with here so he's explaining that this energy it appears and disappears very unnaturally uh
30:55
uncontrolled and therefore yeah
31:02
it that's exactly why we have all all the this whole setup in order to control
31:07
it control and form it and stabilize it that's what here to find out Alex
31:35
so we slowly increase the energy that is distributed into this rotation disc to
31:40
slowly make up the tors
31:56
fields for
32:21
[Music]
32:34
okay so after after this are already rotating 3 four minutes that's when you
32:40
activate the electrical energy and in a on a period of 15 minutes you have to
32:45
slowly slowly increase its energy you have to watch the clock and slowly slowly increase the energy on a period
32:51
of 15
32:56
minutes for
33:05
[Music]
33:30
uhhuh okay okay so in order to prevent any glitches any short circuits or
33:39
explosions that's another reason why you have to slowly slowly increase the energy because it's a very primitive device and there's nothing really
33:46
holding this wires to the discs really it's just it's just under a spring so
33:51
you got to slowly slow increase the energy to watch it because that's a high voltage going inside the discs and don't
33:57
want any explosions safety
34:18
reasons after 15 minutes we activate the um the Tesla the catcher the Tesla
34:24
catcher the central disc yeah joh
35:23
m
35:49
uhuh
36:24
okay so this is where the tricky part happens after the 15 minute period we activate
36:32
the catcher the catcher activates the Tesla the Tesla provides the electrical energy into the central disc Central
36:38
stationary disc now with a little knob on the slightly on the left and in the
36:44
cental of this cater we
36:49
regulate the frequency that is distributed into the central dis
36:54
according to the frequency according to the frequencies that are
37:00
created by the both how both torsion fields that are
37:07
created by these both rotation discs so we have two rotation discs one has magnets on it one has Electro
37:14
electromagnetic potential energy on it and they have both have different sort of frequencies they're it's a little bit
37:20
mixed up using this catcher we have to regulate the
37:26
frequency that was stable symbolize both of these resonating no we have to set it up into
37:34
resonance both of these torsion fields that appear on both of the rotating
37:41
discs this is the tricky part because we don't really have any way to measure this tus fields that are forming that's
37:50
why we don't exactly know on where what frequency we should apply to it for it
37:56
to take off because the this the part where it actually takes off when you regulate the cater so this is where
38:03
the minutes and hours are taken into place when you have to sit and regulate the
38:26
frequency for
39:26
en for
40:26
the
40:56
for for
41:56
C for
42:35
Hello Alex
43:26
the fore
43:58
hold up almost
44:26
there for
44:32
[Music]
45:23
m m nor
45:40
m al
45:49
yes okay yeah I I'm just ask to be a little bit quiet
46:05
hello can you hear me I here Alex
46:20
Alex T the most important part here is the
46:26
catcher cater is used to stabilize the tors fields that are forming around the
46:31
the two rotation discs now let's imagine we have these
46:38
two rotation discs they're forming a chaotic two different types of chaotic
46:44
tourist fields in between of them we have the central stationary
46:50
disc when we activate the catcher we sort of activate a
46:57
a layer of electrical energy around the central
47:04
disc now next step is to step into the
47:09
into regulating the amplitude of this Central disc of the of
47:15
the catcher the the knob in the center now the most important part here as he said he doesn't go from from low voltage
47:22
to high voltage from low amplitude to high amplitude he immediately goes up down up down so he's in a
47:29
form he's changing the amplitude drastically making both of these teroid
47:37
fields jump up and down up and down they make it's like it's like a bouncing ball
47:42
I don't know why it it's very childish but it forms my head as uh as energy that's in the C in between these two
47:49
discs the energy between the two discs are starting to
47:55
bounce and jump according to the to the regulation
48:03
that Alex is making with which is literally just twisting the knob left right left right up and down from small
48:10
amplitude to high amplitude now the important part is is to start decreasing
48:17
these amplitudes start making them smaller and smaller because as we know the laws of resonance when you have a
48:24
when you have things how do you say it no I I I just I just
48:30
saw this video as there were different clocks tick tocking left and right at
48:37
different frequencies but eventually they all came to Resonance so same thing is here we are forcing using this
48:45
catcher we are forcing these two tour chaotic tourist fields to stabilize
48:52
under the frequency that we desire which is the this catcher this the this catcher is
49:01
the one that uh stabilizes the T Fields into a specific frequency now once we
49:07
sort of started to decrease the the Turning of the knob decreasing
49:13
the how do you say it the height of our amplitude then we we have to like sense
49:22
it we have to like sense that this gravelot is ready to take off and that's
49:27
when we activate the aonic generator and at that moment it has to pop up like
49:33
take
49:41
[Music] off so the little the little button on
49:48
the top on the center that's the ultrasonic generator so we have to watch when he press the
49:55
thing I [Music]
50:01
so so the right knob is to regulate the Resonance of the ultrasonic generator
50:08
yes
50:50
[Music]
50:56
what say
51:06
the cater and aonic Generator
51:12
[Music]
51:55
C
52:13
[Music] fore
52:19
[Music]
52:25
speee for
52:46
[Music]
53:01
[Music]
53:21
effect
53:38
[Music]
53:50
uhuh uhuh okay wow okay uh for
54:22
[Music]
54:52
[Music] okay in order for us to
54:58
stabilize the taus the both tus fields that are forming around the rotation discs we also need to add in the
55:05
autosonic generator this is where we add in
55:10
so while we are regulating the catcher
55:15
the knob in the center we tur it left and right we activate the ultrasonic generator which is the little button on
55:21
the top and with the knob on the right and the knob at the the bottom of the
55:26
catcher we have to regulate them both together at the same time this this
55:32
is the complicated part this the interesting part they both need to
55:39
work together in resonance in order to stabilize the tourist fields that are
55:46
creation around these discs now when so you basically have to
55:53
turn them both at the same time uh they catcher you turn it left and right high
55:59
and lower amplitude the ultrasonic generator you slowly you you don't treat
56:05
it the same way you slowly increase the amplitude of the ultrasonic generator slowly
56:11
when the gravelot is about to take off there you should feel like a nudge as he
56:19
explains you should feel like the catcher is given off the catcher I don't
56:24
get the catcher or the ultrasonic generat they they should like give off a a
56:29
humming sound um yeah like something stuck in the engine a little slightly
56:35
deep humming sound that's when you have to turn off the ult Sonic generator uh
56:44
five times you but on um on a increasing amplitude meaning you you you don't
56:50
touch the knobs anymore you turn off the ultronic generator in 3 seconds you turn
56:55
about on on uh then you turn it off in two seconds you turn it back on turn it off
57:02
then uh on the third step you turn it uh the four and five you turn it on and off on and
57:09
off and that's when it should actually take take off
57:55
for fore
58:31
so the way this ult Sonic generator works when you press
58:37
it Alex [Music]
58:56
okay that's that's to turn on the
59:04
generator has to turn off and on the element okay okay so the bottom on the
59:11
left is to turn on the ultrasonic generator but
59:25
it for
1:00:07
[Music] it's turned off [Music]
1:00:34
[Music]
1:00:55
okay okay okay let's go a little bit back we have
1:01:00
the cat at the bottom we have the ultasonic generator at the top we need to regulate both knobs at the same
1:01:08
time now the but on the ultronic generator as we can see on the button on the left is to turn it on so the button
1:01:16
in the center is to it's it's it's very it's to turn it
1:01:22
on and off yeah it's to turn it on and off the knob on the right is to regulate
1:01:28
the the P element the ultrasonic generator so what he's
1:01:34
saying we need to what call regulate
1:01:39
using the knob on the right we have to regulate a certain frequency that we
1:01:44
need for our grael LOD this is the complicated part because we don't know which frequency and we somehow have to
1:01:52
collaborate it with the with with the resonance that we're creating with the
1:01:59
catcher so at the same time turning the turning on and off the catcher no increasing decreasing amplitude but but
1:02:06
very important when we catch I this is magical part I don't know how we catch
1:02:11
it when we catch that ultrasonic frequency that we want that's
1:02:18
when we start to make the piece of
1:02:23
elements how do you say it also it it also has to um create an frequency a a
1:02:33
jumping wave a jumping wave in energy on the P of element just like the on the
1:02:38
catcher that's where we use this little button because right now when it's up
1:02:44
it's on when you press it it turns off so when you catch that frequency we
1:02:49
don't want to we don't touch it we don't want to change it we leave it we don't
1:02:55
we do not touch the cut it also we remove our hands from that we only start pressing the button on the ultrasonic
1:03:02
generator one is you press it once to turn it off you you let let go
1:03:10
immediately and that creates an amplitude a jumping wave on our P
1:03:15
element on our aonic generator after 3 seconds you press it again let go after
1:03:22
two seconds you press it again let go so we're like pressing pressing pressing to get is jumping wave on on the P element
1:03:29
in order to create a resonance between the catcher ultrasonic generator and th
1:03:36
thus we are forcing these both tourist fields to stabilize under
1:03:42
the um jumping bouncing energy waves
1:03:47
from The Catcher And the alic generator wow I'm a scientist yeah so uh so
1:03:53
somewhat we have to say that we have a a three l layer condensator our three layer
1:04:00
condensator we we we create a fake tus field with the rotating discs make ampl
1:04:08
jumping amplitude waves using the ultrasonic generator and the catcher
1:04:13
thus we stabilize the tus fields and the gravity
1:04:20
basically wraps around the gravelot allowing it to propel up for
1:04:26
up if most important part this is the most important part if nothing if we failed we after the pressing the of the
1:04:34
button of the aonic generator about five times and it did not take off if it
1:04:39
failed or you know tilted sideways and did not take off we basically turn off everything the catcher aonic generator
1:04:46
and the uh what do you call this electrical energy that is implied onto the discs
1:04:53
and we also turn up the discs because we want because as he explained we created a wrong frequency we created a wrong
1:05:00
amplitude for the tour field so we want the tour fields to dissipate we want
1:05:06
them to annihilate each other and disappear for that we turn up all the
1:05:12
machines everything and we wait about 10 15 minutes to like you know cool off
1:05:18
cool everything down that's when we get back to it step by step turning everyone
1:05:24
back on we go back to regulating because we don't really have any
1:05:30
panels of telling us exactly what frequency we are getting what what
1:05:36
frequency we need we can't really establish the right one it's all on a guess of when we feel like the knob is
1:05:42
good let's go let's press that ultrasonic generator let's see if it's going to take off now but I think
1:05:47
actually it would be much wiser if the next step would actually would be to attach some panels some dashboard to
1:05:55
actually show us the frequency that we use that we can roughly know which ones we will need and roughly between the
1:06:02
hundreds up to 10 the millerz okay so yeah okay so we roughly went
1:06:09
through everything we will attempt to set it up start it up and let's see how
1:06:15
that goes Alexa yeah
1:06:27
uh okay gentlemen do we need like a five minute break or we can just jump into starting off all right
1:06:33
[Music]
1:06:46
[Music]
1:06:54
cool for
1:07:15
[Music]
1:07:21
[Music]
1:07:38
[Music] yeah I'm asking to move the the
1:07:45
[Music] machine yeah yeah it's better it's good
1:07:52
har har All right sorry
1:08:11
enough starting off the electric motors
1:08:26
12 vol
1:08:40
[Laughter]
1:08:56
okay we wait three four minutes for the for the energy to build up and the tors
1:09:02
you know start puming
1:09:14
[Laughter]
1:09:28
now we're forming the SKS 3 four minutes 3 four minutes
1:09:45
[Laughter]
1:10:16
we're activating the High Vol frequency generator that is inserting the electric energy onto the disc
1:10:30
of 15 minutes we are slowly increasing the electric energy that inserted into
1:10:35
the discs increase increase the potential
1:10:52
energy so right now be we are we are inserting this electrical energy into
1:10:58
the discs in order to allow this tourist fields to slowly build up their like you
1:11:07
know power bank they so as as we might
1:11:12
say when we just started up discs we had a energy level of 1% but by increasing
1:11:19
by slowly increasing the electrical energy onto the discs we're slowly you know going temp % 20% up to 100% of
1:11:28
power onto this tourist fields that we're creating so right now we're wasting
1:11:35
about 10 15 minutes for the tourist fields to start pumping up their
1:11:52
energy oh I just yeah Alexa used to have a device that
1:11:58
allows to measure this tourist fields and their energy
1:12:04
level he's going to have to yeah he's going to have to make it we're going to need that
1:12:09
stuff now
1:12:18
what 0.55 ampers
1:12:29
[Music]
1:12:34
yeah yeah he's explaining he uses this regulator for electric motors so
1:12:42
that so that to control the rotation of the
1:12:47
motors that's that that's in the case when it's when it's indoors when he's using the socket when he's using the
1:12:55
how do you say it the car battery yeah that's one especially use
1:13:10
for SL increasing energy
1:13:43
so he's saying that tors Fields naturally don't occur quickly otherwise
1:13:49
because to fields are high density of energy they don't form quickly you have
1:13:54
to slow slow but surely pump in the energy and slowly increase it until you actually it's actually formed so you can
1:14:00
start playing around with it and stabilize
1:14:09
it at full speed come again is the motors at full
1:14:15
speed
1:14:38
okay so he says right now they're working at Max but I think it would be better to check up the parameters of the
1:14:44
motor I think that way we can actually determine what maximum speed they can actually
1:14:52
go actually reminds me I try to attach a disc with magnets onto a grinder because
1:15:00
a grinder has 11,000 RPM and that really went bad because I
1:15:05
basically attached 5kg to a small grinder and I almost got my face blown
1:15:10
off so that was
1:15:22
fun so right now we just
1:15:30
we don't press anything
1:15:55
if there while we wait there's any questions let them out
1:16:00
let's let's hear them s ask away yeah we sent you a list of
1:16:07
questions Mel do you have that um L first wanted ask about his training
1:16:13
esoteric training hold up let me open that list
1:16:19
his uh what was the nature and content of his training and including what
1:16:24
involved feeling like T Energy development tuition what skills did he
1:16:53
acquire for
1:17:42
of human being [Music]
1:18:03
[Music]
1:18:09
okay so so he basically he basically did some courses
1:18:15
on on sensing the biological energy field in
1:18:47
so so he's explained one of this one of his uh
1:18:52
tests one of his lessons were you rub your hands together very very
1:18:58
tight and then uh after after a short period of time you actually you you put
1:19:03
your hands together and you have to like feel like some hot air in in between your palms like
1:19:18
forming TR right now
1:19:28
[Music]
1:19:40
yeah so so he's saying like be because of the rubbing of the hands we're sort
1:19:46
of creating a somewhat dense energy field around our
1:19:53
hand palms and it's allows us to slightly feel the movement of the Wind
1:20:00
from one Palm to the other like in between our palms we slightly feel the wind but it very quickly dissipates so
1:20:07
you have to like be quick and sense it
1:20:21
he all right so he's like if you you keep doing it at first you don't actually sense it but you keep on doing
1:20:27
it at a period of month you actually get the get the hang of actually sensing of
1:20:32
actually forming this dense energy around your hands and actually sensing it
1:21:04
Al
1:21:51
[Music]
1:22:23
okay
1:22:40
[Music]
1:22:53
for for
1:23:09
[Music]
1:23:24
you all right let's get back to explaining so the where do we
1:23:32
start the tors fields
1:23:47
[Music]
1:23:58
so fields that are created around these this gravelot are natural God
1:24:07
created or universe created they're Natural Healthy energy fields and they're the
1:24:14
same type of energy fields that are around the human body so the courses that he took was specifically to sense
1:24:22
the energies around the human body and how to actually develop their sense to
1:24:28
actually create these dense energy Fields by rubbing hands together and
1:24:36
trying to sense the the waves between them but you have to thr on a period of month to actually be able to sense it
1:24:41
and thus it this actually allowed him to also feel the tourus fields that are forming
1:24:47
he can even sometimes feel in which direction the tourist fields are
1:24:53
rotating but yeah yeah yeah so when for for example
1:24:59
in the course that he took you rub your hands together the dense Energy Fuels accumulates and that actually allows you
1:25:05
to dissipate any negative energy in for example in in a human in a human in a
1:25:12
human brain so you have to just apply apply your palms on onto your face and all your negative energy is gone makes
1:25:20
you more healthy but essentially this would be a good discipline to develop in
1:25:26
order to start also sensing these T Fields like sa because that could be
1:25:32
actually very useful
1:26:04
[Music]
1:26:15
ah okay yeah yeah so he's saying the the C is right now activated and the light bulb shows us that it's activated
1:26:30
yeah okay see so that light bulb
1:26:36
actually lights up lights up
1:27:12
right now the cat is activated and we're attempting to form the cocon around the
1:27:18
two chaotic fields
1:27:36
after you activate the CER you to wait before you actually start regulating
1:27:47
it ah 3 four minutes maximum 5 minutes five minutes
1:28:05
how does temperature variation affect the tuning such as the rotor
1:28:13
spacing um the temperature specifically on
1:28:20
the what the temperature in the environment does cold air or hot air in
1:28:27
the air around you change the spacing or the ultrasound frequency that makes it
1:28:38
left uh wait wait one more time you mean the spacing between the tors Fields no
1:28:44
no no this the rotors they they can be kind of in different close or far away
1:28:51
midle so right now he's activating the AIC
1:28:57
generator lights on he hasn't yet moved to tuning the catcher yet right now
1:29:02
we're tuning the cater and old
1:29:21
Generator only way and he's watching he's watching the ra lot to have like a nudge
1:29:42
movement so right now he's trying to regulate trying to find the right
1:29:47
frequency
1:29:54
m
1:30:41
m
1:31:07
m
1:31:29
you
1:32:21
the moment of resonance and his trying to capture that humming sound the cut
1:32:28
but it's very quiet that's why it's very hard to hear it
1:32:54
m
1:33:49
um
1:34:18
m
1:35:22
m for
1:36:06
fore spee [Laughter]
1:36:34
he's saying that he could really use the gravitometer to check up the T
1:36:40
Fields right now he's just in the Black Ocean but it'll turn blue very soon
1:37:36
m
1:37:57
h
1:38:47
I know where you're talking about I am loving this so many hours doing the same
1:38:57
thing this now we got a real inventor showing us how to good the job done
1:39:52
sure USR
1:40:00
says this is the process that takes a lot of patience you
1:40:06
know go grab some coffee
1:40:11
wow I would love to beat there right now
1:40:53
m
1:41:36
spe [Music]
1:42:01
hello can you hear me okay yeah
1:42:07
Alex Alex uh was saying he actually caught the humming of the catcher he's
1:42:13
asking we can actually hear it
1:42:41
so it and now he's trying to find that that humming
1:42:52
moment e
1:43:39
[Music]
1:43:49
so he said he caught it again lost it again
1:43:54
get the perfect
1:44:08
moment so he's sweeping through the frequencies with The Catcher And slowly
1:44:15
changing the ultra sound as he does it right
1:44:27
yes I'm here can you hear me yeah did did you hear my question is that correct
1:44:32
for what he's doing is he sweeping back and forth with The Catcher And slowly
1:44:39
changing the ultrasound as he goes back and forth absolutely
1:44:45
yes that's good
1:44:54
oh
1:45:50
again so we try to catch the huming and quickly press the button
1:46:29
so now that is ultasonic generator he has turned the knob to the max he's right now going the
1:46:35
opposite way decreasing it and again swinging the catch your left right left
1:46:40
right trying to catch that humming moment
1:47:19
like you need to at least be five minutes quiet so that he can actually hear so don't interrupt him
1:48:00
so he's saying he's he's pressing the buttons right now watch some
1:48:10
generator okay he did not catch that moment turn off
1:48:34
now since it hasn't taken off yet we need to at least minutes start again so
1:48:41
he said he the humming sound he just needs to press the ultrasonic generator button
1:48:49
to switch off on and then switch back on
1:48:55
[Music]
1:49:06
[Music]
1:49:21
for
1:49:29
[Music]
1:49:51
for for
1:50:01
[Music]
1:50:19
[Music]
1:50:27
[Music]
1:50:38
so first he rubs his hands quickly and then he slowly inre distance between his
1:50:46
palms and you're sort of supposed to feel the like a wavy form of energy
1:50:52
we be form
1:50:59
of we open up feel that that energy our hands
1:51:29
okay well this sounds funny yeah but basically you open up your PS in a sense so that
1:51:34
are filled up with energy you slowly uh the person above his
1:51:42
head this the process of releasing negative energy from a person's head
1:51:47
from his brains I think calling brains is be correct way from his from his
1:51:53
basically negative energy from his head so we approach the person right above his head
1:51:59
withs then we slowly hands and toss them to the side
1:52:05
like we're thrown away TR we lift up the negative energy with our magical hand toss away the negative toss way to the
1:52:11
side as thr away negative energy I think after couple of weeks or maybe a month
1:52:17
of practice I believe we are GNA actually finally feel it that difference
1:52:23
releasing negative energy and and this actually he send
1:52:30
this Horus field around the gravelot [Music]
1:52:48
yes I'm using using a headset
1:52:53
at a distance but I'm right now I'm literally cim from the mhone is it
1:52:58
better now
1:53:10
SL how's it now to recharging D we're starting again
1:53:22
discs rotating three four minutes for
1:53:31
the discs to anticipate their energy to field
1:53:57
I don't know if you heard the question but Jared had asked if how does the temperature
1:54:03
variation yes about that yeah let's go back to that y so how does the temperature in
1:54:10
the air affect the space between wait if I understand correctly you you
1:54:18
want to determine at what distance must the must the diss be dependent on the
1:54:24
temperature that's created between them between the temperature that's created from Winter is listen winter is cold
1:54:33
summer is hot yes the discs have a set spacing but in the one that he gave
1:54:40
Charles and the one that he gave Russell the spacing was a little bit different
1:54:45
between those two and so I'm wondering if whether building one in the winter
1:54:52
and doing it in the winter where it's cold or building it and doing it all in the Summer where it's
1:54:58
warm might affect the spacing that's true what
1:55:06
Alex what
1:55:37
right now we turn on the generator uhuh
1:55:52
so right now turn on the generator and he on a period of 10 15 minutes he's going to slowly increase the electrical
1:55:58
energy that's inserted into the rotation discs
1:56:16
now okay so he explained that there was Winter there was cold you actually have
1:56:23
to put the discs closer uh there words hot summer plus
1:56:31
plus a big plus like in Africa that's where you have to actually put the discs at a distance um but again it's all it's
1:56:38
all up to the testing to determine out What distance must be but first we need to establish what the the
1:56:45
specific numbers of frequency that we need to use for our generator and catcher a Sonic generator
1:56:54
all right so there's a a second part to that question so the spacing changes that's awesome to know the frequency of
1:57:02
the ultrasound does it tend to be lower in the winter or higher in the winter
1:57:08
than it is in the summer
1:57:41
we're slowly increasing the energy on the on the rotating dis all right jaral uh apologies I didn't actually hear that
1:57:48
yes where there where it's winter we have to actually manually I believe decrease the the distance between the
1:57:54
disc where's summer uh where's the actually I think we should like
1:58:00
establish some kind of well on the bigger versions on the actual actual vehicles I think we're going to have to
1:58:07
establish some kind of some kind of piston some kind of yeah kind of piston that actually
1:58:13
manually calibrate the distance I am I'm currently working on building a A system
1:58:19
that lets you adjust the spacing with a a little switch um but the other half of
1:58:26
my question was the frequency of the ultrasound in the winter versus Summer
1:58:31
is The Sweet Spot the good spot for the ultrasound usually lower in the winter
1:58:38
and higher in the summer or is it usually higher in the winter and lower in the
1:58:43
summer does the ultrasound frequency on the depending on the
1:58:50
weather region
1:59:19
Alex yeah okay so yes yes he said that there where it's winter usually you
1:59:25
don't need such a high frequency like a low one would be just good enough but where it's summer you need like a much
1:59:31
much bigger frequency I think it probably has to do with the fact that in summer you have to actually put the
1:59:37
distance between the gravelot discs at a distance therefore you need like more energy higher amplitude so yeah you do
1:59:44
need a higher frequency on the ult Sonic generator yes
1:59:52
amen amen okay everyone everyone is taking their time I'm going to go make myself coffee yes Alex say what's
1:59:59
up Rel we're increasing the energy coffee time
2:00:37
that's look back me know
2:01:18
St uhhuh so he's explaining that the most
2:01:24
difficult part everyone can hear me correctly yeah Okay cool so he's explaining the most difficult part in
2:01:31
the in this whole process is actually to catch that humming moment of the catcher
2:01:37
and proceed quickly and to start to turn on and off the ultrasonic generator so
2:01:44
again when you press it it turns off when you let go it's on and you and by
2:01:49
pressing on and off you are you making this jumping wave on the P element this
2:01:56
electronic generator that's what we want so again it's all patience but I
2:02:03
swear it would be much more quicker much more easier if we had some panels showing us the right frequencies that
2:02:09
we're using on each device got to make it more sophisticated but it's good it's good on
2:02:18
that note if the frequency gener Ator if
2:02:23
Alexi doesn't like that we can get him another device that is just a little
2:02:30
handheld thing about this big and he just puts a probe just a one
2:02:39
of you mean it's it's something like a laser shoting to deter RPM yeah yeah he just puts the probe
2:02:47
right next to the ultrasound wire and and this will tell him what
2:02:52
frequency that's at oh wait wait you you mean you have to apply it Direct close
2:02:58
to the P element or just to the generator the the wire on on the
2:03:05
controller box there where he's turning the knob you just take this and you just like set it you can just set it like
2:03:11
that even um wow or or you can just put it directly on clip it on or clip it on
2:03:19
to the I get you I get you yeah that's pretty that's pretty handy and and then you see exactly what frequencies and he
2:03:27
will see the catcher frequency the high voltage frequency and the ultrasound
2:03:34
frequency but the best thing would be to leave the ultrasound once he gets it all flying to turn everything off and then
2:03:42
um turn without touching the ultrasound turn it back on and turn on just the ultrasound and see what frequency he had
2:03:48
the ultrasound at when it was flying and don't have anything else turned on that's do you want to catch
2:03:55
that one glorious moment because then we only have to regulate the CER I I have uh a table I have a a a
2:04:06
spreadsheet right now that um I think if we can find the ultrasound
2:04:12
frequency that it flies at my table will tell us everything else you need to know
2:04:18
it will tell you what frequency you need the catcher at what frequency you need
2:04:23
the high voltage at what speed you need the discs at what spacing you need the discs at but I need that one stupid
2:04:31
number of the frequency you can totally get if you actually send that device and
2:04:37
look bro he already set up this whole machine he just needs that one device how much do you think it will cost to actually send him as as delivery to
2:04:45
him $200 less than $200 we can get it over to him in like two or three get
2:04:52
those magical numbers which will save us all the trouble yes wow that's that's a big deal all right so he's explain that
2:04:58
he slow again he increased the energy on the on
2:05:04
the high voltage generator wow how do you prevent the
2:05:10
high volt from sparking if you go too high it'll spark right now that's true
2:05:16
that's true that that's what that's exactly why as he mentioned you start from small to up but you mean like how they're connect to prevent this sparking
2:05:24
how does he know where to stop at the maximum cuz if you keep going it'll
2:05:30
eventually spark I don't think there's any numbers that will determine let me ask
2:06:14
okay okay
2:06:19
so okay so he said he already put a limiter on this uh electrical gener generator and
2:06:28
he already put a limiter on how much actually how far it goes so the knob can turn it can turn but the limit prevents
2:06:35
it from going way too high because we don't want to see any false magic happening
2:06:54
what's the limiter is it just a mark did he just mark on the where
2:07:19
maximum uhuh uhhuh
2:07:27
[Music]
2:07:37
Max maximum
2:08:12
all right so he says there's a transistor that actually converts the 12 volts into a 15 to 16
2:08:20
Kilts and yes essentially there is a limiter that that he what's up bro that
2:08:27
he actually activated inside this
2:08:53
ah 16 16 Kilts yeah so he said the maximum is 16 Kilts that goes onto the
2:09:06
disc right so he said you can actually go higher but that's not necessary for safety reasons but you can go higher if
2:09:12
you want if you're ready to see Sparks you see where the red and black
2:09:18
wires are crossing um if it's 16 Kilts I think it would short between the two that high
2:09:25
voltage so how does he prevent the high voltage from shorting the
2:09:31
wires know are these black and red cables come from the same box yes so
2:09:37
wait wait the question the question again you're asking why is there no short circuit when when they're Crossing
2:09:43
they're not Crossing yeah the red and the black near the gravier yeah that's a high voltage GC if it's high voltage
2:09:49
it'll short through the insulation start Alex
2:10:59
ah wow okay so that's okay so the way he explains these are some very special cables that
2:11:05
actually manage to hold up to 6 Kilts of electrical
2:11:12
energy but for some reason when they're together when they're in two separate wires not in one cable but in two
2:11:18
separate wires they manage to withstand 16 KT so he been testing with 16 Kilts
2:11:23
two separate wires just Loosely hanging and he hasn't had any issues yet but he
2:11:30
yeah yeah so these wires they will stand 6 six kils
2:11:44
each 15es pass let's get to we turn on the catcher
2:11:56
so we're starting to increase and decrease amplitude on the CER
2:12:38
okay so right now he turned on the catcher he's playing around left and right increase decrease in amplitude on
2:12:43
a period of roughly three four maximum five minutes before turning on the pis
2:12:50
Electric generator
2:13:27
Alex
2:14:15
just just he doesn't have any more videos bro sadly he puts them all directly from
2:14:22
onto onto YouTube it doesn't actually put it through Google Drive so that one video got a take care of it it's
2:14:31
gold we got to make new diamonds right here yeah we're hoping to get higher definition videos so if he could just
2:14:38
upload what he has on his Google Drive more storage how much does a GoPro cost we
2:14:44
could actually send that thing to him yeah how much would it cost use the iPhone that iPhone has an
2:14:52
amazing camera set the iPhone up a little ways away so you can see his tuning and you can see the the whole
2:14:58
thing and just hit record have it plugged in have it plugged into the wall because the battery will die but hit
2:15:05
record and if it takes four hours it doesn't matter upload that to will be made amen
2:15:14
okay yeah I'll tell him that I'll tell them to get something like something that will hold the phone in place and to
2:15:20
check up that everything is in frame that's a good idea it's better than
2:15:36
computer all right we're almost about to activate the aonic
2:15:44
generator we're going to call it USG ultronic generator with smart scientist USG
2:16:12
up he said for us to be quiet he's right we're he's right
2:16:19
now e
2:17:49
for
2:18:19
e
2:18:49
for
2:19:19
e
2:19:49
for for
2:20:41
fore
2:20:58
so he's saying that you need at least a few seconds of humming before you actually activate the start pressing the
2:21:03
button of the Onan
2:21:19
generator
2:21:49
for
2:22:19
for
2:22:49
e
2:23:19
for
2:23:49
e for
2:24:49
for for
2:25:30
for spee spee foreign speech
2:26:16
he pressed it a little bit too late no but he got it he got a good
2:26:49
moment for
2:27:24
so I gave him like a few minutes break to call off CU he must be breaking his knees trying to regulate
2:27:30
it
2:27:37
wow hello jaral I can't hear you sorry I I heard the sound right
2:27:44
before I Al yeah it was weird like deep I I've heard the sound
2:27:50
before um it sounds like the rotors this the spinning disc they start speeding up
2:27:59
when you get everything in resonance what'll happen is um the eddy current in
2:28:05
the center disc when you're changing the vibration with the ultrasound and the test the
2:28:13
catcher frequency those two things affect that eddy current that the bottom disc is making in the middle disc
2:28:20
and when you change that Edie current just right combined with the right vibration on the top disc uh that top
2:28:28
disc will start to speed up and the bottom one stays the same the bottom one
2:28:33
doesn't change a whole lot um but but the top one it's like you're taking top
2:28:39
one has like Electro the top one has like the most electromagnetic frequency inside it yeah it makes sense yeah so
2:28:47
it's kind of like um it's kind of like riding a bicycle and you're holding the brakes the whole time and then it's like
2:28:53
you're slowly letting off the break and the thing can actually start going to its true
2:29:01
speed uh the way Alex is explaining is that when you catch that moment it's
2:29:08
like the weight well when you stabilize both of
2:29:13
the theal fields the anything that's in between
2:29:18
the stal fields is like has a very small Gap but anything that's in between the to the field especially the central disc
2:29:25
it becomes like nullified to gravity like weightless maybe maybe that has some
2:29:32
kind of effect on the disc as well all right let's go number three can
2:29:40
do this when Alexi comes back to me please
2:29:45
ask him if I could ship him my grav aier kit when I built so we're testing on the
2:29:51
same Hardware you mean uh wait wait come again you mean the same Hardware or the
2:29:57
same craft I want to get build the same two of the same gravl kits and ship him one
2:30:03
so I'm testing on the same Hardware he is oh Al okay so you have two and you
2:30:12
want to give him one that's okay but did you make it or did he make it I made it a copy of his sign
2:30:21
all right that sounds pretty good yeah sure we can do that I think for now let's take take things step by step and
2:30:28
attempt to take get this thing off the ground and actually I
2:30:33
think we need to make this somehow a little bit more professional I think we actually start adding more uh more
2:30:39
gadgets that will allow her to determine what frequency he's playing with that would actually help him a lot uh Jared
2:30:45
that device that you showed me it has only one attachment
2:30:50
which is for the ultrasonic generator can we use it as well for the
2:30:57
ccher so what you do is you just take the probe and you put the Probe
2:31:04
on you don't touch the knobs once once it's flying and it's up in the air you
2:31:09
don't touch any knobs and you just turn the the power switch off right and turn
2:31:15
all all the switches off on everything but you don't touch the knobs okay yes and then and then you turn the power
2:31:21
switch on you just turn on like the ultrasound and then you put the Probe on the ultrasound wire and you turn it off
2:31:28
then you turn on The Catcher And and you measure the catcher and then you turn it off right and since you haven't changed
2:31:34
anything we catch that that frequency at that moment you you'll see what
2:31:39
frequency they were set at when it took off okay so we don't really need it while we are attempting to take off we
2:31:46
only we only needed we only do we only test the frequency after you know after
2:31:52
we catch the moment yeah but that how does that exactly help we need we need be in front
2:31:58
of his eyes so we okay because here's here's how it helps if we know exactly
2:32:04
what frequency it happens at and he does it a couple of times and he writes down
2:32:09
the numbers and he sees okay I got it to fly once when the ultrasound was at 40 khz
2:32:17
and I got it to fly again and hour later with the ultrasound at 60 ktz that gives
2:32:24
us a window if he does it again and does it at 40 kilohertz again that window
2:32:31
goes and and now we know okay these are very specific freen yes and and and so
2:32:38
by him doing it and seeing what numbers it happens at then we can start building our equipment to be better tuned to
2:32:46
those frequencies because right now it's all guess and check but if we know exactly what frequency it's supposed to
2:32:52
work at we get discs that are just a couple millimeters bigger or smaller we get the spacing just you know half a
2:32:59
millimeter more or less right you just you can go and start really fine-tuning it so that it's a lot faster to tune and
2:33:06
it it performs a lot better what about when he's actually
2:33:12
starting up the the flight when he's in the tuning process how EX what he
2:33:20
determine what frequency he running around at because he's he's turning the
2:33:25
knobs left and right he's jumping from zero to 100% yeah yeah yeah that's because right now he's using equipment
2:33:32
that has no displays on it right so if we know what frequency he needs to work
2:33:38
at we get him the equipment that he puts the numbers in with the buttons oh
2:33:44
that's cheating yeah yes it's cheating I'm trying to cheat
2:33:52
oh no but I get it I get it because doing this doing this is fine to to you
2:33:58
know figure out hey this this actually works but you need to go from this to
2:34:04
this to impressing yes I agree make it
2:34:09
go yes all right all
2:34:15
right man but I I really want to see sorry come taking all this time to build up these
2:34:22
fields is very inefficient if there's a way to improve that efficiency and bring
2:34:28
it down from one hour to 10 minutes I like that right's a way you
2:34:36
take an atomic bomb you explode it and then you have some dense electr
2:34:41
potential energy in that zone and then your gravelot can take off within a few
2:34:46
minutes it it's trust me it's electric potentially charge it'll work if you your hands on one of those
2:34:55
oh boy true but I would not want to be anywhere near it and and assuming that
2:35:00
the ground Fier doesn't get blown up amen God be praised but some some of the
2:35:07
math that I have been doing yesterday and today has shown that the amount of
2:35:12
energy stored in this thing is crazy it's storing a ton of energy and in
2:35:21
order to make it in order to make it lift it's only using a little bit of the
2:35:26
energy that's stored in it so if we can fine-tune it we can use a lot more of
2:35:32
that stored energy more and he will actually be able to start lifts him tons now here's a question how do you how did
2:35:38
you determine that he can that he he stores so much energy it all comes down
2:35:44
to the capacitance the amount of charge that you store and how fast you're
2:35:51
charging and discharging that right if you're charging and discharging a capacitor really fast that's a lot of
2:35:58
energy flowing through it per second right so if you if you have even
2:36:04
just a little tiny capacitor but that little tiny capacitor is operating at 10,000 volts of
2:36:13
charge at a million times a second one
2:36:18
megahertz it's a ton of energy like mini
2:36:24
bomb but it's it's all you know very quick it comes and goes comes and goes comes and goes but the graifer takes all
2:36:32
that coming and going and it stores it up and as it stores it up right now it's
2:36:38
only storing a small part of that energy but I think we can fine-tune it and store more of that energy to be able to
2:36:45
use to lift so right now he's lifting one and a half kilograms the amount of
2:36:51
energy that's stored in this thing I think if you were to improve it you could improve that 10 to 100
2:36:58
times that actually explains why you need actually time for the torid fields to actually cool off and dissipate
2:37:05
before actually attempt again part of that might also be because the high voltage on the the discs um aluminum
2:37:14
gets oxygen on it and the oxygen makes a a microscopic rust layer and so when you
2:37:20
put the high voltage on that disc uh the longer it's on there the more that rust
2:37:25
layer will be affected and so it takes a few minutes for that rust layer to kind of get all charged up or or to break off
2:37:32
and get charged
2:37:39
up all right this started up what's the process 3 4 minutes
2:37:51
um Geral the interesting thing about you told me about store storing a large amount of energy actually reminds me of
2:37:58
what this inventor the Russian inventor in Moscow what he told me because his
2:38:03
his craft he made explained to me that it used Atomic form of energy it's like
2:38:11
like a new nuclear power plant in a 60 diameter 60 cm diameter model
2:38:22
uh so yeah yeah it's basically a flying nuclear power plant I explained to him I even showed
2:38:30
pictures and I described everything about our craft and he immediately understood its functions how it works
2:38:35
Etc he's like yes bro this this actually works it's great it's awesome but it has very little potential energy
2:38:43
meaning like compared to his craft our ours is like 0.01%
2:38:49
energy compared to his Atomic level of energy more like in a sense he said that
2:38:55
we take energy from as you said the frequencies charges discharges the
2:39:01
amplitude we take energy from that but he he directly takes energy from how do
2:39:07
you say um from the atom
2:39:13
by how ether no no no no
2:39:20
no yes in a sense the energy comes from The Ether and the energy from The Ether
2:39:26
also charges up from the atoms but the way he gets it is by taking he has three
2:39:32
discs his craft it works on three stages of three discs the C the two the top and bottom
2:39:40
disc they're stationary only the central disc rotate their rotation of these discs very very close to each other I
2:39:46
would have to say like a few maybe like 5 mm apart and be but the most important
2:39:53
part is the compound the structure and the composition of these discs they're made of a special material that sort of
2:40:00
already has energy stored inside it obviously you don't see that it's has energy
2:40:07
stored inside it that when you rotate it's like a magnet and a copper wire when you start moving a a magnet around
2:40:13
the copper wire you you get electrical energy same thing here by cost rotating
2:40:19
these discs very close to each other they're like they fre what's friction yeah somewhat the
2:40:27
friction of these energies allows him to yeah we turn up
2:40:32
the frequency the electrical energy put on the discs are
2:40:45
sure all right so right now we start to build up the energy for the torch field all right back to
2:40:50
it uh by creating the friction between
2:40:55
these two discs obviously the discs don't touch each other but the discs essentially have a very thick layer of
2:41:03
some kind of B bio I think I know the right words bio
2:41:08
energetic field around it that when friction ures between this bio
2:41:15
bioenergetic atomic eeric energy that that's when he is like permitted he
2:41:22
creates an environment where he sucks up energy from The Ether inserts it into
2:41:28
his sticks because the in the inside the discs there's there's a compound and
2:41:34
inside a compound there's these very long sticks about 20 cm long insert it all around inside a disc uh I showed a
2:41:41
picture last time send it again and the energy he's explains that stores inside
2:41:47
these crystals inside these sticks and these sticks dissipate or
2:41:55
more like redirect this energy into the center and out creating this flow of
2:42:03
toroidal etherical energy and this creates a very powerful lift off like
2:42:08
wow he he lost the craft immediately just took off shot off and disappeared ah I want that guy he's
2:42:17
still alive but I need to make that ah this guy is sneaky we need we need to
2:42:23
make the graval take off so we can actually show him some progress and trust me he's going to jump in he'll be
2:42:29
excited and I'll be like well bro give us some information how are the discs made I want
2:42:36
it h no because these discs no he literally he said you just rotate them
2:42:42
he took a drill a power drill and he he used he used the power
2:42:49
drill to manually create a rotation of the central disc that's it he let go the power drill shut off simple it's all
2:42:57
about the compound of discs they're very complex I mean I have the structure of it but even myself I don't think I'll be
2:43:04
able to actually to do it here in Russia
2:43:09
right what what's that white fan on the right Alex's video is it a
2:43:15
heater white f
2:43:21
yeah wait wait come again whitean where on the left on the right right of the
2:43:28
catcher right behind Alexi right now Al
2:44:11
okay I don't know how it's related but he said he has this heater popped up and running because
2:44:18
it's cold in his house that's so he has it running but but I still don't get the question you want to ah yes okay what's
2:44:24
the temperature and and humidity
2:45:03
he's saying that right now it's winter for him so it's actually cold I mean same thing in Africa in Africa if it
2:45:10
goes plus 10 no no you never get plus 10 bro if it goes plus 15 that's it you got
2:45:16
to put close on you look at the sunshine it's not it's not warming anything it's like wow it's cold
2:45:22
season so yeah right
2:45:47
now for parer
2:46:22
Hello
2:46:41
Alex what electric disc nice okay
2:46:55
okay okay so he hasn't tested it yet so we don't know if it will crack but he wants to make another dis before
2:47:03
he tries it
2:47:47
for for [Music]
2:48:23
uh
2:49:13
all right so we discuss right now about electric discs about how we're going to
2:49:19
move on from here so he yes he knows about the positive and the negative
2:49:24
types of discs so the way he actually is planning to make them is but it's all
2:49:29
about Distributing their electrical energy according to the dis when it's cooling
2:49:35
off so he has some ideas on how to how to put the charges in what places
2:49:42
like six so yeah yeah he he has he has some ideas how to make one side positive
2:49:47
one side negative one disc fully positive one disc fully negative so yeah
2:49:52
he has a plan on that but we should also make a plan on how to actually make them
2:49:58
more durable so gerid I was actually wondering you told you said last time
2:50:05
that it's possible to put in some what do you call
2:50:11
fiberglass fiberglass okay we can't really hear you muted yeah fiberglass
2:50:17
fiberglass and you don't think it'll it'll disrupt our electrical Fields inside it electrical energy that we
2:50:24
inserted no uh it will change it a Teensy tiny bit but not enough to matter
2:50:31
okay okay yeah yeah I mean we're here to test you'll be able to spin it so much faster that it does not matter okay it's
2:50:38
true true so what you just apply to the
2:50:43
mixture so it if if you put layers of
2:50:50
fiberglass and you dip it into the the wax right or you have all already going you pour the wax onto it right and then
2:50:59
while it is cooling you apply the really positive or really negative voltage so
2:51:06
that that voltage is in there the entire time it is cooling yes that's how I
2:51:12
understand it I have never made one true yes yes that's correct yeah yeah
2:51:20
dark go okay cool yeah sure now I was actually thinking you take like flakes
2:51:26
or fiberglass and you just Chuck it inside the soup mix it up spill it onto
2:51:31
the no have to actually take a sheet yep if if you use just like Flex
2:51:38
in there and you just mix in Flex that's not enough to like keep it from separating you want the fabric in there
2:51:44
so that as both ends of the spinning disc are pulling apart that fabric will keep it together if you
2:51:52
have just these random pieces it'll still want to fly apart is that affordable in a shop to actually go buy
2:51:58
fiberglass in a yeah you can you can buy like a a one meter Square sheet you know
2:52:05
thing of fiberglass and you just cut it you know in circles um and yeah you can
2:52:12
buy that for I don't know probably 30 to 100 EUR I mean you could get I've seen
2:52:19
people make carbon fiber um for their cars oh okay right you get like a carbon
2:52:27
fiber thing like this and you put the epoxy resin on it and um it's like
2:52:32
carbon fiber glass right yeah yes yes that that bro that's exactly how people
2:52:37
in Russia here are making well sort of cheap but uh Budgy plates buddy armor
2:52:44
plates they take the fiberglass and with the with the layers
2:52:49
they take like layers thick layers of fiberglass around 2 cm thick and they
2:52:54
dip it into epoxy more like they just painted paint every single layer they cut it out into a nice form or hexagon
2:53:02
form they call the the triangle of Life the the back and the front and yeah so
2:53:07
we actually were I want to say forced but that was quite fun we actually had
2:53:13
to learn that in here in University for safety reasons wow
2:53:19
yeah I want to say I want to say it's something like six or eight layers is
2:53:25
enough to stop a uh 223 round an AR round um and if you want something that
2:53:33
can stop like a 308 or a larger caliber um you need something like 12 to 16
2:53:39
layers but yeah if you use 16 layers of this stuff you're pretty much
2:53:45
bulletproof except for a 50 cal a 50 cal can go he that thing not not stop that
2:53:50
thing Jesus we haven't found any magic yet for that but we will that's what future is
2:53:56
made for to make some anti-gravity Mi 9550 Cal repelling body
2:54:04
armor so actually right now there are tanks that have um I don't want to call
2:54:10
it like an electromagnetic Shield but it is basically an electromagnetic Shield what they do is they will send out a
2:54:17
pulse a shock wave um it detects the incoming uh RPG and it
2:54:25
sends out a shock wve and it slows the RPG down so that it can't go through so
2:54:31
that it just like hits on the outside and the outside is all super hardened so
2:54:36
it it slows it down slows down that's cool that's nice but but I
2:54:45
still see tanks burning on in m in Ukraine Dumas K I don't think we're
2:54:51
going to get that fancy technology anytime soon so first have to go I I
2:54:57
don't think I don't think those are being used over in Ukraine right now I think those are the US Special like we
2:55:06
have tested this and we know that it works but it's not to the point where they can put it on all the tanks yet
2:55:22
all
2:55:35
right okay okay we're still
2:55:45
increasing okay it's maximum 16
2:55:55
kilow CER all right we're moving on to the
2:56:15
catcher Got 5 minutes 5 minutes of rotating that
2:56:21
knob we're making
2:56:26
history hey everyone that makes history needs some needs some kind of glasses and obviously I have the minus eight
2:56:32
glasses Jesus wow yeah hey and plus it
2:56:38
came by jeans my family's ancestors you know that's that stuff but you know you get some laser surgery and then it all
2:56:45
goes to zero and then you're like good to go okay
2:57:47
that
2:58:17
for for
2:58:56
for
3:00:17
ult
3:00:28
now we cheting them both this is the part where we go
3:00:46
quiet
3:01:16
e
3:01:46
e e
3:03:16
for
3:03:46
for
3:04:16
for
3:04:46
e for
3:05:25
for
3:06:00
oh time out
3:06:16
one
3:06:46
for
3:07:16
for
3:07:46
e
3:08:16
for
3:08:46
for for
3:09:33
you C the moment pressing the
3:09:41
button oh no bro
3:09:47
hey we can't hear it bro we can't hear you mute button mute
3:09:53
amazing this video Break yeah yeah I can hear you oh Alex dropped
3:10:03
outex ah well that was interesting Alex
3:10:11
K the EMP or something CA him a drop out L signal
3:10:18
Alex he might have to field from the grab a flyer it
3:10:25
must have with this internet hey hey I swear it almost lifted off from one side and
3:10:30
then it felt like it was too heavy that's it tilted but I mean look at that thing that thing's like 50 cm diameter thing's
3:10:38
big I've never had it able to do that so I said that's the success
3:10:44
we H see I oh jeez gravel flyer kicked out Alex so I've had I've had it where
3:10:52
yeah part of what's happening is there's an energy going back and forth from the catcher to the grav aier and back and
3:10:58
forth and when the energy gets to be too strong from the Tesla coil the catcher
3:11:05
um it can affect stuff uh 10 years away well yeah so I
3:11:12
have like one of those lights that you just touch it and it turns on right it's a touch light
3:11:17
yeah and that thing di out it on at 10 meters away through three walls wait is
3:11:24
on the line oh
3:11:49
it
3:12:04
worked the sound it sounded more like a it wasn't the speed up sound that I
3:12:13
thought I couldn't hear it mostly noise cancelling
3:12:18
you'll have to go back and um listen to the recording I know I'm going to rewatch
3:12:23
that about 20 times
3:12:43
today I would recommend saving the video in at least two other
3:12:53
spots okay uh Alex said that his Wi-Fi got completely shut down and I think he
3:13:02
he didn't check the computer because he didn't see it but I think he saw said computer also shut down surprise
3:13:09
surprise wow no it seems like as soon as that craft was attempting to take off it
3:13:15
like really as you said it released some kind of EMP and shut down Wi-Fi all the
3:13:21
and that like judges the moment determines the the moment when it actually takes off
3:13:26
that's actually verifies the fact that Alex actually said that he only manages to make a video of it in the air mostly
3:13:36
only sometimes that he actually managed to capture it when it's a very big distance because of the as you said EMP
3:13:43
wow I'm feeling good we're moving yeah now we need to increase the distance so
3:13:49
we can capture and take off who's ready to go to Portugal yeah now I know
3:13:55
exactly how Vision Bo lot okay yeah yeah if
3:14:05
Alexis is willing we're willing to get on a plane like hey hey that's not fair
3:14:13
man no that's cool it's cool that's true I will con like sa he's okay with it I
3:14:19
mean we're supporting him we're helping him out bro and plus we need to get him
3:14:24
the equipment so that he can actually deter whoa hold up I got to tell him
3:14:29
about it not to touch the not to touch the let me try and get
3:14:34
him touch him
3:15:00
PA
3:15:05
need uh no well I actually want to tell Alex to check up on the The Catcher And the
3:15:15
ultrasound generator May I mean we don't really have a device right now to determine
3:15:21
the frequency but at least we might have a clue somewhere roughly where it
3:15:27
stopped
3:15:50
that guy's dead
3:15:56
okay okay good thing we we made a video should we go for round four or
3:16:03
should we take a break who wants to go for round
3:16:10
four not touched the dials yet can you have him use a pen or a marker
3:16:17
and just put a little Mark for where they're currently yeah yeah The Catcher And um
3:16:25
what is that thing generator yeah that true that's true that's my actually
3:16:31
help all right so hands up who's ready for round two round round four let's go
3:16:38
hands up ready I don't know if he's tired yet yeah that's true maybe we should
3:16:44
give Alexa like a break maybe like 30 minutes an hour to cool off but I feel
3:16:50
like the energy is in the air and he's ready to take get it up and running this
3:16:55
time let's just get in touch with him find out if his Wi-Fi is working yeah
3:17:09
no so Charles you were saying your observ It Off
3:17:17
thought it lifting up that's pretty good it was you know tilting so I'd say
3:17:23
that's a success we've saw it live I I feel like I didn't really see
3:17:28
the I wasn't getting close enough temp or something I only saw it after already about halfway tip off did it do any
3:17:38
little no
3:17:44
yeah so you think you learned enough from this tuning video now you know how to do
3:17:50
it I think watching him do it three times has given me so much more insight
3:17:57
into his process um my Tesla coil is not
3:18:03
currently in a good spot I burnt out too many MOS bets so I need to build that circuit again
3:18:12
um yeah
3:18:18
yeah Alex's original design didn't have any resistor potentiometer so if you
3:18:23
went all the way the one side it would overheat the transistor I wonder if his new design maybe fix that or maybe he
3:18:30
just knows not to turn it all the way or and I'd be very curious if he used any
3:18:36
diodes with the Slayer circuit so that it shunts the power from the
3:18:42
gate because his other design wasn't using a diode
3:18:48
and it was just saying hey gate have 2,000 volts ac and and your gate goes
3:18:57
poop I spoke with Alexa just now Jesus he explained that number one the Wi-Fi
3:19:04
was completely Switched Off any electrical components that he had on
3:19:10
including his heater was also switched off the computer he said the computer
3:19:15
absolutely like it didn't die out essentially it got a
3:19:22
blue screen he I mean it like froze got a blue screen nothing's on it he's trying
3:19:28
to reboot it and it's not rebooting so he said he uh he wants to make a four
3:19:35
number four attempt to start up the gravelot but before the time runs out he wants to take the computer to repair
3:19:41
shop to actually fix it and when he comes back he I I recommend him to try again number four when the gravel if the
3:19:49
gravel takes off by that time when it takes off he will make a live video call
3:19:54
or at least some kind of recording of this glorious attempt
3:20:00
number four I mean we got it to flip need to take off how about how about this um since he has to go get the
3:20:07
computer repaired today anyways that might we don't know how long that's going to take um how about we just
3:20:13
schedule like another call like tomorrow or Sunday or Monday or you
3:20:19
know probably if I had to guess Monday or Tuesday because you
3:20:25
know the computer shop probably is not open on Sunday so if it takes more than today is
3:20:33
still Friday for him so that's why he's he still has some daylight so I hope he managed actually
3:20:39
to go right now to the shop and actually fix computer because we could really it'd be really useful we could make
3:20:45
another video call because on the phone phone if he damages the phone I don't think that's going to be nice we don't
3:20:50
want that no no we need to keep his phone safe what I'm getting at though is that we don't know the damage to his
3:20:56
computer and so uh we might take yeah and it'd be nice if I could sleep
3:21:03
sometime because I I pull all nighters every time we have these meetings bro
3:21:09
what time is that your place no well right now it's 7:30 but we started at 4
3:21:15
a.m. so I'm already a night owl but like I usually have to go to sleep by about
3:21:21
seven or eight am if okay yeah that's cool I sleep from
3:21:28
like 8 to noon or 8 to 1 and then I get up and I start working again and I you
3:21:34
know night yeah I work from like noon until like 5: am and then I go to bed and then
3:21:41
on these days where we have the meetings you know it's like noon to 8:00 a.m.
3:21:47
right so it's all afternoon alling that's
3:21:54
cool nighttime is work time yeah dur the whole day he just sleeps nobody bothers
3:22:00
you no one bothers you exactly I'm sleeping I'm not bothering him he loves it all right cool all right right now
3:22:05
it's like almost 11 at my place I also need to go sleep you need too okay the
3:22:12
Wi-Fi is down the computer's down hopefully gets that repaired I will discuss with Alexa when we can actually
3:22:18
make a new meeting because that was some real vo magic right there I want all three legs to take off I want
3:22:25
that I want to see his gaze of Glory his all his effort putting into actually
3:22:32
progress results now that's what we're talking about now I believe that if we actually excuse me if we actually add
3:22:39
the electric discs with the right composition yo that thing is going to shoot up because I mean we're it's
3:22:47
possible right now we just need to find the right materials the right
3:22:52
frequency set it up calibrated properly and that thing we need to actually be able to control that energy amen y so so
3:23:01
Mel um so as soon as Alexi gets back to you let's try to make sure our our next
3:23:08
meeting um is not for at least 24 hours right that way we can make sure we're
3:23:13
all able to like attend right if you put it too soon there's a chance we might not see the message in time so at least
3:23:21
one day out that's one thing uh the second thing if you could when you talk
3:23:27
to Alexi go through that list of questions that we gave you um and any of
3:23:33
the ones that we didn't get a chance to ask yes I was actually planning to answer all these questions when he
3:23:38
actually finished his test but seems like his computer died out I get you yes I will confront I will have a separate
3:23:44
call with him to answer all the questions of course or or just just to tell him the questions or for the questions on it and then he can tell us
3:23:51
you know in our next meeting in like two or three days sure sure or he could just
3:23:56
make a voice call or voice mail yeah or that okay and and he he can he can just
3:24:03
use his phone and make a recording if you know he drops off his computer he can go home tonight put his phone down
3:24:10
do a recording and then just upload that recording to like Google drive or something and send us a link
3:24:16
no that's true but won't this so-called EMP damages phone is
3:24:22
okay we don't want to blue screen on a phone wrap wrap tin foil around
3:24:27
it ah smart why not who knows what's gonna happen W actually I wouldn't I
3:24:34
wouldn't do that I I don't don't wrap tin foil that that would be bad just you
3:24:39
don't have to do anything just put the phone yet distance the the best thing
3:24:46
would be distance because I pretty sure I remember some videos that he made of the actually the first the first very
3:24:52
first videos that he made he actually made the grael lot in some kind of sort of forest a greeny region and there was
3:25:00
a distance of about 50 m I think right now which just work is distance if we have a good distance we might actually
3:25:06
be able to capture the moment of a takeoff that's what I want the takeoff moment that's the goal right there and
3:25:12
the EMP only I think it only happens when the thing tips over uh I I haven't
3:25:17
noticed it when when it doesn't do that because when it tips over the fields collapse so quickly and it's that
3:25:24
collaps that really maybe maybe yeah yes they the distribution of that energy
3:25:29
maybe yeah all right let's call day all right
3:25:35
cool let's finish today thank you gentlemen for this great meeting I mean we got some great progress
3:25:42
today I will find out what's the next I'll be looking forward to the next meeting with all of you and
3:25:51
let's I'm excited for the electric discs so yeah I really want that that thing
3:25:56
attached to it and get it rolling I'll find out where we can get the fiberglass to attach to make the electrc more
3:26:02
durable I want that hardcore machine rolling all right
3:26:07
gentlemen have a good day thank you okay
