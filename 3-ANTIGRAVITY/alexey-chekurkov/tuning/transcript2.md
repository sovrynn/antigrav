Got it — here’s a cleaned, readable version. I trimmed filler, music notes, and repeated lines; added punctuation; and grouped ideas so it flows.

# Edited transcript (clarified & lightly organized)

**Context:** Live call while Alex operates a craft with rotating discs, high voltage, a “catcher,” and an ultrasonic generator. Team is remote on Skype, trying to observe, measure, and avoid another EMP-like event that previously knocked devices offline.

---

**Startup & camera**

* “Oh my God — no, not the EMP… wait. Is his phone video still on? Let me call him.”
* “All right, there we go. Okay, okay…”
* Request to use the phone’s camera for better quality. Concern about another EMP taking out the computer/Wi-Fi like last time.

**Multimeter & ultrasound**

* “He tried the multimeter on the catcher; it throws an error. It can’t read the catcher. We still need to try the ultrasonic generator.”
* Plan: measure just the ultrasound frequency with the meter (ultrasound on; no other changes).

**Environment & setup**

* Question: “Will the racks behind the device affect the field around the craft since they’re close?”
  Answer: “Shouldn’t affect anything.”
* “We’re starting up. Wait five minutes… I think we’re okay.”

**Power-up & motors**

* “He’s applying high voltage to the disc — slowly.”
* “Motors are only at 10 V; they can go to 12 V.”
* “He modified rotor positions; they’re closer now.”
* Goal: hold constant speed and parameters while observing.

**Materials discussion (graphite/magnetic powder)**

* “Anyone have access to graphite and magnetic powder? Cost per gram?”
  “Under \$100 for several kg. Graphite powder is inexpensive — about \$20 per quart.”
* Need the **right type** of graphite to increase conductivity; confirm specifications.
* Note: graphite used on aluminum/3D prints for electroplating.

**Disc spacing**

* “If he has measurements of the top/bottom disc spacing, share the exact distance. If not, we’ll have him measure.”

**Oscilloscopes & language**

* “Checked Amazon Spain — none with Russian language, likely due to sanctions.”
* “Alex hasn’t found one locally; he’ll look online (AliExpress may have Russian-language options).”

**Disc composition**

* Lab in Krasnoyarsk contacted to make a specific electric-disc composition (iron, antimony, neodymium, etc.). Goal: a disc that won’t break at high RPM and may improve results.

**Possible arcing**

* “Ask Alex if there’s arcing on the right vertical post — around the center disc and bottom bracket.”
  Confirmed: **electrical sparks**, mostly from the lower disc.

**Background sound**

* Ramping noise heard. Determined to be **mechanical vibration** from imperfect motor–disc coupling; not balanced perfectly.

**Rotation directions (theory)**

* Team notes: With two rotating discs, they want **lower disc clockwise** (opposing Earth’s rotation) and the **top disc** in the opposite direction, aiming for desired field effects.

**Loss of state & reset**

* “He lost it.” Wait for fields to dissipate before next steps.

**Measuring ultrasound frequency (detailed)**

* Instructions for the meter:

  * Set selector to **white “V” at 10** (not blue).
  * Press the **blue button** until the display shows **Hz** on the right.
  * Probe the **metal** posts behind the clock where the white wires exit (screw posts; top likely open).
  * Confirm ultrasound is **ON** when measuring; otherwise shows nothing.
* Some back-and-forth; language mixing caused confusion. Eventually confirmed the meter and probe placement. Will test frequency later to avoid interrupting regulation attempts.

**Thermals on the catcher**

* Question: “When the catcher’s potentiometer is at minimum, its transistor overheats. Fixed?”
  Answer: It **still heats up**; Alex uses **computer thermal paste (GR-1)** instead of a heatsink/fan. Working so far.

**Field build-up protocol**

* “We’re heating the toroidal fields with rotating ‘etheric’ energy for \~10 minutes.”
* Strategy: **Increase high voltage slowly** to form **stable toroidal fields** on the rotating discs.

**Reviewing external video**

* Alex will review Charles’s video later and comment on modifications.

**Tuning, parameters, and replication**

* Suggestion: send Charles’s kit to Alex for tuning.
  Counterpoint: Without **numbers** (disc spacing, RPM, catcher/ultrasound frequencies), regulation is guesswork. Need those parameters from a successful lift or strong effect, then share for replication.

**Time zones & logistics**

* Charles in Texas (7:30 a.m.); facilitator in evening; Portugal team midday.

**Catcher activation & “bouncing”**

* After activating the catcher, wait 5–10 seconds, then **sweep the knob left/right** to **stretch/compress** the fields on the rotating discs (“make them bounce”).

**Skype & recording**

* Request for a second camera/phone to record.
* Help sent to install Skype via link/WhatsApp.
* Note: a high-quality setup video (>100 MB) exists but is too large to share easily without compression.

**Weather & spacing**

* Weather changes forced **reduced disc spacing**; still experimental — no exact “takeoff” threshold known yet.

**Kits sold**

* Two kits sold (France and Middle East). One buyer didn’t finish payment (no instructions); the other blew the catcher and didn’t replace it. No confirmed third-party successes reported.

**Run attempts & intermittent effects**

* Multiple regulation cycles with long intervals. Occasional stabilization, then loss.
* Toward the end: “Yes… oh my God — not the EMP — phone video still on? Call him.”
  Wi-Fi also went down, similar to the previous incident.

---

# Key points & takeaways

* **Electrical arcing** observed (especially lower disc). Safety and reliability risk.
* **Precise parameters needed**: disc spacing (mm), RPM, catcher frequency, ultrasound frequency. Without these, tuning is guesswork.
* **Ultrasound frequency measurement** process agreed but deferred mid-run to avoid disruption.
* **Thermal issue** on the catcher at low pot setting persists; mitigated with **thermal paste**, not a heatsink/fan.
* **Rotation strategy**: lower disc clockwise, top disc counter to pursue target field behavior.
* **Environment matters**: weather prompted spacing adjustments.
* **Repeatable effect** still pending; some events coincide with **device/Wi-Fi disruptions**.

# Open questions

1. Exact **disc spacing** (top vs. bottom) during runs?
2. Measured **RPM** during “best” stability moments?
3. Actual **catcher** and **ultrasound** frequencies when effects appear?
4. Can arcing be reduced (clearances, insulation, smoothing edges)?
5. Would a proper **heatsink/fan** improve catcher reliability vs. just paste?

# Suggested next steps

* Before next run, capture:

  * Disc spacing (mm), exact RPM.
  * Ultrasound frequency (meter set to Hz as described).
  * Catcher output frequency/behavior at noted knob positions.
* Add a **secondary recording device** (phone on a tripod) away from the rig to survive any local disruption.
* Inspect and mitigate **arcing points** on the lower disc and right vertical post.
* Consider a **heatsink/fan** for the catcher transistor if heating is recurrent.

If you’d like, I can drop this into a neatly formatted doc or pull out just the **step-by-step measurement checklist**.


# transcript

oh oh my God no no the EMP no BR no wait wait but
0:22
his phone video still on let me call him let me call
0:28
him e
1:26
right
1:44
all right there we go
2:07
okay okay
2:28
wow for
3:01
that's good one most important we
3:15
see just it's okay
3:53
m [Music]
4:09
he's explaining that he tried to use the multimeter on The Catcher And it's it's showing that error so yeah that that
4:18
thing can't read the the catcha but would we still have yet to try the ult
4:24
sound generator
4:42
[Music] I need more
4:47
coffee
4:54
wow okay check in the catcher everything's working well the racks in the background
5:01
affect the field around the gravier H sorry come will the racks in the background
5:08
affect the field around the grav fire because it's so close to
5:21
it no I don't think the shs will affect anything no okay can you
5:27
ask all right we starting
5:40
up we're right now wait five minutes
5:53
for I think we're okay
6:04
about Shing I have actually heard some
6:09
that material in
6:37
[Laughter]
6:52
five five minutes
6:59
[Laughter] uh no I told him to use the camera on
7:06
his cell phone but as it appears he is not using his cell phone
7:13
camera Alex
7:46
Skype I want to see the quality on his phone so I ask him to make a
7:55
picture I hope we're not going to get any EMP that destroys the computer again that's not
8:28
cool e
9:22
yes yeah so right now he's applying the high voltage on the disc slowly slowly
9:29
I
9:37
think
9:48
yes yep the motors are only at 10 volts I think they go higher to 12
9:57
Vols you
10:23
no still the same Mal
10:49
what
10:59
yes yes the rotors the Alex said he modified he changed the position of the
11:05
rotors right now they're
11:23
closer right now we need to focus on the on the craft we play around later with all the Skype cameras
11:58
so yeah he's he's picking up the speed to keep it at constant all at the same
12:13
parameters
12:22
yeah see yes more that yeah it's okay
12:29
uh gentlemen here's a question does anyone of you have any access to
12:34
graphite and magnetic powder how much would how much would it cost on your
12:41
side per gram is it expensive no no not too expensive proba
12:47
under 100 us
12:53
orgr um for yeah a few kilogram uh for a
12:58
few maybe almost okay I I will check on my side
13:05
because I also have a laboratory here no they also they also have this
13:11
graphite material sld in small small bottles I'll check up on their price umin specifically mentioned that
13:20
you can actually use the graphite powder for our Electro discs that will greatly
13:27
benefit them graphite power um one quart is like
13:36
$20 for a gram yeah for a quart I've got let me see I've got it one here
13:50
actually yeah yeah graphic
14:07
we need to find out we first need to find out what kind of type because and there's a lot of types we we
14:14
want the one that actually increases the conductivity of the material that's the
14:19
one we want yeah well graphite is conductive that's what I use it for I put it on aluminum PR 3D printed prints
14:27
and then I electroplate it experimenting with that all right cool
14:34
yeah if he took measurements of the current spacing of
14:41
the discs knows how many millimeters away the top and bottom discs are right
14:48
now you would like to know distance if he already knows it if not we'll have
14:54
him measure yeah we can do that e
15:30
uh I looked at all of the oscilloscopes on Amazon Spain and none of them have
15:40
Russian oh gee I wonder why I think it's the sanctions can't can't imagine why
15:46
well you would think that it's it's just a program like I'm not asking for the front plate to
15:53
be Alex
16:24
online
16:36
[Music]
16:48
okay yeah right Alex also hasn't really
16:53
found any oscilloscope in his town so he will look check up some online which can
16:59
actually use and understand and he'll send a link there is some on Ali Express that
17:07
might have a Russian option okay I express why
17:18
notbe inase also also I just had a call today I contacted
17:26
one of my Laboratories in krask they're also
17:31
making different compositions of metals so right now I'm waiting for an update
17:37
from them if they can actually make this composition of electric discs in the
17:42
chat in the Skype chat I have sent a description of the compound that was
17:48
used in moin's disc there's a bunch of iron and timony neodium
17:56
neodium all all these um very special compounds we managed to put
18:02
them all together add them into the disc that will not break when we
18:09
rotate at high speed and we might actually get a good decent enough result from it good effect from
18:23
it and I can't wait to find any update on aano his his little craft F that's
18:57
beautiful for
19:57
my e
20:50
M yeah what's up can you ask Alexi if there is arcing on your right
20:59
vertical post it looks like there is arcing around where it goes through the
21:05
center disc as well as where it connects to the bottom
21:18
bracket okay come again where you where are you seeing arcing between the rotation disc and the central one yes
21:25
the vertical post on the right side along that vertical post it looks
21:32
like in the middle and at the bottom there is aring vertical
21:41
post
21:51
okay on the center
22:20
uhhuh hold on hold on I need
22:40
yeah there is interesting yeah
23:27
forone e
24:11
not 4K better it's
24:17
nice CER catcher yes the big
24:25
man I have another question yes in the background I hear what sounds
24:32
like a ramping sound and I want to know if that is his
24:40
computer fan or if that is the gra F sound hold up let me hear
24:51
it Alex
25:09
okay yeah the
25:19
motors he's saying the context between the motors and the dis they're not exactly
25:26
professional 100% but they're holding that's why they're not exactly balanced
25:31
that's that's why because the vibrating sound
26:04
mhm one very important thing that's mikin mentioned was the rotation of the discs especially for our sake because we
26:11
have two different two we have two rotation discs instead of one so so-called we're not we're not going to
26:17
speculate that it's true but the so-called planet is rotating
26:23
counterclockwise which means we want the opposite we want anti-gravity we want to be able to go to a higher plane of
26:29
energy field we need to have one disc which is the lower one needs to rotate clockwise against the Earth's
26:37
gravity against the Earth's rotation and then the top one
26:44
rotates yeah I want to be able to hear the gravel fly through everything he's doing so
26:51
let's okay cool
27:09
okay
27:27
started
27:57
e
28:27
for
28:57
e
29:27
e
29:57
for
30:26
for for
31:25
that all yeah he lost it
31:52
[Music] for for
32:29
[Music]
32:39
for all the energy fields to dissipate can you please ask him to use
32:46
the meter to check just the ultrasound frequency right now so just turn on the
32:53
ultrasound only and just measure the frequency on the sound right now
33:26
alexou for
33:49
[Music]
34:14
so yes he explained that he cut the moment he started act creating the pulation on the
34:21
central disc
34:28
the moment passed nice one it's in Spanish
34:36
yeah D so how do we do this do we have to like open the box and
34:42
insert no don't don't touch the frequency knob
35:16
nakak we need to figure out on which knob do we need to turn it good
35:22
enough to check the frequency it it should be just a single knob that says
35:29
h z HZ hurts
35:44
Alex HZ
36:02
yeah
36:22
yeah we need him to make a picture of this panel then we can figure out which one he has to turn show him which
36:30
one I am looking for the order so I can show him on the picture yeah yeah we
36:38
can actually mark it and show him this one this one and just was very interesting while
36:44
the craft was actually rotating working there was a lot of electrical currents
36:50
jumping especially on the lower
36:55
dis something tells me not to touch
37:02
no I was sitting quietly looking again I'm I'm just noticing a lot of
37:11
Sparks let me let me confirm with him but I I believe it's Sparks it they're happening too rapidly too
37:18
often especially on the lower dis wow
37:34
uh Alex
38:05
okay
38:16
okay yes he confirmed that it is electrical SPS mostly they're coming from
38:24
the yeah let's continue
38:32
why so did you find your Pikachu yes trying to find out which knob must
38:39
he
38:52
turn turn on the
39:50
the knob on the 10 the and then just uh
40:10
like you
40:52
Al gerro we must first turn the knob on the 10 and then press
40:59
the the blue button until it's frequency
41:06
right yes we're starting up the high voltage he actually needs to turn it to
41:14
the white V with 10 not the blue V with
41:20
10 but other than that if he puts it on the white V with
41:27
10 and then pushes the blue button once or twice until he
41:33
sees the HZ on the far right side of the screen for
41:39
Hertz then he can take the two probes and right behind the
41:47
clock he has two posts that the white
41:52
wires are going out from so he just needs to take the probes and go tunk
41:57
inside those posts does he actually have to touch the
42:02
naked wire or or just even through the insulation will work no he needs to touch the metal but those posts are just
42:09
screw on type posts and I think the the top of the post is open so he can just
42:15
put the probe down yeah let let me let me find that out Al
42:53
M yes yes this one another
43:26
speech
43:37
for yes yes we can see that yes 10 10 V
44:02
too much uh no to 10
44:10
white yes no and now and now push the blue
44:16
button once do we want this the the blue v the blue 10 or want the white 10 no no
44:22
no no the button the button
44:45
HZ
44:54
HZ no it's still oh oh he no oh he he he switched it back
45:01
to Blue on the on the thing it needs to be at White 10 and then hit the blue button
45:51
it it is also automatic so it might not even require him to push it
45:57
let me try yes one okay just put the just put the
46:03
probes in just put the probes in
46:35
or we can do that yes
46:44
perfect okay so he said they're touching the the wires directly Okay
46:50
cool so is the ultrasound turned on right now
47:04
it's good it's off right now
47:30
m m
48:04
okay who who check it a little bit later we will let him do his thing yes
48:09
bro I'm man hey mixing English technology with
48:15
the Russians
48:27
that
49:20
right we'll test this later so don't disturb him now I'm going to start again
49:53
so Alex is explained now that there was some weather changes on his side so he had to actually decrease the distance
49:59
between the discs which we will find out a little bit later so again it's like it's like playing
50:06
with a new model he has absolutely no idea when it'll take
50:14
off has alexie sold kits to other people other than Russell and
50:21
I let me find that out
50:26
[Laughter] hold
50:34
up that's Galaxy when he gets back there is
50:55
Alex for
51:39
[Music] yes he sold two kits one to a French
51:46
gentleman another one to an Arab the first guy did not finish with the
51:52
payment that's why he did not get the instructions on how to take it off so we have no idea what's happening with him
51:57
the other guy IAB his cater blew
52:02
up and he I mean if he wanted a replacement he had to actually pay for it but he didn't so that's it no update
52:11
on if Alex mentioned that if someone actually did manage to get that get the
52:17
thing model up and running they wouldn't tell us or him definitely I mean we all
52:22
know why I tell I mean yeah I'm still working on it I'm think I'm pretty close but I noticed with the test the coil his
52:28
circuit yeah gets hot when you adjust the potentiometer to the lowest value so
52:34
has he fixed that in this design uh come again which one which
52:41
one's heing up when you turn the potentiometer on the catcher uh to the lowest value it'll overheat the
52:46
transistor has he fixed that Miss design okay
52:52
Al what would we Reg C
53:28
[Music]
53:43
so yes it does heat up uhuh okay yeah we start
53:49
up yes it does heat up what he uses instead of instead of using some
53:55
radiator or fan which is for much more industrial process he uses a thermal
54:01
paste that we use in the computers the gr one and it works so far
54:31
hey at least we're not getting any Sparks right now which proves that the electricity is coming from the high
54:37
voltage
55:43
fore
56:10
yes yes that's
56:19
good don't and now we're heating up the
56:26
tootal Fields with the rotating etherical energy for another 10 minutes
57:21
Alex is explained that you have to create the to roidal
57:28
Fields slowly gently th we have to carefully slowly but surely increase the
57:34
high voltage on the rotation discs to create this stable form of toroto
57:48
fields uh what Alex
57:54
what Charlie on
58:22
yeah Charles he's Alex said that I told about video video he'll check it out at
58:28
his available time and he'll comment on what actually has to be modified so also
58:34
start getting some nice effects
59:05
can I send alexie my kit I built so that he can uh to try to tune
59:21
it the way I see right now we sure you could send it you could send
59:28
his well your model but the way I see it it's we have absolutely no perception or
59:36
idea on how to regulate it yes we can change the the distance between the discs but the
59:43
main the main um focus here is on the frequency on The Catcher And on the
59:51
ultrasonic generator we need to get those numbers we need to get figure out at what point at what distance these
59:58
discs and at what rotation does the actually craft take off when that to
1:00:05
toot fuels actually create in a stable form we get those numbers then we can
1:00:11
start sharing them on different forms of discs regulating them and that's when we
1:00:17
get them all up and
1:00:24
running
1:00:54
e e
1:01:29
it's true it's true if we if if Charles will keep on dragging on his tests on a
1:01:34
wrong wrong model then yes it's basically pointless it would actually
1:01:40
benefit if we if Al say has a look at it and correct it if
1:01:46
necessary uh okay cool I'll ask him I'll ask him
1:01:56
yes yes so we can actually have the right parameters and be able
1:02:07
to make sure alexie can inspect the circuits make sure they're replicated
1:02:13
correctly
1:02:19
sure Charles well what part of the world are you where you located Texas USA uh
1:02:28
what time is it at your place 7:30 a.m. okay so you're you're
1:02:34
morning same as Geral I have evening and the guys in
1:02:40
Portugal have somewhere middle the day okay got
1:02:47
it no I'm I'm just trying to figure out who who's actually closer to to Portugal
1:02:53
I can basically sit on the train and get there
1:03:24
for
1:03:54
e e
1:04:46
Alex
1:05:24
wow
1:05:31
for
1:05:54
yes
1:06:12
for CCH catcher activating
1:06:33
C
1:07:06
yeah yeah so once you activate the catcher give it like five 10 seconds
1:07:12
then you start moving how do you say it turning the knob left and right
1:07:19
trying to stretch out stretch and compress the too fields on the rotation
1:07:24
discs make them bounce
1:07:57
we're starting the
1:08:24
regulat
1:08:54
for
1:09:24
e for
1:10:24
go
1:10:54
e
1:11:24
for e
1:12:06
one 3
1:12:23
two it
1:12:54
one
1:13:05
for does he have a camera he could set up to record
1:13:10
this sorry does he have another camera that he could set up to record
1:13:16
this ah uh
1:13:23
alexone Alex what this
1:13:51
just record the video is fine
1:14:18
up down he needs a link to download Skype
1:14:29
yes Google
1:14:48
playone uh it says we need to we need send the link on WhatsApp and then he'll
1:14:53
be able to get inside his App Store he doesn't even know what he's looking
1:14:59
for just Skype
1:15:53
this don't let him start up don't let him start up yet let make sure he does one thing at a time and we still need to
1:16:00
check the frequency of the ultrasound before he starts again AL
1:16:26
[Laughter]
1:16:34
and he needs to set it to the yellow HZ percent
1:16:40
sign yellow HC I sent a picture I sent a picture look right before the app store
