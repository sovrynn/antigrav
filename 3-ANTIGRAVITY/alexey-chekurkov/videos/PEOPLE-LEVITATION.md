Hello friends, this is the channel Technology from the Garage and I’m Alexey.

Before we start, I have a small request. If you see ads on the channel, please just let them run — that way you support my channel. It won’t cost you anything, but it really helps. Thanks in advance.

Now let’s continue.
Today’s topic: levitation of people — is it possible?

From ancient times, historical documents have survived describing how the Inquisition burned “witches” at the stake. As we know, witches were said to fly — not necessarily on brooms, but they did fly.

So how did they do it? In the records of the Holy Inquisition, they interrogated and wrote down testimonies. The accused described that they would prepare some kind of ointment of unknown composition and rub it all over their body. This affected the nervous system.

When the nervous system is in an altered, excited state, its properties change. It has been proven that in altered states, the nervous system can allow levitation. Not only levitation, but other changes occur: telepathy, vivid dreams, and so on. One property of the body in this altered state is the ability to levitate.

1:47
So let’s talk about levitation. Putting aside the myths, let’s be more serious. Is it possible for humans to fly?

Looking back through history, we already talked about witches. There’s also the author of The Malleus Maleficarum (“The Witch’s Hammer”), who described these alleged abilities in detail.

2:25
Now, let’s consider modern experiments. Scientists have made frogs levitate using superconductors and magnetic fields. A frog is largely made of water — about half water — and yet it can levitate under the right conditions. That’s been proven experimentally.

3:18
Now, I want to show you some videos. For example, recordings of people with mental illness in altered states of consciousness. In such states, the body can hover and levitate. This is real footage, not editing.

4:08
In Russia, there were also “holy fools” (yurodivy), people with altered consciousness who could predict the future. Similar states of mind sometimes opened channels for prophecy, visions, or unusual abilities. But here we are focusing not on prediction, but on levitation — captured on camera in a Chinese hospital, for example.

5:11
Another case: a woman was recorded levitating above her bed while asleep. She didn’t know until she noticed unexplained bruises and set up a night-vision camera. The recording showed her rising above the bed. Again, in an altered state, channels in the body seem to open that allow levitation.

6:06
There’s also a video sent by a viewer: a girl in a forest seen levitating under the watchful eye of her mother. The witness’s dog tried to chase them, but the two quickly disappeared.

7:00
So let’s analyze. We have levitation in altered states of consciousness — people who are unwell. But here, the girl seemed completely healthy, yet she levitated. Maybe consciousness can also be altered in ways that aren’t obvious.

7:35
Let’s add a scientific angle. Look at storm clouds: they contain up to 10 tons of water suspended in the sky. Sometimes even more — 30 to 40 tons. All that mass hangs above us. Why? Because of electrostatics. Clouds carry positive charges on top, negative on the bottom, like the plates of a capacitor. The Earth itself also has charges, and these interact. Water stays suspended until the charges balance, and then it falls as rain.

8:32
So if a human body is made mostly of water, why can’t humans levitate the same way? Perhaps because the body’s charge doesn’t align with Earth’s. But if a person could change their body’s frequency to resonate with the Earth, then levitation would become possible.

11:20
This might explain historical cases of monks who, in prayer, reportedly lifted off the ground. Their altered nervous systems tuned their bodies into resonance, and they levitated.

12:35
That’s today’s main topic. If you found it interesting, leave a comment. I have more research and theories, but the video is already long. If you’d like me to continue, let me know in the comments and I’ll make more.

That’s all for today. Thanks for watching. Goodbye, friends — see you next time!
