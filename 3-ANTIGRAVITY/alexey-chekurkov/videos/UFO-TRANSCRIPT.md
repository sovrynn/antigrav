What kind of UFO (unidentified flying object) are you?

They’ve been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth. When we imagine them, we usually picture the classic flying saucer—either shaped like an upside-down plate, a hat, or even a tassel. But some UFOs look completely different, like glowing orbs or strange shapes.

Where do they come from, and why are they here? I’ve put together a video archive of sightings from different times and continents, including some of the most interesting close-up encounters.

Here, we see an object with some kind of structure underneath—maybe landing gear? It’s unclear, but it’s clearly not CGI, as this was filmed long before modern computer graphics.

Another old recording from California, USA, shows a small object. Back then, drones didn’t exist, so this couldn’t have been a drone. There’s no room for a human inside—it’s too small.

Here’s a classic disc-shaped UFO, beautifully captured. Then we see oval ones, some transforming mid-flight. Some just look like bright spots before vanishing.

One of the most stunning clips was filmed in the USA—it’s the longest footage we have. Let’s analyze it:

    The object is clearly artificial, likely made of metal.

    It’s not a hologram—it has physical mass.

    It hovers without any visible propulsion (no jets, fans, etc.).

    It rotates and flips, suggesting it manipulates gravity.

    It reflects sunlight, possibly metallic, and might even be inhabited.

    Its flight seems unstable at times before it suddenly disappears.

All signs point to this being real footage.

Most UFOs are disc-shaped, which makes sense—it’s the most aerodynamic form after a sphere. But it’s also practical: a disc allows maximum interior space in a compact design (like how boats feel bigger inside than they look).

Some UFOs fly openly over cities, not even trying to hide. Others, like this one filmed from a plane in England in the 1960s, have an elliptical shape with four wing-like structures—but they don’t seem to be for flight control.

Some UFOs merge together or collapse inward, as if absorbing space. Others, like this multi-faceted disc, are mesmerizing. Crowds often react with awe, confirming these are real sightings.

In Mexico, another UFO was filmed—mysterious and eerie. Witnesses report feeling negative energy, fear, or even mental disturbances afterward. Some speculate they emit infrasound (like 13 Hz), which induces terror.

Here’s a spherical, multi-faceted UFO filmed in Mexico—another incredible capture.

Some UFOs have landing gear, but its purpose is unclear. Others are cylindrical, glowing from within, suggesting advanced, possibly extraterrestrial tech.

Then there are bizarre, non-aerodynamic shapes—like this one that looks like a floating "cow" with rotating parts. Clearly artificial, but who knows what its creators were thinking?

Some UFOs resemble atmospheric phenomena, while others look like laser projections—but their movement is too complex for man-made lasers.

There are even reports of "sky platforms," similar to what Viktor Grebennikov described—his anti-gravity device looked like a glowing cloud.

Conclusion: UFOs are real, and their technology surpasses ours. They defy gravity, inertia, and move in ways we can’t explain—instant acceleration, vanishing, and silent flight.
Part 2: The Physics Behind UFOs

Now, let’s talk about the technology behind these objects. Many inventors have tried to crack anti-gravity:

    Ancient Vimanas (India, 1875) – Texts describe flying machines powered by heated mercury. A man named Shivkar Talpade built a prototype that flew in 1895—years before the Wright brothers. The design involved mercury, electricity, and mirrors.

    Nazi Bell (Die Glocke) – A German WWII project using rotating mercury-like fluid ("Xerum 525," possibly red mercury) under high voltage.

    Viktor Schauberger’s Repulsine (1922) – A flying disc with counter-rotating disks, possibly manipulating gravity.

    John Searl’s Disc – Magnetic rollers creating lift, resembling mushroom gills or honeycombs.

    Viktor Grebennikov’s Platform – Used vibrating honeycomb structures to generate "anti-gravity" effects.

How does it work?

    Structured resonators (like honeycombs or layered discs) create wave interference (possibly de Broglie waves).

    When activated (by vibration, electricity, or magnetism), they disrupt gravity (or etheric pressure, as some theories suggest).

    Examples: Beetle wings have microstructures that glow under microscopes—possibly a natural anti-gravity effect.

Other experiments:

    Mark’s Levitation Box (Bulgaria) – Uses copper tubes filled with activated carbon (like Grebennikov’s design).

    Dr. Leik Myrabo’s "Lightcraft" (1978) – A spinning mirror reflects laser light, creating explosive thrust pulses.

    Flying Triangles – Some UFOs use light bursts for propulsion.

Final Thoughts:
UFOs use physics we don’t yet understand—possibly involving resonance, electromagnetism, and ether manipulation. The evidence is overwhelming: these objects are real, and their technology is far beyond ours.
