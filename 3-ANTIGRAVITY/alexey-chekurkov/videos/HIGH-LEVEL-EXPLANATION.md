Hello friends, Alexey here with the channel Technologies and Expensive.
Today’s topic: antigravity. I’ll try to explain Shuster’s theory, dig into what gravity depends on, and methods of overcoming it.

0:19
The idea of antigravity is not new. Machines to overcome it existed long ago.
In ancient logic, take for example the Vimana Shastra — it describes vimanas (flying machines) with their drawings, designs, and instructions. This suggests they really existed, not just fantasy, since the descriptions are detailed.

1:13
Even more recently, at the end of the 19th–early 20th century, one Russian family tried to build a vimana. The wife was a translator of Sanskrit, the husband a mechanic. They translated the texts and tried to build one. The story was even reported in an Indian technical magazine or newspaper. But later the device was taken over by an English firm, and its fate became unknown.

1:47
Now, about gravity. Let’s take an analogy. Why are all the planets round? Think of bubbles in water — they too form spheres. Or a drop of water falling in air — also spherical. This shows that planets are pressed into a round shape by a dense medium. Like bubbles in space.

2:51
Even the solar system looks like an atom — the Sun as the nucleus, planets as electrons. From this one can conclude: gravity doesn’t “exist” in itself; it is pressure from the ether (a dense medium filling space). That’s why planets are round — like bubbles under pressure.

3:35
Someone might object: but planets have different masses. However, I claim gravity depends on volume, not mass. For example, two planets of equal volume but different densities would still have the same gravity, since the ether presses equally on their volume.

5:01
So how can we counteract this ether pressure? In 1922, Viktor Schauberger built the first model of a machine with a rotating magnetic field. That was one clue: rotation of a magnetic field can overcome etheric pressure — what we call gravity.

5:54
Later came Searl’s generator — also based on rotating magnetic fields. The design looks simple, “as cheap as three kopeks,” but there are hidden tricks. The real working principle wasn’t disclosed in replications.

6:31
So the first key: rotating magnetic fields can act as a barrier or umbrella against ether pressure, letting objects overcome gravity.

7:02
Then Roshchin and Godin built their disks — two rotating, one stationary — basically like an electric motor turned sideways. Even earlier, Charles noted that rapidly rotating magnetic fields create vertical forces. The Germans in the Third Reich also tried similar disk machines.

9:03
Imagine a bubble in liquid: if you discharge space above it, it rises upward. In the same way, by creating a void in the ether using magnetic fields, you can make an object float, rise, or move sideways. That is the first real hint.

9:23
So the task is to build such a construction.

9:56
Now let’s move to the garage. I’ll show you what I’ve managed to achieve with this same “pandemotor” method (used, he claims, even in the Third Reich).

10:11
Here, I’m assembling a new disk for experiments. When it’s done, I’ll post a new video. But that’s not the most interesting part — I have another experiment in progress (still secret). As soon as I receive some mercury — maybe 20–50 grams — I’ll continue that test.

10:51
Also, I’m working on Tesla-style experiments, and building a “needle resonator” for reproducing Grebennikov’s platform (but with artificial materials instead of insect wings).

11:19
So as you see, the work is ongoing. Soon, maybe, we’ll fly. The “gravitsapa” (antigravity device) is almost ready — just final touches left. Then I’ll show it in operation.

11:40
For now, I had to redesign it with different materials, since I didn’t have what I needed. But the principle remains the same — a Schauberger-type disk, just built differently.

11:57
So, the work continues. Wait for new videos.
That’s all. Goodbye, friends!
