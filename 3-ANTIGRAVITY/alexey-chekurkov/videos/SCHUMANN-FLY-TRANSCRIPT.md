Hello, friends! Welcome to Garage Technologies Channel. Today, weâ€™re conducting a fascinating experiment: testing how Schumann resonance frequencies (specifically 20.3 Hz) affect a flyâ€™s ability to navigate a maze.
The Setup

    Frequency Generator: Set to 23 Hz, then tuned to the 3rd harmonic (20.3 Hz)â€”the Schumann resonance linked to Earthâ€™s electromagnetic field.

    Kozyrev Mirrors: These hyperbolic reflectors (named after Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev) allegedly focus "torsion fields" or scalar waves.

    The Maze: A custom-built labyrinth with deceptive dead ends, designed to confuse instinctual navigation.

The Experiment

    A bipolar coil excites the resonator, emitting 20.3 Hz waves into the mirrors.

    A fly is placed inside the maze. Does the frequency alter its decision-making?

Observations

    The fly repeatedly circles the same dead ends, suggesting disorientation.

    Unlike humans, insects lack complex logicâ€”they rely on instinct and environmental cues (like light/airflow).

    At 40:37, the fly finally escapesâ€”but was it luck, persistence, or a subconscious effect of the frequency?

The Science Behind It

    Schumann Resonance (7.83 Hzâ€“33 Hz): Natural frequencies between Earthâ€™s surface and ionosphere, theorized to influence biological rhythms.

    Kozyrev Mirrors: Allegedly amplify "time waves" or consciousness-related fields. Critics dismiss them as pseudoscience.

    Insect Brains: Flies have ~100,000 neurons (vs. humansâ€™ 86 billion). Their navigation is hardwired for survival, not problem-solving.

Broader Implications

    Teslaâ€™s Visions: Nikola Tesla claimed inventions came to him as premonitionsâ€”possibly tapping into an "informational field" of the universe.

    Labyrinths in History: From Creteâ€™s Minotaur myth to Egyptian treasure traps, labyrinths exploit human cognitive biases. This experiment scales it down to insect level.

Ethics Note

No flies were harmed! The subject was released post-trial. Future tests might use mice (markable with dye) for clearer data.
