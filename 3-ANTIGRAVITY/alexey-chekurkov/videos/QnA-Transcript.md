Takeoff and Landing Drive (Answers to Questions)

00:00
Welcome to my channel! My name is still Alexey, and you’re watching "Technology from the Garage."

00:14
First of all, I want to thank everyone who responded to my request and supported the channel. Special thanks to those who donated—your help means a lot to me. Honestly, in the entire history of this channel, only three people have ever just said thank you, so thank you again, friends.

00:41
I also want to apologize for not releasing videos very often or replying to comments right away. My work involves a lot of travel, so I’m rarely at home and it’s hard to find time to sit in the garage and work on my projects. I try to make videos whenever I can, but I can’t upload them as quickly as some people expect—otherwise the content would lose its quality. So if I don’t answer your questions or make videos often, please understand—it’s just work, family, and life getting in the way. Sometimes there are unexpected things, too. I hope you understand.

01:39
When I got back from another work trip, I checked the comments and was honestly shocked at the amount of negativity. People accused me of faking things or claimed I was being exposed. I even saw people linking to other “exposers,” but when I checked, they had the same questions as everyone else. So I decided to make this video to answer your questions once and for all.

02:41
There are 23,000 of you, and many want to meet me in person or chat on Skype or private messages. I’ve said it before: my internet connection is terrible, and even if I use a flash drive, Skype just doesn’t work for me. Sorry, I just can’t chat with everyone online, but I wish I could.

03:17
When we finally get better internet in my area, maybe I’ll be able to join live chats and talk more. For now, I’ll do my best through videos.
Addressing Common Questions

Question 1: Why does the disk fall the way it does?

People ask why my antigravity disk hangs or falls in a certain way, as if I’m supposed to know exactly how all these effects work. Honestly, some of these questions sound a bit childish, especially coming from people who claim to understand physics. Just like a helicopter flies due to differences in air pressure from its rotors, my disk hovers or drops because of similar physical processes. When the drive is disconnected, it falls instantly, just like a bucket of nuts, not gradually. The Hall sensor works the same way—it turns electromagnetic fields on or off, which holds or releases metal objects.

Question 2: Why does the video quality get worse when you raise the camera?

When I lift the camera up towards the sun, the image quality drops. This is just how cameras work—when you move from a shady area to direct sunlight, the camera gets blinded for a second. It’s just the automatic settings struggling, nothing more.

Question 3: Why don’t you film everything up close?

Because of the strong electromagnetic fields, my camera and even my smartphone start to malfunction when I get too close. Even my digital watch stopped working when I tried to measure time next to the device. Only my mechanical watch still works near it. This is a well-known effect—even in TV shows about UFOs, you’ll see electronics stop working when strange things appear.

Question 4: Why doesn’t it shock you when you touch the high-voltage wires?

Good question! The answer is: the way I set up the high-voltage system, the voltage only gets very high inside the drive itself. The wires I’m holding don’t carry the full voltage—they’re safe to touch because of how I distribute the current and voltage through multipliers. Only inside the disk does it reach dangerous levels. If you set up the transformer and multipliers correctly, you can handle the wires without getting shocked. It’s all about engineering.

Question 5: Why don’t the drives lose their magnetization when you leave them?

Because the multipliers keep the charge in the disk for a while. There’s a delay before the charge drops, so the disk hangs for a bit before it starts to fall. I monitor this and connect or disconnect the high voltage at the right time to keep everything working.

Question 6: What’s that crackling or buzzing noise?

Some people hear sounds like fishing line or a reel unwinding. This is just the structure vibrating or parts of the device making noise during operation—totally normal.

Question 7: Why does your shirt move in the wind?

That’s simply because the disk acts a bit like a fan. When the two disks spin and generate a magnetic field, they stir the air and move my shirt. Also, if it’s windy outside, everything sways a bit, including the trees and me.
Final Demo and Conclusions

19:59
Now I’ll show you a demonstration of the levitation drive at home. I’ll drop a ring onto the disk, and you’ll see it levitate—just like last year, using the same setup and place. Whenever I get too close with my phone or digital devices, they stop working because of the strong fields. Some people accuse me of hiding drones, but no, there’s nothing hidden—just two spinning magnetic disks.

23:36
During the experiment, you’ll see that I need to constantly adjust the terminal to keep the ring levitating. If you disconnect the power, it falls slowly—again, nothing magical, just physics.
On Building and Tuning the Device

A lot of people keep asking for diagrams, blueprints, frequencies, and rotational speeds. I promise to share those details in future videos, but preparing all the documentation, diagrams, and theory takes time. The trick with these devices isn’t just building them—it’s tuning them correctly. Even a simple TV tube looks basic, but setting it up to work right is hard.

If you don’t know the theory and how to tune the setup, you won’t get the same effect. I’ll keep working on the best way to explain it so everyone can understand, mixing theory and practical advice.
Research, Inspirations, and Parallels

Some people compare me to Viktor Grebennikov (the Russian scientist who claimed to have built a levitating platform). I’m also inspired by inventors like John Searl and Charles (and yes, even the “Nazi Bell” project). I’m trying out different ideas and combining approaches, studying each direction to find what works best. The more I experiment, the more I notice connections and analogies between all these projects.

I also want to try building Ignatov’s device (a Russian scientist who died under mysterious circumstances and whose gravity device plans were confiscated). There are many interesting stories and directions to explore.
Comments and Thanks

If you want to comment or ask questions, please do! I may not answer right away, but I’ll try. I filter out trolls and spam, but I’m open to real criticism and discussion. Let’s keep it civil.

Thank you again to everyone who supports me. I’ll keep sharing as I learn more. This was Alexey, and you’re watching "Technology from the Garage." See you next time!
