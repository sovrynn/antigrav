Summary in Plain English

Hi everyone, welcome back to the "Technology from the Garage" channel with Alexey. First, thanks so much to everyone supporting the channel and leaving comments—I really appreciate it.

I wanted to talk about something today because I get a lot of comments and questions about my videos. Some people ask why I don’t film close-ups or more panoramic shots, but honestly, I’ve tried both styles and neither one really worked for everyone. So I’m going to aim for something in the middle this time.

I was planning a new video, but I kept getting distracted by new ideas and wasn’t sure if it would be useful to keep making these videos—sometimes it feels like I’m fighting windmills. But I promised to share my thoughts and diagrams about gravity and antigravity, so here it goes.

Today’s video is a bit longer because I want to be thorough, and I’ll include clips from other sources to show I’m not just making things up. I’ll add video proofs to back up my points because, like Igor said, knowledge should be based on facts.
Theories about Gravity and Antigravity

So, what is gravity? Most scientists agree it’s a force that pulls us towards Earth. But there are ways to affect gravity, and I’ve found a few methods:

    Low Temperatures: At very low temperatures, magnets can float, as I’ve shown before.

    Electromagnetic Fields: These can interact with Earth’s gravitational waves.

    Sound Frequencies: The right sound vibrations can affect the weight of objects—think of how the Egyptians might have used sound to help move stones when building pyramids or how Coral Castle in Florida was built.

    Charged Particles: Charging up objects can reduce their weight, which I’ll demonstrate in an experiment.

    Anti-gravity Waves: If you create certain "anti" waves, objects can levitate.

    Frequency Characteristics: Gravity interacts with certain frequencies, so changing those can affect how things behave.

    Neutralizing Gravity Flows: By disrupting gravity "currents," you can reduce weight.

I looked at inventors like John Searl and others who made antigravity devices. Their machines all seemed to have rotating magnetic or electromagnetic fields, often spinning disks or rings. When these spin fast enough, strange things happen, like objects levitating or disappearing, and even radio signals being cut off nearby.
A Bit of History

For example, John Searl as a teenager discovered a new effect using magnets and spinning disks, which eventually led to some wild experiments where objects started to float and even glow. Others, including Russian inventors, tried to replicate this and claimed to build generators that produced free energy without any fuel.

I studied these designs myself and started building my own, using the principles I saw in these earlier devices.
Key Experiments

I’ll show a video where I charge up an object and measure its weight on a scale. When the object is electrically charged, its weight decreases. The effect is small at first, but if you keep charging for longer, it becomes more noticeable.

This principle—using electric charges to reduce weight—can be used to create antigravity devices or help lift heavy objects.
How Does it All Work?

The idea is that a strong enough electromagnetic field, especially if it’s spinning or arranged in a toroid (a donut shape), can "bend" gravity waves around the object, reducing its weight or even making it float. There are also natural places on Earth where gravity behaves strangely, and I think these are related to local electromagnetic anomalies.

When you apply high voltage to these spinning disks, you create fields that interact with gravity. If you add sound waves or ultrasound, you can amplify the effect. The key is to find the right frequencies and synchronize everything.

Some insects, like certain beetles, can also generate these effects with their wings, combining electric charges and sound vibrations to help them fly in mysterious ways.
My Current Design

I’m working on a setup that uses three main parts: a power supply, the main drive with disks, and a low-voltage control section. The idea is to spin two disks in opposite directions, apply high voltage, and use ultrasound to help neutralize gravity.

Magnets are arranged in a certain way to focus the fields, and the material of the disks matters—a lot. Special metals or structures (like what’s found in certain insects) seem to work best.
Final Thoughts

This is all still a work in progress. The principles I’m working with are:

    Electromagnetic fields at certain frequencies can reduce or cancel gravity.

    Interference of waves (like Tesla coils) can push away gravity.

    Fast rotating fields can create lifting forces.

    Sound/ultrasound at the right frequencies can help things levitate.

I know this all sounds a bit wild, but it’s based on experiments and real effects, not just my imagination. If you want to try building something like this yourself, remember that getting the right materials and settings is key. I’m still experimenting, but I wanted to share what I’ve learned so far.

Thanks again to everyone who supports me—especially those who help out financially. My resources are limited, but I’ll keep experimenting and sharing what I find. If you have questions or suggestions, leave a comment. See you next time!

0:07
good time all day with you feed technology with the garage and Alexey above
0:14
just want to thank all those who support to my friends channel you Thanks a lot that do not forget so I
0:25
I want to tell one thing when he read your comments I start something
0:31
disassemble the doubts some asking that I filmed up close more from driving distances to the whole panorama
0:37
was I already removed the two videos and neither that nor another no one liked but need to
0:43
something I think the average shoot so here I
0:49
already wanted to shoot was a new video but then again I came not attacks
0:56
managed to and from paddle that came new and so thought it useless thing I'm fighting with windmills that
1:03
thought I would be doing something that I think I needed you promised to clear gravileta'll diagram
1:09
but I laid out how to say video turn out long because I will
1:15
Insert some videos from other materials that did not think that
1:22
This fantasize something or something to chase them away from myself than so will add video
1:28
videos proving my comments because you know Igor saver and it
1:34
knowledge-based knowledge is based on facts and facts are stubborn things myself in the world
1:41
but everyone knows I thought with this Admit it so here I want to tell you too
1:49
the theory along the way somehow schema level 55 quick! and its reasoning their reasoning will be
1:58
to confirm these facts from other commercials but I understand that all doubt because doubt is an indication that you
2:05
make friends with the reality I did not blame I understand that it is too good
2:11
to be true so you need to their words to be proved and today's video
2:18
slightly delayed because it will long did not immediately tell everyone there so
2:24
that is not interesting to anyone can fast rewound when scrolling there will reach schemes but to understand the whole principle of need
2:31
listen while my reasoning I will today will try as much as possible
2:38
describe in detail the theory and from the This process of research which I
2:45
did last time so here's Please be patient and start
3:01
So what is primarily gravity itself many
3:08
scientists are trying to explain this principle This phenomenon their as stated theories
3:14
It's just you can express and two words gravity is the force which us
3:20
draws to the land that's all how it is expressed in different in one
3:26
the process that pulls us all I have several ways to affect her this
3:32
you know how low temperatures as I already had one of its video showed as low temperatures hovering magnet then
3:40
the second is a particular electromagnetic fields affect the gravitational waves of the Earth and
3:46
3 correctly selected frequency sound Oscillation influences on weight of items
3:52
It has been proven since ancient times when the Egyptians were building their
4:00
the pyramid they created sound waves giant bells items changed
4:06
weight well you probably know about Coral Castle that weighs not
4:13
several Tory blocks on poveshali several tons and built it one person but this mystery but not with you grave
4:20
principle, it is clear that he did with the help of sound vibrations facilitate these blocks and
4:27
Castle of gathered and the fourth way charged particles lose items
4:35
weight is already an experiment I'll then demonstrated in one later
4:43
anti-establishment wave 5 too if you create anti wave and gravity also happens
4:49
effect of levitation 6 the dimension frequency characteristics of the subject
4:56
as we know that gravity interaction frequency and 7 neutralization
5:02
gravity flows we here consider a few of those principles here is a start I
5:08
duck the review all this I revised design of already known
5:14
inventors such as Shaw Robert gray Charles and I saw what I saw analogy of the physical principles of their
5:22
apparatus namely that they have 25 x 25 almost identical nature itself
5:30
the fact that they rotate radial magnetic or electromagnetic fields here
5:37
even know the third Bell project Reich also rotates two cylinders that shows Berg
5:45
Returns the two-disc in the draft Bell 2 cylinders what effect such and
5:51
so let's start
6:02
stopped history of Charlie Searle I liked this interesting
6:10
thing they have basically the same principle but somehow many confused Charlie
6:16
Russell says that it is one and the same man no guys John Charles has already died and John Searle still
6:22
live as that's where it all started here in age 14 years Charlie entered apprentice
6:28
an electrician at the plant in English the city of Birmingham working with permanent magnets for
6:34
electricity meters in 1946, he opened a new effect electromechanics and it was such a rapidly
6:44
Rotary drives appears radial the driving force behind the vertical vector to increase this force first
6:51
is magnetized disks and then became use permanent magnets so here's a few rings such as Searle
7:00
It was up to and that's the ball and then one day it
7:07
model consisting of several United together rings experienced in the yard already at low revs in
7:13
radial direction rings appeared a large potential difference that influenced by the nature and cod electric charges and the smell of ozone and
7:21
then happened quite unusually block He pulled away and motor raskruchivaeshsja
7:26
rings hung at a height of 1.5 meters continuously increased turnovers as rotation around
7:33
the object appeared rosy glow Air revitalization and with thumbs down pressure started to object
7:41
climb but here's another side the effect was that around Radio stopped and turned
7:49
radio receivers finally rotation reached to such a fantastic the speed that the object quickly disappeared from
7:56
mind so inspired by their results from 52 of the year ball 52
8:02
was created called by over 10 models and levitirujushhih discs in later learned to control dispersal
8:10
such disks see here It is necessary to remember this important point
8:17
that in a rapidly rotating radial
8:23
electromotive force appears discs with vertical vector here is the need to just remember this effect used
8:30
and shower Berg look at his Charles design is basically one of them
8:36
and the same principle but a little difference between the poison did not see what
8:42
Prince Charles the design itself but the ball Bergamo then now consider I ate
8:48
principle and collected my drive so here's
8:54
80-IES and Charlene has been a lot of noise in the press as the father on the flying saucers but then as if he enrolled from someone
9:01
new teams and all the talk instantly stopped and then he
9:07
just died here still want to add that two Russian Muscovite here Vladimir valleys and Serge Godin are aiming to
9:15
check out the opening of John Charles they went to him and took the interview him continue in prison but he flatly
9:23
refused to extradite its secret but they are not surrendered and its already being said
9:29
built by others went and built your way free energy generator
9:36
He, too, weighing in at 350 kilograms he issued 10 kilowatts of electricity not
9:42
consuming fuel and he same fits in the forest when he is already turned okay I will not further
9:50
jump in the history of the return to your drive how I started doing I revised the shaur
9:59
Berga Searle and started doing here occurs q: what physical properties creates
10:07
This device that makes him levitate first What comes to mind is how the analogy with 3
10:15
cell capacitor which means that These plates must upon filing
10:21
charge voltage and here I wanted to show one the device that caught me once
10:30
experiment with How to behave in the body charged particles now here I am you
10:37
demonstrate one video that he worth a look this video will show you
10:44
that charged the body loses weight and so Let's see now as
10:59
separated ment means serves as a radiation line
11:05
saturation of the sample mean fluid are glass of lyrics
11:12
balanced laboratory scales by using
11:18
Electra shape machine I'm going significantly protect the electromagnetic colleague or mean static
11:25
electronic no energy this sample and We see his behavior in the mountain birds
11:31
He'll field [applause]
11:44
from there do not escape
12:45
but because it was temporarily effect on the sample of this opinion not so significant if more
12:52
prolonged exposure to this sample refer to the sample becomes easier on
13:00
a more substantial amount that is, suppose you show on
13:06
time here is now in the West for a long time to show that depending on
13:12
time charge builds up more essential for creating such
13:19
gravitational field that face
13:37
so this is enough no more than that is, it can be seen that Rick mourning machine
13:46
given far enough and you can see that show how much time has passed now time that is here is often the fix here
13:57
This sample exercise your anti-gravity the properties of the gravitational field of the Earth more essentially that is already here are markedly
14:07
that is, if the sample data charging solid aggregate condition
14:15
charge builds up even more extent, i.e. density charge on how whip to a greater extent and accordingly
14:25
given this mean this principle can be used in flying
14:31
apparatus for lifting cargo movement in an atmosphere and in space the people you
14:37
watched now and make the output from the video it is clear that he jelektrizovannye the body loses weight electromagnetic fields
14:46
the surrounding body partially influenced gravity but this is not enough because you want to body
14:54
force to levitate a electromagnetic field with a circulating
15:01
closed the thread then gravity waves will bend around it going forward, and will tell you that there are
15:10
such moments, something like this even in the scattered across the Earth
15:17
anomalous zone as you probably know How about the area about Lake where for example gravity is bent the same too
15:25
you create these electromagnetic anomalies and the earth itself that's well if you want to then reach and
15:34
Why create this drives power the effect of the fact that when applying high the tension on the drive they are recharged
15:41
creating How would form around and fields
15:48
mechanical rotation of the disc causes This field study in toroidal dates closed Vortex so that you do not have
15:57
the whirlwind they from you have different potential According to serve a minus on the bottom and plus
16:03
on top of that they are not scattered here I used this medium disk
16:10
submitted to it by the voltage from Kacharava on a pulsating 2 2 paths that before were
16:16
resistant and magnets that are They both enhances this effect here
16:24
well that's when submitting high-frequency pulses of downloading tried thus gleaned frequency when
16:34
which of these 2 dani how would tighten one another they created 2 dash
16:41
Vortex and that's worth mentioning even grebennikov also told that he flies on
16:47
bublikah that is the same 2 (d) toroidal vikhrev who created the the apparatus but only already the other way he
16:55
have already used another effect although sense the other design was but the effect
17:01
was used the same ogovorochka Lo and behold stealthily to the importance of momentum
17:09
on the boat and thus forced flashing these fields at frequencies at
17:15
which deviates by gravitational waves here for example take insects they
17:21
create such electric fields around his body take a look at the u
17:30
insect distribution charges in it and the distribution charges around
17:37
the globe now here is cause for screen picture and consider it more
17:44
a closer look at what we're seeing is the same 3-way asymmetric capacitor that is
17:50
three-piece asymmetric capacitor morning watch the same beetle body
17:56
plate that and with these drives ball Berga they have the same principle of flight they
18:03
create these games anti-gravity cocoons that they said praised
18:11
but that's still worth bent mention that They also use electricity and beetles
18:20
coupled with these with sound waves well beetles
18:30
creates the effect of levitation due to sets the sound vibrations and electrostatic charging your body
18:37
Here is the same principle used and shear apparatus Berga liver system that levitiroval for vector
18:46
Woodcocks creating rotating disks Here is this diagram indicated that, engine
18:53
consists of screws as the helicopter actually this misinformation show Burke considered a spiral thrust yesterday
19:01
hopeless idea for high-speed aircraft flying He suggested that the plates instead of screws
19:08
install special membranes thin metal plates which driven by electromagnets
19:14
the engine was created by on the principle the phone speaker and therefore form the first flying devices acquired views
19:22
disks and beetles Nan opened as creating them vibrations
19:28
but in principle effect produces one and the same but different ways but
19:35
only that their United here is to know and not some so the analogy between a if you take and assume the device balloon
19:42
Berg and beetle still viewed taxes so there are
19:51
For example sound waves electron magnetic fields that is, these waves create the effect of this
20:00
the effect of repeated as well, take video now he look and remember 1 thing
20:06
He worked the same combination waves from the transformer and Tesla
20:16
the sound vibration to them the aggregates but still spolzoval This product van den graph now and
20:24
Now this video we made Another conclusion Britta till John though
20:30
the clock in the ambiguity of the notion of gravity have long and repeatedly
20:36
again enthusiasts experimenters so learning longitudinal waves, Tesla and simultaneously using high-voltage generator
20:43
Wanda graph back in 1979 year Canadian physics inventor John Hutcherson has become
20:50
witness a new, unknown science the phenomenon of quick reference high voltage generator of Wanda
20:56
graph generates a voltage up to seven million Volt the principle of operation is based on electrization
21:03
moving dielectric tape This current turns out to be disproportionately little and touch the generator you can even
21:10
children longitudinal waves interference created by two or more coils Tesla forced 32 kilo kernel
21:18
levitate and ice cream cups wrenches and other dribs and drabs sent to the ceiling
21:24
metals and wood and heterogeneous materials metal floated down the river or heated to melting temperature and
21:31
fire and massive steel rods spontaneously exploded like paper
21:37
surviving videos documentary records look so convincingly that borders in the Paranormal we now
21:44
the result of one of the experiments carried out in his garage inventor John regulates the frequency
21:50
electromagnetic radiation aimed to arbitrarily chosen objects though the hour didn't hide that much of what
21:57
It was found the wife was a continuation of experiments, Nicola Tesla available works which he carefully considered but what could
22:05
get through experiments exceeded all expectations and has limits of existing views on the
22:12
the nature of gravity and space time
22:18
After sirla many experimenters enthusiasts independently came to the conclusion
22:24
electromagnetic field of certain frequencies can cause the status when where there is no gravity and matter
22:31
time and space are changing their characteristics and so summarize total
22:38
the foregoing clearly visible four basic principles and all as
22:47
You can see it is not my imagination and mind oil on the specific effects of open and
22:53
confirmed real in people such like Charlize sure I'll show Berg and so
23:01
the first is the electromagnetic field a certain frequency can produce State in which gravity
23:09
There is no second interference and longitudinal waves creating my two or more Tesla coils
23:17
rejects the gravitational waves the third fast rotating radial field appears
23:25
radial force with a vertical vector 4 vibration correctly
23:32
selected purity make items levitate so here are all these These principles and lie at the heart
23:40
plundered the country but I didn't mention such effects still like dogs lattice
23:46
structures such as Graphene and stuff but It's already a topic for another discussion is not will take all the conductivity at low
23:55
temperatures this effect too is present but it laborious so less complex
24:04
inconvenient for us to remember all these four principle of them will start and
24:11
so now the most interesting turn the police flight take a look at the diagram I
24:18
now tell everyone how Finally you wait I promised I diagram
24:24
in this video today and lay so look the diagram
24:30
but here's the friends scheme itself as promised This we show so here is what we
24:39
Here we can see it consists of 3 parts of this pulsed power and couture itself part
24:46
low voltage now consider all of a point that what you want well power
24:53
part of us is used to supply from these two drives for high davaniju Here we see the voltage itself this
25:02
regulator with power block as there We have the voltage regulator itself
25:09
then there is the power scheme was tdks NIKA but it may be another I decided not
25:16
bother could do Yuna assemble the push-pull on 2-x colors I don't
25:22
become a bother stuck simple santexnik goes on and multiplier but multipliers parade
25:29
collected under the bottom mounted the disk under the bottom parts so
25:38
What this gives us is it gives us a voltage plus minus at the top is served on the lower
25:44
This is due to the fact that we charge the Earth distributed so the Earth has
25:50
negative charge that is negative and I us sphere positively positive we know that the minus from minus repelled
25:57
so here it goes-minus from the Earth and here is how it would
26:08
the logic to that of magnets but here truth is not repulsion of magnets is another effect now explain why we nuzhet
26:16
Couture couture us sets themselves are downloaded that loan and us impulse issues here
26:23
the transformer itself but if we put back the wire pulses will go via the Middle the drive gives us something when
26:30
Hotel spin motors and we serve high voltage on them that we
26:37
gives we get two toroidal whirlwinds they twist in different directions
26:44
This couture at week average drive He did not give the swirl neutralize
26:50
see each other we have potential positively negative here they are each other can neutralize
26:57
the impulses they issue them permanently momentum on the schema of this issues will gives when that effect is something those 2
27:05
up to 2 toroidal games they do not disintegrate further what is this
27:11
Ultrasound part here we will see battery regulator itself and also regulator and
27:19
This ultrasonic generator as saw the video showed that qualitatively
27:25
sent items and longitudinal waves levitirovali objects but they were waves
27:31
high purity I didn't bother to pick up longitudinal waves I have go a boost from
27:37
boats but high-frequency waves are coming from This ultrasonic generator itself
27:43
It is worth pezojelement It is located in the upper part of the drive itself diagram of the little it is small
27:49
She fits this bird caps all regulators handed down to I need so
27:55
that and one low-voltage I have here goes with this schema, one wire
28:01
but four cable he nourishes themselves motors and here's this scheme They then distributed the voltage at
28:09
ultrasonic generator and motors so Here we see the motors spin disks in
28:15
different parties as well as from the system shaur Berg but it slightly differently were he that is
28:22
the disk itself is the same electro form machine launched horizontally but ball Berga was here
28:29
two longitudinal brushes they stood starred charges transformations and shared
28:35
on electronic machines from itself positrons that it too would be Yes as arber has been charging
28:43
charges and positrons Positron charges have body charged Positron us
28:50
properties to levitate but how do you remember from the clip that loaded the body is just even the electrons also has property
28:58
lose weight that gives meaning gravitational wave Earth Flex here
29:05
so here's a look at the system itself drives disperse these kids drive motor
29:14
two-disc creates a toroidal Vortex 2 the average Indian does not give the fray
29:22
There are neutralized and gravitationally wave bends around it and what not gravitational waves is a simple stream
29:28
that pushes it has more density in spite of the fact that he did not feel rather say yes more
29:36
density and therefore all our planet round that they caught a monstrous pressure
29:42
that's why you haven't noticed the planet round same explained his theory videos antigravity because their poisonous
29:49
compresses the stream and all bodies that any body which has less density compressed in one direction is pressed in
29:58
toward the less you and density is logically, therefore, the nature of gravitation in this way, and can be explained and so
30:07
Here's what that body if not pressed further works classic law centrifugal movement that is further
30:14
all of the classics the centrifugal force of the Earth throw out here is the body of yourself away with this clear further proceed to the
30:25
We have magnets they are located here so why not 6 magnets 6 4
30:32
8 No No 9 and that's really all that moaning and if hold this EPG will turn out as though SATA chillin on esata to remember
30:39
grebennikov said wave my these height to emit if you arrange them
30:45
Here are these lines how would happen here So how will they field Chamomile is distributed will turn out as we would
30:53
also not wave the lighthouse and here
30:59
electromagnet in this field focus it behind as you can see
31:06
How are it North-up magnets South of and below the voltage to
31:13
sub-zero South here it creates the effect of
31:20
I really can't explain fully all because he is not yet up to the end of all I understand but I explain all how can so
31:28
that's why ask me beforehand not to scold If something does not explain what I
31:34
explain at the level at which unavailable so can of course disagrees with
31:42
my opinion of the new express their the point of view of what we serve is morning sound scheme, quality remember
31:50
experimented with longitudinal waves He sent the transducer head subjects and objects of levitirovali nose
31:57
These radiators have him as mentioned roller with to high frequency impulses gave
32:05
they were directed at the object and subject How do you say change my frequency
32:11
characteristics and it gave property levitate I have as you can see here
32:18
collected all the heap I go somehow difficult way want to sure the system itself
32:24
This is not a game, this price can be much easier because in the medal zone there to take and
32:30
No complex electronics aren't there just some anomaly associated with these earth crust
32:37
well this heater pejzo the limit is worth myself English assembled it
32:43
issues like ultrasound on all this system This irradiates his
32:49
high frequencies of all this apparatus Couture gives an impulse too
32:55
high frequency somewhere with them must be catch the resonance How to configure and here already begins with
33:03
whole hemorrhoids you guys who had to deal with These parabolic antennas know
33:10
What should be there and doing polarization horizontal vertical Customize sang transponder
33:16
and all the stuff here too, not less crap even husband more need to reconcile these purity
33:23
Pulse downloaded on average drives These steroids asking them voltage
33:30
by adjusting the adjusting magnetization These discs because it is as see having this spider become an entity
33:39
the capacitor is charging if the charge be above and either less schema options
33:45
filled up and it's gravitational waves they no longer skirts passes carry
33:53
7 pridavlju if they are configured as would synchronously to it
33:59
These resonance fields was the gravitational waves as though skirts this the schema itself and here is these effects that
34:08
an all this electronic fans gives us here is the gravitational
34:14
action well here I say food
34:20
in some complicated way Oh and this scheme worth and meaning to collect if you have here
34:26
This metal with which collected those disks they both remember this grebennikova
34:33
and in the video also said atera that he opened OK, he has a rough structure it rough these bumps
34:40
they are in electrization they bend these magnet
34:47
magnetic fields and when here is жук flies he Maha is remembered as he wings over the wing and wing flap this
34:55
mahaniem it produces electrostatic pulses which saturates over the wing and there opened
35:02
whales as my video you have seen already There are still heaps of many such
35:08
holes here are these and more from the bottom How would such hairs here on these
35:15
hairs flowing charges but I've because this system is a little different here
35:21
he copied these disc two of this metal they are very closely resemble the structure of this beetle and
35:29
boost sets not the wing which waving this couture which delivers
35:37
It pulses how would Alex electrostatic pulse and it plus these sound and ultrasound
35:43
wave is and this whole system together here
35:49
This gives the effect of which the Earth's gravitational field bends around it all well as you realize that there is a sense
35:58
collect all when you have such a metal but don't worry I have already
36:04
began collecting the new drive as you can see Here is a simple metal no this not from
36:13
order metal with which collected the TU concentration of ordinary buildings dividends but here are two magnetic field
36:20
distribution of fields I want to pick up Here are the specs for this drive if
36:27
be able to start then you will already be easier to collect it so far I've yet to go to trial
36:36
stage of development until we return to this scheme so that
36:43
diagram I posted I don't know if you have the desire to collect or not passed of course
36:49
consider one that I take no liability if you failed If suddenly you haven't found such metal is not
36:56
picked up options There is no reason to as stated on on it
37:02
need to know some things and here's how Configure the settings here are already subject to
37:08
another video on this I think finish hope was wondering I still
37:17
get back to the topic of grebennikova grebi gravilet and already I've started to collect then I saw seemed to worked with the archive
37:24
grebennikov so I run if Dean in all directions my something will tell and
37:31
then another from such inventions as
37:38
Ignatov you probably have not heard of such ignat, he too and for Brad invent levitating device but it in another
37:46
the principle was but it was very simple, I then it's already continue to next
37:52
saw the sydney video existed and so I think probably you don't have the patience
37:58
beyond the main watch you recounted some of the principle itself must understand told as I could to
38:07
the level of kicking I understand well hope It was interesting to here so ask questions
38:15
write comments who are interested place the Huskies-dizlajki now I'm listening to
38:21
often feel again on me posypetsja shit from all crevices cars full of trolls
38:28
We will not be distracted them okay This is my friends good luck
38:34
Once again I want to thank those who helped me with finances and my friends thank you Thank you
38:40
you helped me a lot so I have money is limited and well research
38:48
I'll continue to run here is This disc it will see on design
38:54
it easier metal easier material simple I I guess I hope someday and pick up
39:05
settings for it in the meantime, good luck with you was Alexey channel technology with garage
