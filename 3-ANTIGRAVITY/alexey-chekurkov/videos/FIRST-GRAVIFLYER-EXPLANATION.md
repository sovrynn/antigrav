Hello again, everyone. This is the channel Technology from the Garage with Alexey. Today I’ll answer the questions that have been troubling you.

0:12
First of all, this video is made especially for the user with the nickname… one moment… ot sayt CNC. Sorry, my friend, you didn’t introduce yourself, so I don’t know your real name, but that’s what I understood your channel is called. So, this is for you and your questions.

0:40
Let me start by saying: “No good deed goes unpunished.” Judging by the comments, people have already begun to throw stones at me. But your questions, as they say, “make you doubt.” Now I’ll explain a little.

1:06
The main thing that bothers you: “What’s that fishing line hanging there?” Guys, that’s not fishing line—it’s a wire. It runs from the Kacher oscillator to the middle disk. I’ll reveal this secret to you so that there are no accusations. Of course, I won’t reveal everything, only part of the information.

You also asked about the shadow. Yes, you see a shadow from the device, and also mine. I was adjusting the field intensities on the disks. Next to them was the Kacher. As you know, the Kacher produces pulsed voltage on its secondary coil. I was tuning it with the middle disk. That’s why my shadow is there.

2:22
Someone also asked why I set the camera and walked away. I put the camera there for convenience, then went to adjust the settings. Because, as you say, “cans can’t fly.” Yes, of course, they won’t fly without special adjustments.

This is an extremely complex device. No one online has attempted to build something similar properly, and those who did got nothing because they didn’t even know the correct assembly algorithm. It’s complicated, and not guaranteed to work. And yet—yes, I showed what you call a “tin can” lifting weight with about 20,000 volts of high voltage.

3:15
Colleague, I agree: ordinary cans can’t fly. But if you create the right conditions, they can. The cans themselves mean nothing. The entire setup—wires, circuitry—creates the effect.

Again: that’s not fishing line, it’s a wire from the Kacher. I’d intended to keep it secret, but I had to tell you to stop the accusations.

3:50
If you try building something like this, you have to at least know what you’re doing. Theory without practice is blind, and practice without theory is foolish. I fought with this stuff for 20 years. I studied the works of Searl, Grebennikov, and Charle. The technology here uses Charle’s principles—you may know Roshchin and Godin, who also studied his levitating disks. The key in all of them is a rotating magnetic field creating antigravity. But there are nuances I haven’t revealed.

Experiments like this are dangerous. In our country, they can be punished. Remember what happened to Roshchin and Godin when they made their generator? Their lab was destroyed. Charle himself was jailed for his experiments. And Viktor Grebennikov—I believe he was killed. He spoke a little, then fell silent, because special services warned him not to bring the technology into reality. His book My World had many key pages removed about the device, replaced with filler about beetles and butterflies.

5:58
So yes, “cans can fly,” but not by themselves. Setting up the fields is key. That’s why you see cuts in the video: I was filming for two hours trying to tune the fields. That’s why there’s editing, why you see my shadow, why the Kacher is visible.

And yes, Grebennikov was right not to reveal everything—because people won’t believe anyway. They’ll say you’re a trickster. Funny thing: you believe Grebennikov’s platform flew, though you never saw it. But you see my device with your own eyes, and you don’t believe it. Strange, isn’t it?

8:00
You mocked my use of “cans.” But look closer: this corrugated aluminum is crucial. It acts like insect wing covers—Grebennikov described their structure creating resonance. The corrugation serves as a resonator.

9:49
So yes, anyone can rivet cans together, but making them fly takes much more. I didn’t reveal everything in the video. You’re right: you’d have to be a fool to share the full technology openly. I haven’t told you everything. Without certain details, you won’t be able to repeat it.

If I can’t patent it, then I’ll publish the full information online. Maybe even sell units if I build them. The first step is done—I got lift. Next is making stable vertical flight, then horizontal flight. That’s more complicated, because all the electronics and avionics have to be packed into the disk.

11:16
Some of you wanted me on Skype. Okay, when I’m on vacation, I’ll contact you from an internet café. People like Sergey Piston and ot sayt CNC—I’ll connect with you when possible.

As for accusations of strings: no, it’s not on fishing line or wire supports. The only thing I regret is not waving a mop over the device in the video to prove it wasn’t hanging. Unfortunately, after posting the video online, my device was stolen. But whoever took it won’t get it working—they don’t know how to tune the Kacher at the right frequency.

12:25
I used a Kacher design from the internet, one with a variable resistor to control streamer power. I even built two versions with different transistors—on one, the device didn’t work, but on the other it did. This shows how many nuances there are.

So yes, you can rivet cans together, but without tuning the fields correctly to create a counter-wave to gravity, you won’t get anything. That’s the real reason they flew. I didn’t reveal one small secret. Understand: you wouldn’t reveal everything either, if you had such technology.

15:00
I’ll say honestly, I doubt anyone online can help me—too much nonsense out there, lots of fake “theories.” I’m an engineer myself, not the greatest, but I’ve worked seriously on this. I studied Grebennikov, Charle, Searl. I also want to try the Nazi “Bell” project. Look it up—there’s information online. I might attempt to build it.

15:57
About voltage: from the flyback transformer (TДКС), the output is DC because it has a built-in multiplier and diodes. By the spark gap length, it’s about 10 kV. I mentioned this in another video, maybe you missed it.

16:39
I also already explained my method of “pandemotor construction”—designing while in a subconscious, intuitive state. Tesla used something similar.

17:01
Here’s an interesting anecdote: while experimenting, my neighbor told me her chair moved strangely and a pen lifted into the air—exactly when I was adjusting my fields. That made me review my logs and notice a pattern.

So yes, I’m still working on Grebennikov’s platform but haven’t finished. I just returned from a business trip, saw your comments, and was shocked at the attacks. I’ll continue when I have time.

18:20
That’s it for now. If you have more questions, leave them in the comments—I’ll answer. Goodbye, good luck to all. Likes don’t matter, but I’d be happy to hear your comments.
