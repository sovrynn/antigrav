Hello, dear friends! You're watching Garage Technologies Channel, and today’s video is all about the search for free energy.
The Quest Begins

I’ve wanted to make this video since 2015, back when I first started this channel. Today, I’m in a remote location—a beautiful lakeside spot, far from power lines, cell towers, or any artificial interference. The goal? To test if "free energy" can be harvested from the environment using Tesla-inspired technology.
The Theory

Our atmosphere is saturated with natural and man-made energy:

    Solar radiation (alpha/beta particles, gamma rays, photons).

    Radio waves (FM, TV, mobile signals, GPS).

    Earth’s electric field (ionosphere = + charge, ground = – charge).

Tesla believed this "ocean of energy" could be tapped—no power plants, no wires, just antennas and clever circuits.
The Experiments
1. Basic Tesla Setup

    Device: Aluminum sheet (antenna) + variable capacitor + ground rod (in moist soil).

    Result: Tiny voltage spike (0.07V), but not enough to be useful.

2. Upgraded Tesla Coil + Diode Bridge

    Device: Handmade Tesla coil + 4 diodes/capacitors (no batteries!).

    Result: 1.35V–2V measured! The capacitors slowly charge from ambient RF waves.

    Proof: A battery-less digital clock runs solely on harvested energy (see video for live demo!).

3. Parabolic Reflector Antenna

    Goal: Capture wider frequency ranges (longer wavelengths = more energy).

    Problem: Rain started, disrupting measurements. (Nature 1 – Science 0.)

4. Grebennikov-Inspired Hexagonal Coil

    Design: Tesla coil wound on a hexagonal core (to amplify "de Broglie waves").

    Result: Similar ~1.5V output, but weather interference skewed data.

Key Takeaways

✅ Free energy exists—but in minuscule amounts with simple setups.
✅ Earth’s electric field is a potential goldmine (millions of volts, if you can reach the ionosphere!).
❌ Weather matters: Rain = poor conductivity. Sunny days = better results.
Next Steps

Can we scale this to power a 220V lightbulb in the wild? That’s the next video! We’ll need:

    Larger antennas (balloons? Towers?).

    Voltage multipliers (to boost tiny currents).

    Better grounding (maybe a saltwater pit?).

🔹 Final Thought
Tesla’s dream isn’t dead—it’s just waiting for the right circuit. As he said:
"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration."
