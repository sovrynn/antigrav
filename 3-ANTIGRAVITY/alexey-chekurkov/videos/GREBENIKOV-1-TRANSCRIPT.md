Hello YouTube, good day to everyone.
It’s me again, the Technology from the Garage channel.
I’m your host, Alexey.

Judging by the photos, you’ve probably already guessed that this will be a review of Grebennikov’s “gravitational platform.”
This subject interests many people, and it interests me as well.
Many try to uncover the secret of his platform.

I did some research, came to some conclusions, and I want to share them with you.
So, let’s begin.

0:35
Here is Grebennikov’s platform, and let’s look at it more constructively.

He himself claimed that he really did fly on it, though many doubt it’s possible.
As I said in earlier reviews, this topic was published in the Technology for Youth magazine.
That was a serious magazine—they wouldn’t publish nonsense.
So most likely, the subject had some basis.

Here’s the schematic sketch of his graviplatform.
As you see, structurally, there’s nothing too complicated:
two folding boards, a stand, an altimeter showing height, handlebars from a motorcycle or moped, some control buttons, rods, and supports.

The design is fairly simple—no super-advanced electronics.

1:49
I came to this conclusion: Viktor Stepanovich (Grebennikov) wasn’t a great scientist or super-genius in electronics.
So his device shouldn’t have been too complex—it had to be very simple.

His childhood was during the war, his youth in camps.
He couldn’t get a good formal education.
He was more of a self-taught experimenter.

Nevertheless, he achieved significant results.

So, his platform likely consisted of just two boards, a stand, a few simple mechanisms, minimal electrical parts—mostly mechanical.

2:49
Back to his discovery: in 1988, while studying insect wing covers, he noticed a strange effect.
When he placed one on top of another, they wouldn’t stay together—they repelled.
That phenomenon intrigued him.

He studied it further and described it in his book My World.

What he discovered is known as the “CSE effect” (Cavity Structural Effect).
The wing covers had microscopic stamped structures, like tiny cells.
He himself couldn’t reproduce those patterns artificially—they required precision machinery.

So, he used the natural wing covers.
He glued several together, creating blocks.

He noticed they could even hold a paperclip in mid-air in a certain arrangement.
If reversed, they repelled each other.
This led him to think they created an anti-gravity effect.

4:45
When assembled in blocks, the structure seemed to strengthen “de Broglie waves,” which influenced gravity.
Stacked one way—they lifted objects above them.
Stacked the other way—they repelled each other.

He also described an invisible energy “cocoon” forming around these structures.
Waves seemed to bend around it.

So, I believe he glued several such chitin blocks onto his platform.

5:48
But just lifting wasn’t enough—he needed control: altitude, horizontal movement, left-right, etc.

That’s where the handlebars, buttons, and levers came in.
They probably adjusted the angle or opening of the wing blocks—like shutters or blinds.
By tilting or shifting them slightly, he could change direction.

This might explain how he maneuvered.

7:11
This principle resembles the Biefeld-Brown effect (electrogravitics):
large capacitor plates, thin wires—like insect wings vibrating, creating electrostatic forces.

Supporting this: Grebennikov wrote his platform wouldn’t fly in rain or damp weather.
And indeed, insects also don’t fly in wet weather.
Why? Because the electrostatic effect disappears in moisture.

Even a small battery could generate the required electrostatic charge.
Not much energy was needed—just enough to trigger the effect.

9:31
But here’s where my doubts arise.
Looking at the photos of him “flying,” the shadows don’t match.
The angles of the sun and shadows are inconsistent.
That suggests the photos may have been faked.

I don’t want to tarnish his name, but it raises questions.

10:33
Still, I think the principle of his graviplatform involved beetle wing covers.
He didn’t publicly admit this—probably so people wouldn’t start hunting insects and ripping off their wings to build platforms.

In his book, he drops hints about a specific beetle species, a kind of “smooth beetle” found in Central Asia and Siberia.
He described how it felt like it was being pulled upward when held.
That was his clue.

The intricate microstructure of the wings couldn’t be manufactured easily.
So he simply used the natural material.

13:10
The wing panels were assembled into blocks, forming something like adjustable shutters.
By controlling their angles and spacing, he could regulate altitude and maybe even horizontal flight.

But this would require further experiments—which take time and money.
I don’t have enough of either.

So, for now, I can only share the reasoning and analysis I’ve managed.

15:43
I want to stress: these are just hypotheses.
I don’t claim absolute truth.

But analyzing his book, photographs, and descriptions, I came to these conclusions.
You may agree or disagree—it’s up to you.

That’s where I’ll end this video.
Likes are optional, but comments are very important to me—even critical ones.

Thanks everyone!
This was Alexey, Technology from the Garage.
Bye-bye!
