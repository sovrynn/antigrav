Hello, YouTube. Good day to everyone,
0:04
this is Alexey and the channel Technology from the Garage. My last

video about flying saucers drew a lot of interest and many questions. And

many subscribers weren’t satisfied with the

answers I gave last time.

So, today after returning from a business trip and

reading the comments, I realized that I need to give you more information
0:19
about my latest work. Well,
0:21
let’s begin.

I’ve been studying antigravity for a long time and was very interested in it. I dug up some things online, some I learned from other sources. But the information is scattered in bits and pieces, so I had to collect it over several years.

First, I want to say that my Skype connection is terrible, my internet speed is very poor, so it’s impossible to talk there. When I turn on the camera, it lags badly. Even with my mother, I can’t talk properly on Skype. We switch to phone calls.

Now, to the point. Many subscribers, like Sergey Piston and the CNC site, were very interested in details about the disk. Since I can’t explain via Skype, I have to make videos like this.

When I returned from my business trip, my wife told me shocking news: my garage had been broken into and the disk was stolen. Before that, I’d been receiving calls—someone was very interested in these developments. I don’t know if it’s connected, but the fact is—the disk and equipment were stolen, along with some of my notes on the “gravitoplane.”

By the way, I also work on developments of Viktor Stepanovich Grebennikov, starting to create a graviplane. This block of the panel is just an early prototype.

Now, back to the disk, since that’s what most of you are interested in. To be honest, I didn’t invent anything new. I simply replicated old designs, first known as far back as 1922. That year, the first launch of such a device was carried out—by German engineers or, more precisely, by mediums. They took esoteric sciences seriously, used mediums to connect to “information streams of the cosmos,” and received antigravity device concepts. One of those devices I replicated.

At first, it didn’t work. I experimented based on the works of Searl and Schauberger. They discovered that in a rotating magnetic flow, a lift vector arises. Many of their developments were based on this, as was mine.

Here you see a three-section capacitor. Essentially, all those UFO-like saucer-shaped designs are asymmetric flying capacitors. They create an asymmetric magnetic field, producing thrust as the aether flows around them, and the craft is pushed up by Earth’s centrifugal force.

My design had stationary and counter-rotating disks with magnets. Power was supplied by a flyback transformer (TVS). From its voltage, about 8–10 kV, the system was powered. Two motors spun the disks in opposite directions, but I never measured the exact RPMs.

The third disk wasn’t just for convenience—it also acted like a capacitor plate, enhancing the field. The magnets were arranged north–south around the disk’s edge, altering the magnetic field structure. The idea was to resonate with Earth’s magnetic field.

Honestly, I don’t claim to fully understand the design. Like Tesla, who admitted he only “received” ideas from some higher source, I also practiced a kind of subconscious “constructive meditation.” I relaxed, let my subconscious connect, and ideas came through—like how beavers build dams perfectly without engineering school. That’s how I assembled my disk.

The first three attempts failed, but by the fourth, the disk began losing weight on scales, and by the fifth version, it worked. The final disk used steel and aluminum parts. The aluminum piece had a rough surface, similar to insect wing covers that Grebennikov described in his book My World.

Grebennikov discovered structural cavities in insect wing cases that had antigravity effects. His “graviplane” was based on this. In Tekhnika Molodezhi magazine (1993), photos of his device were published—it was serious enough to consider authentic. He left hints in his book, like describing how certain beetles, when sitting on a finger, seemed to pull upward. He noted only one insect type had this property—a Siberian beetle. His panels were made from their wing covers, creating a porous asymmetric capacitor structure.

Similarly, my disk acted like an asymmetric capacitor. Instead of producing ionic wind, it interacted with the aether and Earth’s gravity field. At certain voltages and rotation speeds, a short-lived antigravity effect appeared. Unfortunately, I never finished testing—it was stolen.

Some skeptics say it was just hanging on threads. I don’t care to prove anything. Like Grebennikov, I share what I know. Believe it or not, it’s up to you. But I warn: don’t attack me if you fail to replicate it. Many tried and reported partial weight loss, but reproducing the exact structure may be impossible without the right materials.

I planned to demonstrate outdoors, waving a stick above the disk to prove no threads were used. But now, with my device gone, I can only explain.

Philosophically, I’ll add: everything in nature has opposites—hot/cold, positive/negative, matter/antimatter, colors with complements. So if gravity exists, antigravity must also exist. Gravity is wave-like, so a counter-wave can produce antigravity. That’s what happens briefly when the disk resonates correctly.

Sadly, with the theft, I can’t continue. I’ll try to rebuild if I get the right material. Next time, I’ll also continue Grebennikov’s graviplane replication. The first panel block is already made, I just need to finish drilling.

Thanks to all subscribers and supporters. Sorry I can’t chat on Skype—the internet is too poor. My job abroad keeps me busy, so I can’t dedicate much time. But I’ll keep you updated when possible.

That’s all for now. Thanks to everyone who believes in me. Good luck to you all. Goodbye.
