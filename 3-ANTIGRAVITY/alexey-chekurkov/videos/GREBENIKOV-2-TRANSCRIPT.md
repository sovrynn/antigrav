Hello, dear friends! You're watching Garage Technologies Channel, and today we’re diving deep into Viktor Grebennikov’s anti-gravity platform. Many of you asked for a detailed breakdown, but some keep claiming Grebennikov was a fraud and his photos were faked.

Let’s approach this logically. I don’t blindly believe everything either—I verify. After scouring closed forums and subscriber tips, I’ve pieced together structural details rarely discussed. Most bloggers just rehash his book My World, but today, we’ll focus on the engineering.
What’s Inside the Platform?

    The Core Structure

        Grebennikov’s device mimics beetle wing patterns (specifically the golden ground beetle).

        Subscriber-leaked blueprints reveal:

            A toroidal vortex generator (likely for EM fields).

            Spiral coils wound to overcome gravity.

            Needle-like electrodes (similar to a Chizhevsky ionizer).

    High-Voltage System

        20–30 kV DC powers the platform, fed through a wooden frame with insulated wiring.

        Mesh grids (possibly from old TV cathode-ray tubes) act as waveguides.

        Activated charcoal electrodes (from gas masks) form asymmetric capacitors.

    Flight Mechanism

        Ion thrust alone can’t explain lift (despite Biefeld-Brown comparisons).

        Grebennikov described riding "two doughnut-shaped energy vortices"—likely torsion fields from the layered design:

            Ceramic base → Aluminum foil → Dielectric mesh → Carbon electrodes.

        Metal louvers at the bottom steer by redirecting "etheric flow" (his term for a putative gravitational field).

Key Evidence

    Leaked Schematics:

        A flat spiral coil (50+ turns) sits beneath the platform.

        Porous materials (like beehive cells) resonate at high frequencies.

        Pulsed HV discharges (10–20 kV) initiate lift, sustained by ambient charge.

    Subscriber Experiments:

        One replicated partial levitation using TV mask grids + activated charcoal, reporting brief hover at 15 kV.

        Another noted object repulsion when stacking foil, glass, and mesh (similar to Grebennikov’s "wing cake").

Why Hasn’t Anyone Rebuilt It?

    Material Challenges:

        Sourcing ultra-fine meshes and high-voltage components is hard (especially during lockdowns).

        Grebennikov likely used Soviet-era surplus (e.g., military-grade insulators).

    Theoretical Gaps:

        His notes reference "ether pressure"—a dismissed but resurgent concept in fringe physics.

        Modern attempts (like Project Bell) hint at similar principles but remain classified.

Final Thoughts

Grebennikov’s device wasn’t magic—it was applied biophysics. Whether it truly levitated or was an elaborate ionocraft is still debated. But dismissing it outright ignores:

    Consistent eyewitness accounts from Siberian researchers.

    Parallel work by Nazi Germany’s Bell Device and NASA’s later experiments.

Next video: I’ll share classified Soviet docs on torsion fields. Until then—stay skeptical, but curious.

(P.S. Police are patrolling my city due to COVID, so experiments are paused. Use this time to study!)
