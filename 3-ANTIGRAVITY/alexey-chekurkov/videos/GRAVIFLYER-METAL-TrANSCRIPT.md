Hello friends, you’re on the "Technology from the Garage" channel. Today’s episode is dedicated to a review of this metal, which many of you have asked me to talk about—what is this metal my device is made from? As you can see, it’s an aluminum disc, textured with a uniform coating. If you look at, for example, the wing cover of a beetle, you’ll see this roughness on the surface, and this roughness almost exactly matches the surface of this disc—in fact, the disc almost completely copies this roughness. So what does this give us? I want to show you some experiments testing this metal.

I’ve prepared metal discs—two smooth ones and one rough one—and I want to show you what this roughness does. If we try to generate electricity—as you know, this is like a galvanic pair, just like a battery. Regular tap water, no salt added—just want to see what happens. First, I’ll test two smooth discs, set up the multimeter at 2 volts, let’s see how much current is generated. We put the discs in—like a galvanic pair. We’re getting about 0.2 volts. 0.2 volts with smooth discs. Now it’s dropping to 0.1, maybe depending on distance, but basically the same—0.2 volts. Let’s take this as our reference: 0.2 volts. Now let’s test the rough disc. It’s giving us 0.5 volts! So roughness plays a role.

It’s not for nothing that beetle wings are smooth on one side and rough on the other—maybe like a capacitor, with one plate smooth and the other rough. Here it gives us 0.4 volts. So this structure has special properties—even rising to 0.47 volts! With smooth discs, we only got 0.2 volts. So, as you can see, nothing in nature is accidental—beetle wing covers have this structure for a reason. Smooth on top, rough underneath—and this allows it to generate electricity, even with just tap water—like a little battery, without any acids. Just regular water, and you see the effect of the structure—smooth and rough together. Look, it’s already outputting 0.6 volts and keeps increasing, unlike with the smooth discs. Mother Nature is wise in how she arranges structure and matter. My task is to figure out these secrets. Every time I do experiments, I discover something new—sometimes it even scares me how far this research might go! And the voltage keeps rising, unlike with smooth discs—a paradox. A regular galvanic pair, but the same metal shows different properties. Interesting things happen when you experiment. Remember: 0.6 volts was reached. Switching back to smooth discs: 0.5… then dropping to 0.2, 0.1. With smooth discs, you don’t see the same effect. So you see what secrets are hidden here!

Well, friends, we saw some properties of this metal. Experiments continue. Later I want to see what happens if I direct an ultrasonic emitter onto this metal. Maybe I’ll need to find the right frequencies, etc.—it has interesting properties, still unexplored. Beetle wing covers are said to generate electricity if you shine ultraviolet light on them. I haven’t tested this yet, as I don’t have a UV lamp—but I’ll get one and try.

One more interesting thing—what I found on this topic: I’m always searching for the easiest way to achieve levitation. Because I’m sure it should be simple, but I always go the complicated route—yet everything genius is simple. This was confirmed when I heard stories about crashed UFOs—when people entered, there were no engines, just a kind of asymmetrical capacitor made of domes. I’ve already talked about this in one of my videos—if you’ve watched carefully.

Now, maybe you’ve heard of the scientist Ignatov—here’s his device called the Panther Led. What does it remind you of? At first glance, it’s four Tesla coils combined into a cross, forming a vajra. Compare the vajra and Ignatov’s device—do they look similar? Also, in a recent video I mentioned that Tesla also used longitudinal waves from two or more coils. Here again—two or more coils. These are Tesla coils, but hexagonal. Remember Grebennikov—he said hexagonal structures act as a wave beacon. Look at the images—it’s all there: wave coils, everything together—Grebennikov’s technology, Tesla, Indian mythology. Water is important in Indian culture, too—mantras are said to make it more powerful, healthier, used for meditation, like an antenna tuning the mind to subtle vibrations. With its help, Indians extract information, like monks.

Back to the Panther Led: Ignatov made it as a student in an institute, tested it—rumor says it could lift up to five tons. It resembles the vajra and Tesla coils combined. Later, he took the designs to Moscow, but was found dead on the train, with no briefcase or blueprints. As you can see, powerful people don’t sleep, and this research goes on not just among scientists, but also hobbyists like us. Now I’ll show you a clip—someone patented a device…

This is Alexander Ivanovich Gornyak with his harmonizer, funny thing, he has a richly decorated apartment… We have Ural’s Karadag, Alexander Lukovich, as our guest…

So, as we see in the video, enthusiasts are getting fewer—they’re being silenced and harassed. I’m also trying to find the simplest way. But again, the path is complicated. If God wills, maybe I’ll find a simple method. I’ve tried levitating coils—choosing frequencies—I had coils tear apart in the process! With a 30 cm coil and the right number of turns, connected to a circuit, it starts jumping. This proves that the magnetic field disturbs space itself, not just objects—it can even vibrate on glass. The Lorentz force is involved, but the experiments are very interesting. Soon I’ll experiment with ultrasound and these plates, and with an asymmetric capacitor.

Experiments continue! Besides this, I’m doing lots of other things. Maybe the next video will be about psychotronic weapons—something interesting I encountered while experimenting with ultrasound and infrasound… But that’s for the next video, it could even be turned into a weapon… Meanwhile, enthusiasts keep working, though Seryov is the only one left in this field—he’s old and doesn’t share much, just shows his generator spinning (it doesn’t levitate), probably threatened or banned from talking.

I tell you all I know, nothing to hide. I’ll show you my experiments, even failed launches and landings of my device. As you see, I keep trying, showing what works—even some clips that didn’t make it into previous videos, I’ll show today. And yes, you were right in your comments on the last video—the ring wasn’t visible in the frame. I thought it was, but it wasn’t. People asked where my hands were, if I was opening or closing the ring—but you can see my hands by the reflections. I’ll reshoot it, and next time I’ll be sure to show everything in frame, all sides of the ring, to avoid questions.

Now let’s look at the footage that didn’t make it into other videos. All of these are my own clips—I decided to show them now.

Well friends, you’ve watched this video—I think I said everything I wanted to. As you can see, the metal itself isn’t important—it’s the structure that matters—could be copper, steel, whatever, the important thing is rough and smooth surfaces together—it’s like a capacitor. Finally, if you charge it, for example, I wanted to show this but didn’t include it earlier—look at this diagram: If you charge an object with electrons from below, using something like an electrophorus machine—if the bottom is negative and the top is positive, it rises; if reversed, it falls. Look at the diagram—I took it from the internet, I don’t invent this stuff, just collect, analyze, test, and do it all in my garage.

Finally, thanks to everyone who enjoyed the video—please click on the ads to support my channel, and good luck until next time!
