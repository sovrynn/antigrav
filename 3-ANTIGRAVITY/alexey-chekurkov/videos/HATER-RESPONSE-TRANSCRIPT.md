Hello, dear friends! You're watching Garage Technologies Channel, and I'm Alexey. Honestly, I didn’t want to waste time making this video addressing haters, but I keep getting comments like, "Look, this guy 'Leader' exposed you!"

Well, let’s see who he’s really "exposing." On his channel, he mostly targets online casinos, bloggers, and other random stuff. But today, we’ll focus on his so-called "exposés" of:

    Dyounov’s motor-wheel (which allegedly has over-unity efficiency).

    Mishin’s coils (used in healing therapy).

Alright, let’s see what he says about me.
"Leader’s" Claims About My Device

He says:

    "This whole fancy circuit makes Alexey Chekur’s ‘gravilet’ levitate. Seems like fantasy!"

    "I looked at his schematic and was shocked—it's full of errors. Any radio technician would say this won’t work."

    "It’s just a frequency generator, not anti-gravity. Ion wind (Biefeld-Brown effect) won’t lift this heavy thing."

First mistake: I never claimed my device works on ion thrust. That’s his assumption.
Does the Circuit Work?

He claims my Tesla coil (CST) "won’t work." Well, let’s see:
(Video clip shows the Tesla coil working perfectly.)
Strange, huh? If it "doesn’t work," why is it sparking?

Yes, I made a drawing error when copying the schematic—but that doesn’t mean the real circuit is wrong.
Ultrasonic Generator "Exposed"

He mocks:

    "This ultrasonic generator has no capacitors—how will it even start?!"

Reality check:
A quick Google search for "ultrasonic generator schematics" shows many capacitor-free designs, including the one I used (based on a toroidal transformer and a BC547 transistor).

His ignorance ≠ my fault.
"The Secret? Just Fishing Line!"

He insists:

    "The real trick is invisible fishing line. No anti-gravity here!"

My response:

    In my hoop test video, I clearly show the device passing through a gap where no string could be.

    If it were just fishing line, why does the device stabilize itself mid-air?

What About Mishin’s Coils?

"Leader" also "debunks" Mishin’s coils with a drunken "experiment":

    "I had a hangover vision that 600 Hz stimulates chakras, so let’s hook it up randomly!"
    (Proceeds to make nonsensical noises instead of testing properly.)

Real science? No. Just mockery.
His Behavior Says It All

At one point, he rants:
"You can fly to Europe on a dick at full gallop!"
(Yes, that’s a direct quote.)

Conclusion:

    He’s more interested in clowning than actual experiments.

    His "exposés" are baseless, often ignoring real science.

Final Words

I won’t waste more time on this. Actions speak louder than "debunking."

    Grebennikov was right: Even if you levitate in front of people, they’ll call you a fraud.

    Real research continues—whether he believes it or not.

Thanks for watching! This was Alexey from Garage Technologies Channel. Stay tuned for real experiments—no strings attached.

(P.S. Leader, if you’re reading this—next time, at least Google before you "expose" someone.)
