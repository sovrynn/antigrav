Hello YouTube, good day to everyone!
It’s me again, Alexey, and the Technology from the Garage channel.

Today I’ve just returned from a business trip and finally got back to my favorite work—continuing the topic of antigravity.
To some, it may seem amusing or strange, even unrealistic.
Many say, “Oh, that guy is sitting there making fakes.”
Well, whoever doesn’t believe—can just walk on by.
But those who are interested in hearing my thoughts—welcome to the channel.

0:40
Let’s look at the gravity effect of beetles described by Viktor Grebennikov in his book My World.

Here before you is the beetle’s structure.
Doesn’t it remind you of something?
These are basically asymmetric capacitors.

Wide plates here, thin plates there—it resembles the Biefeld–Brown frame, only inverted.
But this is the structure of a living beetle.
That’s where gravity effects come in.

1:31
So I thought about this:
Much is known about Grebennikov’s platform—there are drawings, photos, descriptions.
But strangely, no one really tries to actually build and experiment with something similar.

So when I came back from my trip, I sat down in my garage—my famous garage, the source of all my technologies—and started constructing a replica of Grebennikov’s platform.

Today, I’ll try to demonstrate a few experiments.
They’re rough, made “on the knee,” as they say—quick, improvised, because I don’t have much time (soon another trip).

But to keep my promise to subscribers and channel guests, I sacrificed some time to make this video.

2:50
Here are my experimental block panels for the platform—miniature versions.
I didn’t have the original material, so I cut up my last curved sheet to make these.

I copied the structure from My World.
Of course, many questions remain about the exact arrangement—whether the cells should spread like a fan or line up straight.
I did a rough version just to see what would happen.

3:59
These are the asymmetric capacitor plates.
Today, we’ll test them.

If you’re interested—settle in.
If not—you can watch something else.

4:31
In the writings, it’s noted: beetles fly.
But most beetles are not aerodynamic.
So they must rely on some antigravity effect.

Not all use it efficiently—only certain species, like the smooth beetle, or maybe scarabs.

But instead of tearing wings off beetles, let’s try to reproduce the effect artificially.

By the way, many people online test this with May beetle wings: rubbing, charging them with static, stacking them, and watching them scatter.
But that’s just typical electrostatics.

Still, Grebennikov himself noted: his device wouldn’t fly in rain or damp weather.
And beetles also don’t fly in such conditions.
So electrostatics clearly plays a role.

5:51
So, here are my capacitor plates.
Let’s test what they can do.

My voltage multiplier burned out, so I’ll have to use a simpler setup.

I connect the electrodes to the plates—about several kilovolts.

I’ll use small pieces of paper as indicators.

6:39
When I charge the plates, the papers scatter.
Yes, this looks like electrostatics—but there’s also something else to notice.

No paper stays in place—they’re all repelled strongly.
Even heavier ones fly off.

When the paper falls back onto the plate, it sometimes sticks with opposite charge.

The field definitely throws the paper upward—some hover briefly.

This shows an effect worth investigating.

12:37
Now, conclusions.
What Viktor Stepanovich Grebennikov didn’t fully explain:

The plates must be arranged in groups of four, creating a wave shift.

Several block panels would be needed, arranged and adjustable.

Likely, he used natural insect “cells” (honeycomb-like), but coated them with aluminum or another conductor to make them work with voltage.

The power supply could have been something as simple as a battery or a compact high-voltage source.

He wasn’t a professional engineer—so the system must have been simple.
But, as with electronics, even a simple system requires precise details for it to work.

15:00
So, my plan:
I need to complete these panels, find more material, and assemble movable sections to replicate the effect more accurately.

But this all requires time, money, and resources.
It would be better if enthusiasts collaborated.

Maybe someday we could gather in a Skype conference to discuss experiments together.

16:27
In the meantime, I encourage you to try building similar structures yourselves.
Experiment with asymmetric capacitors—they show antigravity-like effects.

And don’t think it requires super-complex technology.
Even the famous Roswell UFO (1947) was described as having no visible engine—just layered capacitor-like structures inside.

There are even places in Georgia and Israel where bottles and cars roll uphill—strange antigravity-like anomalies.

So, antigravity may be achieved by simple methods, not necessarily by highly advanced ones.

22:00
Once I get more material, I’ll try to build a larger disk, take it outdoors, and see if I can make it rise at least 10 meters.
If I succeed, I’ll record it on video in an open field, away from wires or trees—so there’s no suspicion of trickery.

23:01
By the way, in My World, Grebennikov gave hints:
He stacked wing covers, fastened them with paperclips, and noticed an “invisibility effect.”
Light waves bent around the structure, making it unseen.

This suggests his platform may have had multiple layers of panels, not just one.

He described it in a fairy-tale-like way, perhaps so people wouldn’t take it literally, but the clues are there.

24:36
So try making such plates yourself—nothing too difficult.
Anyone with basic electronics skills can build them and test with high voltage.

I burned out my multiplier, but still managed to film this on a simpler setup.

25:45
I’m surprised so few people experiment seriously with this.
It’s not that hard—just patience is needed.

You need to study the exact structure carefully, maybe under magnification, and replicate it faithfully.
That could produce stronger results.

26:04
Anyway, thanks to all who believe in me and subscribe to my channel.
I wish you all good luck.

I’ll be away for a bit, but soon I’ll post new videos—possibly on Tesla devices, energy harvesting, or my magnetic engine experiments.
Always in open fields, under fair conditions—so no one can say it’s fake.

So, take courage, experiment, and good luck!

This was Alexey and Technology from the Garage.
Remember—even the first computers were built in garages.

Goodbye for now!
