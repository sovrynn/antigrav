Hello, dear subscribers and guests of the Technology from the Garage channel.
Today we continue the topic of antigravity, which many people enjoy—though, of course, some take it critically.
The thing is, the phenomenon itself is unusual—“too good to be true,” as some would say.

Today we’ll talk a bit about theory and a bit about practical experiments.
This video is dedicated to those aspects.

Because without theory, practice is blind.
And practice without theory is foolish.
So let’s strengthen our understanding a little and talk about the theory of gravity shielding.

Many seekers of antigravity tend to complicate things and come up with very complex designs.
In fact, the answer, as always, is simple.

Let’s recall Grebennikov.
He began with small graviplatform models made of improvised materials: paper, film, foil, thread, wire.
That’s what his first prototypes were built from.

And what pushed him to make them? He studied beetles.
Remember, I showed how their wing structure is peculiar, but in principle, not too complicated—and reproducible.

First, let’s consider a common theory of gravity.
People often ask me: “Do you, dear author, know what gravity really is?”

To understand antigravity, you first need to understand gravity itself.

So:
The Earth has a large mass of matter. Matter consists of ether, and matter constantly grows.
Why? Because matter continuously absorbs ether.
Ether crystallizes inside matter and turns into more matter.

This ether flow is what pulls us to the Earth—it kind of sucks us in, pressing us down.
Ether easily passes through matter, but matter acts like a coarse sieve to ether.
Even a sieve has some “drag,” and that’s enough to create the force of attraction.

But think carefully: we aren’t so much “pulled” to the Earth as we are drawn in by it.
So gravity may be thought of as suction rather than pressure.

If that’s the case, then to shield against gravity, the screen must be placed underneath, facing the Earth.
That matches Grebennikov’s platform design—the screen was below, and he stood on top.

So the first conclusion: shielding must be from the Earth side.

3:54
Now, what can we make a shield from?
Ordinary matter won’t work—ether passes through it like water through a net.

But we can influence ether indirectly—by affecting matter.
How? With electric and magnetic fields.

Think:

With voltage, an electromagnet creates a magnetic field.

With voltage, a lamp emits light.

With voltage, antennas send electromagnetic waves.

All these are ways matter affects ether.

So the second conclusion: ether can only be influenced by influencing matter.

5:16
Now the key question: how to influence ether to create a shield against Earth’s pull?

Let’s remember how a capacitor works.
A capacitor consists of plates and a dielectric.
Charge is stored in the dielectric.
Inside, dipoles align according to the applied voltage.

So, polarized dipoles interact with ether, distorting its flow.

Case 1: If the capacitor is placed flat between Earth and an object, nothing changes—the alignment matches Earth’s gravitational flow.

Case 2: If we tilt the capacitor at 45°, the dipoles distort ether flow in that zone.
That creates partial shielding.

Now imagine making an accordion-shaped (folded) capacitor.
Take foil plates, a high-voltage dielectric (special paper), fold it like an accordion, and assemble the capacitor.

Then we balance a wooden ruler.
We put the capacitor under it and charge it with ~16,000 volts.

Surprisingly, at the moment of charging and discharging, the ruler tips upward—it loses weight.
This isn’t just electrostatics—it’s another effect.
You can even hear a faint sound during discharge, and the ruler jerks upward.

When fully charged or discharged, equilibrium returns—the ether adapts.
So, to keep the effect continuous, we need spark gaps across the capacitor to create a glow discharge.

8:47
Here’s an important detail:
The shield itself does not lose weight.
It’s the object above the shield that loses weight.

This is the main mistake of many researchers—they try to make the platform itself fly.
In reality, the platform will only fly if there is a heavy enough load (like a pilot) above it.
The heavier the load, the better the lift effect.

That’s why Grebennikov’s platform worked only with a person standing on it.

9:19
Now look at this diagram of a “flying saucer” from Third Reich engineers (taken from archives).
Notice the upper disk membrane folded like an accordion.
That’s exactly what created the levitation effect.

Pulsed charges were applied to it.
The folded structure prevented ether from stabilizing.
This imbalance caused lift.

Levitation, therefore, occurred due to disturbed ether equilibrium.

The only remaining question is: what exact pulse timing, voltage, and intensity are needed?
That is something only further experiments will reveal.
