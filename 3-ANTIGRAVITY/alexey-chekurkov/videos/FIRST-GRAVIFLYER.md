Hello YouTube, good day to everyone. Today we have a most interesting topic—dedicated to all fans of anomalous phenomena, flying saucers, and other mysteries.

As you can see, I’ve got this little contraption here—it’s a replica of a UFO. Many of you have already seen attempts online to build something like this, starting with Viktor Grebennikov, and even earlier, going back to ancient times. Some of you may know about the Vimanika Shastra, some may have read those treatises on the “vimanas,” and some of you may know people like Viktor Schauberger.

What you see here is my replica of a flying saucer. I decided to build it and see what would happen.

A quick overview: we see two disks. One rotates against the other. The main component is a high-voltage generator and other such parts.

So, let’s try to start it up.
First disk—running.
Second disk—running.

And now the most important part—connecting the high-voltage generator. This is needed to create the effect of zero gravity—or even antigravity.

The generator block uses a flyback transformer from a TV, plus a simple homemade voltage multiplier.

Okay, connection made. Now we wait a few seconds while the fields magnetize, and then we should see the antigravity effect. Hopefully everyone can see…

Hmm, it didn’t quite work. The fields didn’t align, or maybe the voltage is too low. Last time it worked better. Something’s off this time—there are so many little nuances: the right voltage, the exact RPM of the disks, the proper spacing between them. Today it just won’t cooperate, but before it was better.

By the way, there are also neodymium magnets here. When the high voltage is applied across the plates, and with the disks spinning in opposite directions, it should work. You’ve probably already seen similar setups online—in documentaries about Nazi Germany’s supposed flying saucers. My design has a few small modifications: those neodymium magnets should enhance the field.

But still, something’s wrong today. Maybe the magnet orientation, maybe something else. I’ll need to figure it out.

Anyway, in the next video I’ll try to make a better demonstration. The beginning has been made, as they say. I feel I’m close—like in The X-Files: the truth is out there, nearby, but I can’t quite grasp it yet.

So the next video will be a more detailed examination, and I’ll try launching it not with this mess of wires but in autonomous mode, maybe outside.

So, subscribe to the channel, leave likes, and stay tuned. I’d love to hear your comments—even critical ones. I’m looking for like-minded people interested in flying saucers and other anomalous things.

Also, I want to discuss Viktor Grebennikov’s book My World. In it, he describes this very kind of platform. The book contains many hints. I’ve already figured out quite a few of them, and in my next video I’ll review what I’ve learned and attempt a replica of Grebennikov’s platform.

For now—see you all next time.
