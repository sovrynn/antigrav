Hello, dear friends! You're watching Garage Technologies Channel, and today we continue with an exciting topic—anti-gravity devices. Many of you were surprised and even outraged by my previous video where I told the truth about that Bulgarian guy’s box (under the nickname MVD, his name is Mark Tech). You might be wondering: Why did I, having a working model, suddenly return to this strange pair of devices? After all, everyone who saw that video unanimously agrees it’s fake.

At first glance, it does look like pure fantasy—like Baba Yaga stepping onto an anti-gravity platform and entering parallel worlds. Of course, this seems unbelievable, and most dismiss it as madness. But why did I revisit this box? The reason is that certain events piqued my interest.

Subscribers often send me interesting facts, and one of them shared something remarkable—a case from China a year or two ago. A boy walking down the street found a strange object descending from the sky. He caught it and brought it home. You can see this disc on the screen now.

Now, compare it to Mark’s box—look closely. Notice the bottom part. Does it remind you of anything? That’s right—the same pattern! This raises a question: Did Mark really create his device just a few years ago without knowing about this incident?

This is why I returned to this topic. I suspect that beneath all the alleged "fakes," there might be some truth. If his device truly worked, authorities would have shut him down long ago. That’s why he’s cautious, working only with trusted people.

Now, about my own experiments—I initially built this device incorrectly. Instead of activated charcoal, I used graphite. Let’s compare their properties:

    Graphite: No conductivity detected.

    Activated charcoal: Shows conductivity (~158-159 Ω).

This was my first mistake. Graphite has a different structure and doesn’t work the same way.

Another interesting detail: Reich’s tubes. Look at them—do they remind you of anything? Beehive cells, right? These tubes are meant to concentrate de Broglie waves in one direction. But I assembled them wrong—they must maintain a standing wave ratio of 1:3.

Here’s how it should be done:

    Measure the inner diameter (e.g., 12 mm).

    Multiply by 3 → 36 mm (this is the required length).

    The layers (foil and paper) must be equal in number.

If assembled correctly, you can even feel a cold draft emanating from the tube. I tested it—even an improperly made tube showed effects under sunlight. A properly built one with a stronger energy source could work much better.

Now, about my gravitational device—I made another mistake. The rear disc should be a copper electrode, but I initially used the wrong material. I’m now preparing an electret (a material that retains electrostatic charge). It’s made from 30-40% wax + 60-70% rosin, melted and charged under high voltage. If spun, it should create a Coulomb effect.
Why am I doing all this?

Because I believe in open knowledge. If we keep hiding discoveries, we’ll keep relying on gasoline forever.

Some interesting facts shared by subscribers:

    A story about mercury (Hg) mixed into dough—when heated, the pancakes levitated. (Ancient Indian Vimanas supposedly used mercury propulsion.)

    Two radio amateurs replicated Grebennikov’s effect using a TV’s high-voltage wire wrapped in foil—objects flew away with a crackling sound.

Addressing Critics

Some accuse me of fakery—like when I waved a curved stick around my device, claiming it proved no strings were attached. Try it yourself: hang an object and wave a stick—you’ll see it’s not easy to fake.

I deleted my last video out of frustration—people called me a fraud even when I showed clear proof. Grebennikov himself once said: "Even if I levitate in front of everyone, they’ll still call me a charlatan."
Future Plans

    Grebennikov’s Platform: I’ll reveal constructive details rarely seen elsewhere.

    Kozyrev Mirrors: Experiments with "time prediction."

    Magnetic Motor: A new idea to make it work.

For those who say "Leader exposed you!"—I have ironclad counterarguments. That guy just craves attention, dismissing real experiments (like Mishin’s coils or Danov’s wheel) without understanding them.
Final Words

I’m not hiding anything. If we share knowledge, we’ll move forward. Otherwise, we’ll stay stuck in the past.

Thank you for watching! This was Alexey from Garage Technologies Channel. See you in the next video—it’s going to be interesting!
