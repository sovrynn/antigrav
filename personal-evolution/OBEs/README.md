# Ideas vs Genuine Will/Creation

There is a stark difference between saying words in person or in your head, symbols, or having thoughts (which are just ideas, and often come up randomly and don't express your genuine will)

And genuine will, which is reflected in decision

# My desires

I want to elevate my being to a higher level.

I want to elevate my sight to a higher level, to see the oneness of it all.

I want to learn the reality of the physics behind the world so that I can make my own UFO and fly around the world.

I want to learn about extraterrestrial beings and see them and meet them.

I want to know and learn and see everything!
