            <p align="left">"Back in the 1970s and 1980s a researcher
              and author&nbsp; named Willam Moore&nbsp; --- best known
              as the co-author of such folk-lore as "The Roswell
              Incident" and "The Philadelphia Experiment" (there, I said
              it...), wrote a couple of articles about Townsend
              Brown.&nbsp; Moore was also the last journalist to
              interview and photograph&nbsp; Brown shortly before his
              death in 1985. </p>
            <p align="left">"Somehow, during that period, Moore obtained
              access to Brown's personal laboratory notebooks, and,
              presumably, obtained permission to "publish" three volumes
              of those journals.&nbsp; Photo-copies of those journals
              have been in circulation ever since."</p>

                Gravitational Isotopes</i></b><a name="1"></a> </p>
          <p align="left">Leesburg VA, Oct. 7, 1955 </p>
          <p align="left">(a) An announcement has been made both in the
            newspapers and on the radio (within the last few days) that
            the contract for the launching gear of the proposed space
            satellite has been awarded the Glenn S. Martin Co and the
            contract for the rocket motor to General Electric. </p>
          <p align="left">This brings to mind the statement of M. K.
            Jessup in "The Case for the UFO" --- "If the money, thought,
            time and energy now being poured uselessly into the
            development of rocket propulsion were invested in a basic
            study of gravitation, it is altogether likely that we could
            have effective and economical space travel, at a small
            fraction of the ultimate cost which we are now incurring,
            within one decade". </p>
          <p align="left">As to a study of gravitation, there are two
            phases --- (a) the dynamic and (b) the static. In dynamic
            considerations, electrical energy causes a local distortion
            in the gravitational field which results in the generation
            of a ponderomotive force and motion results. In the static
            considerations, an electric situation exists which causes
            matter to be lighter (or heavier) than it normally should
            be. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 4</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In nature, matter has gravitational
            susceptibility, that is --- it is acted upon and responds to
            a gravitational field. This is expressed as gravitational
            mass, and bears no direct relationship to the inertial mass
            or reluctance to acceleration. The measure of gravitational
            mass is specific gravity. </p>
          <p align="left">A study of the specific gravity of the
            elements reveals that, in many instances, a wide range of
            values are observed for the same element. Even where the
            chemical purity of the element is uniform a change or range
            of specific gravity values appears commonplace. </p>
          <p align="left">It is my hypothesis that all elements are
            composed of lighter and heavier isotopes (values of specific
            gravity) which differ from the mean value of the composition
            as a whole. Where the lighter fractions predominate, the
            mean value of specific gravity is less than normal. It may
            be said to have a predominance of negative gravitational
            isotopes. Where the mean values are greater than normal, the
            composition may be said to have a predominance of positive
            gravitational isotopes. No element appears to be completely
            "normal" or free from this effect. </p>
          <p align="left">For any given element, there probably exists
            (and this remains to be shown) a reciprocal relationship
            between the gravitational mass and the inertial mass. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 5</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Heavier gravitational isotopes of the element
            possess less inertial mass --- and vice versa. The product
            of the two forms of mass probably equal a constant. </p>
          <p align="left">m<sub>g</sub> m<sub>i</sub> = E. </p>
          <p align="left">The energy relationships probably are
            unstable, the tendency being to reach an equilibrium
            condition of equality. </p>
          <p align="left">m<sub>g&nbsp;</sub> = m<sub>i</sub> </p>
          <p align="left">The spontaneous evolution of heat as observed
            by Brush and Harrington appears to be associated with light
            gravitational isotopes. This means excessive inertial mass,
            the energy of which is radiated and lost, and this in turn
            is the cause of decay of the anomalous gravitational effect.
          </p>
          <p align="left">For example, the rare earth group of elements
            appears to have strong negative anomalies --- that is, they
            are lighter than they should be. That they should also
            exhibit relatively high evolution of heat (spontaneously)
            follows. (This heating effect by rare earth elements remains
            to be discovered). Assuming that such is the case, the
            heating effect is present only where equilibrium has not
            been reached, and the temperature differential is
            quantitatively related to the abnormal lightness. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 6</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Since energy (thermal) is released until
            equilibrium between M<sub>g</sub> and M<sub>i</sub> is
            realized, it is obvious that the effect is subject to the
            usual rate of decay, reaching zero asymptotically. </p>
          <p align="left">In the case of positive isotopes --- an
            absorption of that would be expected. Such absorption would
            cause the sample to be colder than its environment. </p>
          <p align="left">If the effect noted above is not actually
            present (and there is as yet no evidence of heat
            absorption), it is possible that positive isotopes as such
            do not exist and that the present indicated mean specific
            gravity is actually negative and that the true "normal" or
            base is at least as high as the heaviest value indicated. </p>
          <p align="left">Methods of beneficiation are the subject of
            current patent applications. Methods involve successive
            steps of settling and centrifuging. The separation is of the
            isotopes in the mixture, (a) the lighter weight and more
            massive fraction and (b) the heavier and less massive
            fraction respectively. </p>
          <p align="left">No information has come to light regarding the
            modus operand of the creation of the light gravitational
            isotopes in the first place. It has been assumed, as in the
            case of mass isotopes that they have been present since the
            creation of the physical world. </p>

          <p align="left">Leesburg VA, Oct. 7, 1955. </p>
          <p align="left">The creation of light gravitational isotopes
            requires energy. Thermal energy is evolved during the decay
            of these isotopes, but it is probable that a greater source
            of energy than that available from heat is necessary for the
            creation of these lighter fractions. An exception may be
            taken, of course, to the high thermal energies present for
            example in the sun or during nuclear reactions. </p>
          <p align="left">Atomic piles provide energy through the
            fissioning of nuclei of the radioactive group to form nuclei
            of the rare earth group. These nascent isotopes may turn out
            to be a rich source --- produced in the same fashion as the
            rare earth elements were produced in the original creation
            (a primordial explosion). </p>

          <p align="left">Leesburg, VA, October 7, 1955. </p>
          <p align="left">There appears to be evidence, however tenuous
            and perhaps controversial, that a civilization existed on
            the earth 70,000 to 200,000 years ago. It may be said that
            this civilization had simple and effective ways of moving
            stone --- based on today’s standards. </p>
          <p align="left">In the high Andes of Peru --- the Sachahuaman
            Fortress --- stones weighing 200 tons each were fitted
            together so closely that a knife blade cannot be inserted
            between them. </p>
          <p align="left">Enormous stones --- 14’ x 17’ x 70’, weighing
            upwards to 1200 tons, were moved and placed in position in
            various parts of the world. Baalbek, Easter Island, as well
            as in Peru. (See "Case for the UFO" by Jessup). It has been
            suggested that some form of levitation employed by the
            ancients made possible the moving of these enormous stones.
          </p>
          <p align="left">I submit that the weight of these stones may
            have changed since they were quarried, that the change may
            have been rapid at first and then slowed down as the years
            passed. </p>
          <p align="left">To develop this hypothesis, the following is
            suggested: </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 10</i> </p>
          <p align="left">At some time between 70,000 and 200,000 years
            ago, a worldwide change occurred which created or recreated
            light gravitational isotopes. This could have been a sudden
            increase in the intensity of cosmic radiation or it could
            have been a close approach or contact with a comet. </p>
          <p align="left">The result nevertheless was a rapid and
            effective increase in the content of light gravitational
            isotopes in certain susceptible materials. This increase
            presumably was limited to certain clays and rocks. The
            resulting loss of weight caused tectonic forces and started
            mountain building processes. </p>
          <p align="left">The continent of Atlantis may have risen from
            the ocean during this period. During the height of this
            gravitational revolution, many materials were phenomenally
            light and could be transported with ease. Certain substances
            may have had negative gravitational mass and escaped from
            the earth. Structures to fly in the air may have been
            constructed from common materials by beneficiating from
            entrapping or loading materials. </p>
          <p align="left">Men turned with ease toward the quarrying of
            huge masses of stone simply because they were able to lift
            and move them. It is my hypothesis that the largest stones
            cold be carried by a relatively few men. They literally
            floated through the air, like huge logs floating on water.
            Their inertial mass, however, must have been enormous. When
            motionless they must have required great force to start them
            moving and, when in motion, they must have required equally
            great effort to stop them! </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 11</i> </p>
          <p align="left">This period of "lightness" must have lasted
            many centuries, because during that time a flourishing,
            highly developed human society evolved. </p>
          <p align="left">Decay of the light gravitational isotopes
            began when the factor causing their synthesis ceased to be
            operative. This decay, similar to radioactive decay, was
            very rapid at the start, diminishing in rate as the
            centuries passed. </p>
          <p align="left">It is presumed that unless synthesis is now
            operating or has been more or less regularly operating
            during the intervening time, decay of this original effect
            is still proceeding. The result then would be a continuing
            increase in the weight of these rocks. </p>
          <p align="left">During the first few centuries of weight
            "increase", great tectonic forces similar but opposite to
            those which originally created "Atlantis", now served to
            destroy it. Great loading due to the increase in weight of
            these specific rocks, together with isostatic flow, would
            have caused the sinking of the mythical continent. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 12</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In brief, therefore, the disappearance of
            Atlantis may be related to and concurrent with the
            termination of quarrying operations of the huge stones. The
            same increase of weight, caused by the decay of light
            isotopes, caused by the decay of light isotopes, is the
            reason, so it seems. </p>

            (and others) be accurately weighed each year for several

          <p align="left">Leesburg VA, Dec. 25, 1955 </p>
          <p align="left">An exact definition of a gravitational
            isotope, particularly one which sets forth physical forms,
            is urgently needed. It is almost impossible to make progress
            in any direction until this is done. </p>
          <p align="left">In searching various possibilities, the
            following interesting facts present themselves: </p>
          <p align="left">(1) In transistor theory, conductivity s
            attributed to the migration of "holes", as well as to
            electrons. The holes appear to possess (or at least exhibit
            the equivalence of unit positive charges, equal to the unit
            negative charges carried by electrons. As a matter of
            mathematical convenience, the holes may be treated as having
            the same mass as an electron. </p>
          <p align="left">(2) The definition of a hole is as elusive as
            that of a negative gravitational isotope. It is interesting
            to speculate for the time being on the possibility that
            there may be a relationship. </p>
          <p align="left">To begin with, they are holes in what?
            Apparently, valence positions in the crystal lattice where
            valence electrons are missing. But the mechanisms by which a
            vacancy can be passed on progressively, with the physical
            property of a mass in motion, is not clear. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 17</i> </p>
          <p align="left">The revisions in the theory of conductivity,
            which have resulted of necessity from the study of
            semi-conductors, have provided evidence of&nbsp; "positive
            carriers" hitherto unknown or unrecognized. </p>
          <p align="left">It is significant that these positive carriers
            are influenced by electric and/or magnetic fields in a way
            which is equivalent in every respect to the behavior of
            positive charges. They are indistinguishable, therefore,
            from charges. </p>
          <p align="left">That they may exist in paired, dipole or
            neutralized relation with charges of opposite sign
            necessarily follows. </p>
          <p align="left">Just as in other examples of pair creation, a
            photon may supply the energy. It is not clear, for example,
            whether the photon actually "creates" the positive-negative
            pair( with a mass of 2m), representing the equivalent mass
            energy value of the photon, or whether the total mass (2m)
            remains the same, with the photon merely supplying the
            energy to dissociate the pair. </p>
          <p align="left">Furthermore, if a valence hole is filled by an
            electron of the same but opposite charge, both are
            annihilated, and an extra electron is necessary to produce
            any net effect. </p>
          <p align="left">The energy of annihilation is radiated as a
            photon. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 18</i> </p>
          <p align="left">If valence holes are representative of a class
            of positive charges found occasionally in the electronic
            shells of atoms, one may speculate upon similar charges in
            the nucleus. In most cases, such charges would be
            neutralized by electrons, and not enter into the electric
            balance of the atom. </p>
          <p align="left">Now, therefore, if one takes the bold step of
            postulating that holes (either as found in crystal lattice,
            complex electronic shells or nuclei) are holes in the
            negative effluvium, what is their gravitational mass
            (weight)? Let us postulate the existence of an entity which
            is merely a rarefaction of the negative effluvium, as
            contrasted with a local compression of effluvium which may
            be an electron. </p>
          <p align="left">If then, gravitational potential is
            synchronous with the potential of the negative effluvium,
            gravitational gradients exist as follows: </p>

            effluvium, the "elastic" compression of which represents
            potential energy. In the vicinity of large masses, the ether
            is less compressed, the potential energy of space is lower,
            but the potential energy of the mass is considerable (as
            represented by E + mc<sup>2</sup>), so that the total

          <p align="left">At first impression, and this may be
            ultimately borne out, the electrons would possess weight
            (gravitational mass in the positive sense) whereas the
            "holes" may be lofting (negative gravitational mass). Both
            would possess inertial mass. A pair would be gravitationally
            and electrically neutral but would possess 2m initially. </p>

          <p align="left">Upon recombination, energy would be radiated
            as photons. </p>
          <p align="left">In summary, certain photo-emissive substances
            (perhaps complex silicates, lavas, and many other materials
            found in nature), when irradiated, may be found to lose
            weight. These materials would acquire a positive charge if
            insulated, but usually, in the process of weighing, the
            charge is lost. Similarly, the inertial mass (or the inertia
            with respect to the weight) will increase. </p>

                Light Gravitational Isotopes</i></b><a name="7"></a> </p>
          <p align="left">Leesburg, VA, Jan. 7, 1956 </p>
          <p align="left">In the Brush experiment relating to
            heat-treated metals, certain case-hardened steels indicated
            an actual loss of weight following the heat treatment. In
            measurements of the specific gravity (or density) of various
            metal wires (platinum, tungsten, etc.), the values observed
            seem to vary in an unpredictable way with the amount of
            drawing or working which has preceded the measurement. In
            most cases, working decreases the specific gravity. </p>
          <p align="left">In the measurement of specific gravity, it is
            desirable always to use the specimen which is most
            representative of the physical state of the material tested.
            In the main, the specimen should be free of porosity.
            Compression usually reduces this porosity and increases
            density. </p>
          <p align="left">After a certain point, further compression,
            hammering and/or working does not increase the apparent
            density of the specimen but actually decreases. The result
            appears to be an actual decrease in the weight of the
            specimen due to the working. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 22</i> </p>
          <p align="left">One may summarize, therefore, that if the
            effects of porosity are not considered, continued working of
            certain metals reduces their specific gravity. </p>
          <p align="left">One may speculate, as a further step, that
            there may be a concurrent reduction of tensile strength with
            specific gravity, ad further, that the entire problem of
            fatigue in metals may be related to this phenomenon. </p>
          <p align="left">In pursuance of such a hypothesis, the
            following ideas emerge: </p>
          <p align="left">(a) Because of continuing flexing, a strip of
            metal becomes heated presumably due to inter-molecular
            friction. If course, the question as to whether the
            molecules in the crystal lattice actually rub together in
            the mechanical sense gives one misgivings. It is more
            accurate probably to say that the coulomb damping in and
            between the electric shells of the component atoms, carried
            in part by the valence electrons, causes the release of
            these electrons and the creation of "holes". Or, similarly,
            from an energy standpoint, the available heat (as photons)
            causes "electron-hole" pair creation, with a possible
            increase in the electrical conductivity in the flexed
            specimen. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 23</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Based on the assumption that flexing increases
            the population of holes, it is reasonable to look for a
            decrease in weight. If the holes represent loss of valence
            electrons (binding energy or cohesive force), it is
            reasonable to look for a gradual or progressive weakening of
            the metal or fatigue. </p>
          <p align="left">(c) In and specific region, saturation of
            holes is reached when fracture occurs, or vice versa. This
            is also the point at which specific gravity is minimum,
            i.e., the sample is gravitationally lightest. </p>
          <p align="left">(d) A critical experiment suggests itself: A
            thin specimen of susceptible metals (aluminum, tantalum,
            tungsten, platinum) is carefully weighed. It is then
            continually stressed (or simply bent back and forth) until
            it fractures, care being taken to lose no pieces. The broken
            parts (in toto) are then weighed and the loss of weight (if
            any) is noted immediately. </p>
          <p align="left">(e) Due to the decay of the holes by
            recombination with electrons, the weighing of the broken
            specimen (pieces) must be performed as quickly after
            fracture as possible. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 24</i> </p>
          <p align="left">(f) If such an experiment gives positive
            results, the following possibilities are of great interest:
          </p>
          <p align="left">(1). The production of light gravitational
            isotopes by mechanical manipulation. </p>
          <p align="left">(2) Large scale changes in weight due to
            tectonic forces and movement in the crust of the Earth. </p>
          <p align="left">(3) Nascent gravitational isotopes in recent
            lava "coolings" that have moved until cool. </p>
          <p align="left">(4) Loss of weight of recently forged
            specimens, hammered, hot or cold rolled, especially after
            excessive mechanical working. </p>
          <p align="left">(5) Loss of weight of recently crushed rock,
            pulverized sand or clays. </p>
          <p align="left">(6) Extension of knowledge as to the cause of
            fatigue (crystallization) in mtals. </p>
          <p align="left">(7) Change in properties due to cold flow as
            distinguished from elasticity. </p>
          <p align="left">(8) Spontaneous generation of heat as
            gravitational isotopes decay through annihilation of
            electron-hole pairs and emission of photons. </p>
          <p align="left">(9) Decay of heating effect according to

          <p align="left">(10) Warmth of recently crushed rock or sand
            and the decay of the warmth with time. </p>
          <p align="left">(11) Altering the rate of decay, i.e.,
            speeding up decay by negativity (elec.), slowing up decay by
            positivity. </p>

          <p align="left">In the foregoing hypotheses, the existence of
            lighter (than normal) gravitational fractions is proposed.
            It is reasoned that certain presently unexplained behavior
            of matter (such as the Brush Effects and the anomalous
            densities of many elements and compounds) may be adequately
            accounted for if one postulates the existence in nature of
            lighter and/or heavier fractions in the gravitational sense.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Development of this view introduces the
            necessity to define "mass" and to distinguish two kinds of
            mass:--- </p>
          <p align="left">(1) Gravitational Mass (m<sub>g</sub>) as
            being the quality of matter susceptible to or reacting upon
            the (any) gravitational field, and </p>
          <p align="left">(2) Inertial Mass ( m<sub>i</sub> ) as being
            the quality of matter susceptible to or reacting with
            acceleration or centrifuging force. </p>
          <p align="left">A tentative relationship would be: </p>
          <p align="left">m<sub>e</sub> m<sub>i</sub> = , constant, </p>
          <p align="left">where <i>e</i> is an unknown exponent. </p>
          <p align="left">The constant represents the total potential
            energy E of the mass in the equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 27</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Therefore, for any given mass, since E = m<sub>g</sub><sup>e</sup>
            m<sub>i</sub> C<sup>2</sup> ; therefore, m<sub>g</sub><sup>e</sup>
            || 1 / m<sub>i</sub>. </p>
          <p align="left">For any given mass, the alteration of weight
            must accompany an alteration of inertial mass in an inverse
            relationship. </p>
          <p align="left">In the first concept of gravitational
            isotopes, the accepted value for the density (gr/cc) of an
            element or compound represented merely a mean value, with
            both lighter and heavier fractions in varying proportions
            being present. </p>
          <p align="left">If, for example, the mean value is less than
            the theoretically normal value (see chart of gravity
            anomalies of the elements), it is reasoned that the element,
            or at least that particular sample of the element, contains
            gravitationally lighter components. </p>
          <p align="left">Let us consider the nature of these lighter
            components. </p>
          <p align="left">It would appear that inasmuch as all elements
            exhibits the presence of those components, the active agent
            is probably common to all and may take the form of a
            fundamental particle --- of anti-gravitational properties. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 28</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Such a particle may be said to have negative
            gravitational permeability and exhibit negative g. In free
            state, it would accelerate "upward" or loft. Its potential
            energy would be greatest, for example, at the surface of the
            earth and it would diminish as the particle "falls away"
            from the earth --- converting this gravitational potential
            energy into kinetic energy. </p>
          <p align="left">It will be seen that this property is the
            converse of that of ordinary mater. In this sense, such a
            lofting particle may be described as "contra-terrene". While
            the gravitational mass of such a particle may be said to be
            negative (for the reason that it is repelled in a
            gravitational field), the inertial mass is positive. </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, as the particle accelerates in
            escaping, it acquires momentum. This positive mass is
            revealed during acceleration and in any centrifugal
            situation. </p>
          <p align="left">Now, as to the nature of the
            anti-gravitational particle, considerable uncertainty exists
            in my mind. I shall try to resolve some of this, but the
            final answers can be given only after definitive experiments
            have provided the answers. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 29</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In the foregoing entries in this book wherein
            gravitational isotopes were mentioned, the concept seemed to
            revolve around the possibilities of holes in the effluvium
            wherein a kind of gravitational buoyancy existed. </p>
          <p align="left">The holes of a semi-conductor appear as
            possibilities in this respect. If so, the anti-gravitational
            particle must be associated with electrical positivity. This
            would be particularly true if the effluvium itself is
            negative --- as an indefinitely extended diffuse electron
            ocean, but with a potential gradient to provide the
            direction of force. </p>
          <p align="left">Such holes are observed as the absence of
            electrons and hence behave as positrons. They are,
            therefore, of the same general magnitude as electrons. Holes
            and electrons are created n pairs by the action of a photon
            of the proper energy. It would tentatively appear that a low
            energy photon (heat) causes a slight separation of hole and
            electron, as in a dipole creation, whereas a high energy
            photon causes a further separation to the point where
            binding is lost and the separated particles take up
            independent lives. Here the energy of the photon equals or
            exceeds the binding energy of the pair. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 30</i> </p>
          <p align="left">On a much smaller scale, but perhaps equally
            significant, is the creation of the neutrino and the
            anti-neutrino. Energy is required to create such a pair and
            that energy is released upon recombination or annihilation
            of the pair. </p>
          <p align="left">For the moment, let us consider only the
            possibilities of the larger scale effect; that is, those
            effects which can be operative in the shells of atoms rather
            than in the nucleus. Holes and electrons (as pairs),
            electrically neutral, can certainly be trapped in shells.
            Complex structures, such as are obviously present, for
            example, in the rare earth atoms, may contain such dipole
            structures or concentric structures formed of electron-hole
            combinations. Photons (energy) could cause and maintain such
            dipole or concentric structures. Heat energy could therefore
            cause expansion by the effects of increasing the physical
            separation of these pairs and the resulting chasing action
            (primary Brownian movement) of such dipoles. </p>

          <p align="left">As described in the project submitted to
            DuPont, one method of beneficiating light gravitational
            isotopes is the centrifugal action upon materials floating
            in heavy liquids. To go into detail, the following may be
            said: </p>
          <p align="left">To beneficiate kaolinite (aluminum silicate,
            density 2.5), the finely ground material is floated upon an
            aqueous solution of thallium malonate-thallium formate
            adjusted to approx. 3.0 density (sp. gr.). </p>
          <p align="left">In a gravitational field, the material floats
            on the surface of the liquid, but in a strong centrifugal
            "field", the aluminum silicate particles having a low g/i
            ratio will sink. If the settlings are fixed, either by
            freezing or compaction, they may be removed en masse after
            the centrifuge has stopped. </p>

          <p align="left">To rate a centrifuge as so many "g’s" is
            obviously incorrect and basically unsound, if one is to
            distinguish between the effects of acceleration and
            gravitation. </p>
          <p align="left">One "g" is defined as that force (due to
            gravity) which will impact an acceleration to a mass
            equivalent to that experienced at the surface of the earth,
            i.e., approx. 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>. </p>
          <p align="left">Centrifugal force, on the other hand, depends
            upon inertial mass only and is in no way equivalent to the
            force of gravitation. </p>
          <p align="left">Three factors affect the rate of fall, or,
            more accurately, the acceleration of a free-falling body,
            (1) The intensity of the gravitational field or gradient,
            (2) the susceptibility of the material being acted upon by
            that field, and (3) the inertial mass of that material. </p>
          <p align="left">Obviously, and contrary to the currently
            accepted postulate of Relativity, all materials in nature do
            no react to the same extent to gravitation and, further, the
            weight-inertial mass ratio is not the same with all
            materials. </p>

            which will cause the acceleration of 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>
            under these circumstances is considered to be 1 "g". </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, we may refer to the ratio m<sub>g</sub>/m<sub>i</sub>,
            or simply the ratio g/i, as the "g-i" ratio. Under average
            conditions, when the ratio equals unity, there is said to be
            equivalence between weight and mass, as postulated by
            Einstein. However, when the "g-i" ratio is less than unity,
            the acceleration due to gravity is less and the acceleration
            in an inertial field is greater. When the ratio is greater
            than unity, the opposite appears to be true. </p>

          <p align="left">The g-i ratio represents the gravity-inertial
            property of a material. It differs with different materials
            and with the same materials at different times or under
            different states of excitation. </p>
          <p align="left">When the g-i ratio is unity, there is an exact
            equivalence of weight and inertial mass. This may be
            described as average or mean condition. </p>
          <p align="left">Certain materials in nature apparently have
            less or greater inertial mass for a given weight (under
            similar circumstances) and such materials therefore have a
            g-i ratio differing from unity. </p>
          <p align="left">A g-i ratio is said to be high, normal or low
            depending upon whether it is above unity, at unity or below
            unity, respectively. Light gravitational isotopes present
            predominantly in a mass tends to lower the g-i ratio. </p>

          <p align="left">If the material in the bulb has a g-i ratio
            greater than 1, the hydrometer bulb will rise in the liquid
            as the centrifugal force increases. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 41</i> </p>
          <p align="left">The reading of a floating hydrometer during
            centrifuging may be accomplished by using an indicator
            coating on the stem of the hydrometer, the color or shading
            of which changes when in contact with the liquid. Such an
            arrangement will permit reading the position (maximum) after
            the centrifuge has stopped and the hydrometer returned to
            zero position. </p>
          <p align="left">The method is useful in determining the g-i
            ratio of any unknown material, simply by placing a known
            amount in the bulb of a standardized form of hydrometer,
            using a liquid the g-i ratio of which is 1, and centrifuging
            at a known rate. These materials may be in liquid as well as
            solid sate. The sensitivity increases in proportion to the
            speed of the centrifuge. </p>
          <p align="left">The advantages of the hydrometer method of
            determining the g-i ratio of a material is that it is
            self-balancing and independent of the compaction of material
            during centrifuging. The hydrometer bulbs, since they are
            made of glass (a silicate), must be carefully checked and
            isotopically balanced to prevent a contribution to the
            reading. Change in geometry due to compression of the bulb
            must also be taken into account, but this may be balanced
            out and disregarded when liquids or semi-fluids are tested.

          <p align="left">Leesburg, VA, Feb 5, 1956. </p>
          <p align="left">Energy is required to create negative
            gravitational isotopes. This energy may be supplied in the
            form of protons (from infrared to gamma radiation) and
            conceivably also from high speed particles. </p>
          <p align="left">When applied to susceptible materials, this
            energy causes a temporary excited state, and this state
            accompanies a change in the g-i ratio to a lower value. </p>
          <p align="left">This excited state gradually deteriorates
            (probably according to a half-life curve) at different rates
            according to the material irradiated. The g-i ratio
            increases accordingly and approaches a value of 1
            asymptotically. During this decay, energy is released,
            mainly in the form of heat, and to a small extant, possibly
            also as visible light. </p>
          <p align="left">This evolution of energy at a high rate may
            not necessarily indicate a low gi ratio but more probably a
            high rate of decay, i.e., a short half-life, and to some
            extent also, a recent irradiation. The evolution of light
            (if it does occur) would immediately follow cessation of
            irradiation --- and, as a matter of fact, may be present
            during irradiation, for decay would be proceeding at the
            same time as irradiation. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 43</i> </p>
          <p align="left">The effect may be similar to photoexcitation
            of phosphors, the persistence of the radiation determined by
            the rate of decay of the excited state. </p>
          <p align="left">Immediately following removal of the exciting
            radiation, the luminescence and heating effect is greatest.
            The radiation diminishes as the excited state decays. </p>
          <p align="left">This suggests a beneficiated clay or other
            material which may be periodically excited and then
            (following irradiation) gives off heat slowly during the
            decay of the excited state. Thus such a material would serve
            as a heat reservoir with the energy stored as an
            electrogravitic excited state. </p>

          <p align="left">It is interesting speculation at this point to
            consider the possibility that certain desert sands and clays
            may thus become irradiated during the intense illumination
            of the day, and thus retain an ability to evolve heat
            through the night which exceeds the basic thermal capacity
            of the material. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 44</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Concurrent with the irradiation, the material
            may become gravitationally lighter and, at the same time,
            inertially more massive. </p>
          <p align="left">If there is a fraction of the irradiated
            desert sand or clay which is sufficiently susceptible, to
            the extent that the g-i ratio decreases to zero or goes
            negative, the particles comprising that fraction may
            actually rise (loft) until nightfall stops the irradiation.
            At which time, the particles may start to return to earth
            --- falling perhaps like micro-meteorites. </p>
          <p align="left">Needless to say, a collection of this material
            --- beneficiated in this way by nature --- would be
            susceptible again to the same radiation. If the natural
            radiation could be intensified by a quartz lens or metallic
            parabolic mirror and focused upon a small sample of highly
            susceptible material, the probability is that the material
            would quickly loft. This would provide a simple and
            effective confirmation. </p>
          <p align="left">Along this line, it has always been a mystery
            to me why magnetite is found frequently on top of sand at
            the waterline on beaches both in rivers and at the ocean. If
            it were merely that the sand had washed away, leaving the
            magnetite on top, an explanation might be provided. But, in
            many cases, the sand has been recently deposited and it is
            not clear how the magnetite can be carried along with the
            sand in the initial process of beach formation unless the
            densities were of the same order and/or unless the magnetite
            fell as micrometeorites during or subsequent to the
            formation of the beach. The density of average beach sand is
            2.5 gr/cm<sup>3</sup> while that of normal magnetite is 5.5
            gr/cm<sup>3</sup>, more than twice as heavy. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 45</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Magnetite found in beach sands may therefore
            be a susceptible material. It should be investigated. </p>
          <p align="left">The same may be said for loess. The beach sand
            deposits of monazite at Jacksonville Beach, FL are also
            interesting in this connection. </p>

            at this point is the possibility of natural beneficiation
            occurring on the surface of the moon. </p>
          <p align="left">Due to the slow rate of rotation of the moon,
            the moon’s daylight is approx. 14 days in length and night
            is also 14 days in length. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 46.</i> </p>
          <p align="left">During the long lunar day, temperatures rise
            well above 200-300° F in the surface materials. The
            radiation of the sun (due to the absence of atmosphere) is
            strong also in the ultraviolet. Conditions are sustained for
            14 days which are especially favorable for the excitation of
            photoisotopes. Lofting of susceptible fractions of surface
            dust is indicated. This material rises to great height and
            part of it may escape into space. If a positive space charge
            is created by the first waves of lofting material,
            electrostatic repulsive forces may slow up further lofting.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Assuming then, a continuing lofting and
            falling process, the moon’s surface may become covered with
            a fine dust which engages every lunar day in a
            lofting-falling cycle. </p>
          <p align="left">The surface then becomes covered with an
            especially deep layer at the end of the lunar night. This
            may be a rich deposit of photoisotopic material actually
            beneficiated by Nature. </p>
          <p align="left">The question, of course, may be asked if
            similar conditions exist or may be made to exist, upon the

          <p align="left">Leesburg, VA, Feb. 10, 1956. </p>
          <p align="left">A question presents itself as to the
            possibility that a highly energized body may transfer energy
            to a less energized body, either by conduction thru direct
            contact or by induction thru merely being in proximity. </p>
          <p align="left">Can, for example, a highly excited sand or
            clay energize rock? Can an excited gas (as in a positively
            charged fireball of nitrogen) excite the sand, gravel or
            other material by which it has been grounded and
            annihilated? Can the mere presence of contra-terrene
            material induce an effect of similar nature in a susceptible
            material? </p>
          <p align="left">Probably only experiment will reveal the
            answers. It is worth considering, however, for there are
            similar effects observable in other manifestations of energy
            --- such as heat, electrostatics, etc. </p>
          <p align="left">One immediately ponders the question as to
            energy excitation capacity, such as specific heat. Does a
            material of low specific (excitation) capacity transfer its
            energy to a material of higher excitation capacity, where
            there is only a slight difference in potential. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 49</i> </p>
          <p align="left">This would raise the question that materials
            may differ in excitation energy) capacity. Hence, more
            energy would be required to excite certain atoms (or
            materials generally) than others. More energy would be
            released, and hence the rate of evolution would be greater,
            or the rate of decay would be greater --- or possibly both.
          </p>
          <p align="left">A measure of potential must then be foreseen.
            Raising the potential from one value to another, multiplied
            by the specific capacity, would consume energy, as </p>
          <p align="left">E = P<sub>dif</sub> x capacity. </p>
          <p align="left">If then, a material of high capacity were to
            come into contact with a material of low capacity and would
            discharge thereinto, would the P reach a higher value in the
            second material? Based on analogous heat or electric
            situations, the answer would seem to be that the potential
            governs the flow, not the capacity. </p>
          <p align="left">Therefore, if a transfer of energy takes
            place, it is because a difference in potential exists.
            Energy will flow until the potential is equalized. </p>
          <p align="left">In energizing a material of high capacity, a
            flow similar to the electric charging of a storage battery
            takes place, with the potential rising as the charging
            continues. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 50</i> </p>
          <p align="left">If the g-i ratio is a measure of excitation
            potential, then I must be in reciprocal relation. As an
            arbitrary zero, the g-i ratio of 1 can be taken. The
            excitation potential increases as the ratio decreases to
            zero. It continues to increase as the ratio goes negative.
            Let us divide the scale so that the distance from 1 to zero
            is 100 units. The distance from zero to –1 is then also 100
            units, As: --- </p>
          <p align="left">Excitation Potential // g-i&nbsp; ratio </p>
          <p align="left">200 units // -1 <br>
            100 " // 0 <br>
            0 " // +1 </p>
          <p align="left">Therefore, in summary, a material will have
            mass-weight equivalence at zero potential, weightlessness
            and double mass (or some larger exponent) at 100 units and
            lofting at 1g and some still larger inertial mass at 200
            units of excitation. </p>
          <p align="left">To excite a material, the energy (photon)
            equivalent of the excitation potential required must be
            supplied. In effect, this is electromagnetic excitation.
            This excitation must be continued for a length of time
            determined by the excitation capacity of the material. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 51</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Just as in charging a storage battery, a
            longer time is required or a greater flow to charge a
            material of higher capacity. </p>
          <p align="left">Once charged, a material of higher capacity
            will continue in the excited state until discharged, and
            will last longer or discharge at a higher rate, or both. </p>
          <p align="left">If there is a difference in capacity of
            materials, it is logical to assume, at least to start with,
            that the capacity may be a direct function of the inertial
            mass at zero potential or grav. mass at any potential. </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, to irradiate a rare earth metal or
            tantalum would require more energy than aluminum or silicon,
            but the radiated energy during decay would likewise be
            greater. When once energized to a given potential, tantalum
            would give off more energy during decay to zero potential
            and would do so at a greater rate or for a longer time, or
            both. </p>
          <p align="left">Aluminum silicate could be excited to a given
            potential with less energy because its excitation capacity
            is less. </p>
          <p align="left">Now therefore, on the basis that the specific
            excitation is less than that of tantalum, it is clear that
            the decay radiation total will be different to the same
            extent. </p>
          <p align="left">Tantalum will absorb more energy and give off
            more energy in reaching the same excitation potential. The
            rate of charging will depend (1) upon the potential of the
            charging source and (2) upon the rate of charging (or flow).
          </p>
          <p align="left">Therefore, to return to the subject of this
            reaction, the rate of flow (conductivity) may depend upon
            the proximity and/or contact with the charging source. </p>
          <p align="left">If, for example, two pieces of tantalum having
            been differently excited (that is at presently different
            potentials) were brought into contact, energy would most
            certainly flow from one to the other. The flow would cease
            when their potentials balanced. This would constitute
            contact excitation of one by the other. </p>
          <p align="left">If highly excited aluminum silicate were
            placed in an envelope or container made of tantalum, contact
            would tend to cause the excitation of the tantalum, but the
            difference in the specific capacity would be so great as to
            virtually discharge the aluminum silicate without
            effectively draining the potential of the tantalum, unless,
            of course, the volume of aluminum silicate makes up for the
            difference in specific capacity. </p>
          <p align="left">On the other hand, highly excited tantalum
            could energize a large quantity of aluminum silicate without
            an appreciable drop in potential of the tantalum. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 53</i> </p>
          <p align="left">One may speculate then that excitation in this
            respect is contagious from one element to the other, that
            there may be a variation from element to element, (1) in
            capacity, (2) in rates of spontaneous decay. </p>
          <p align="left">The more interesting elements, therefore, are
            those which have reasonably high capacity and very slow
            rates of decay. </p>

            motion. It is this force which ma account for the basic
            orbital velocity (given in Sec. 26). </p>
          <p align="left">However, since the actual velocity of the
            Earth surface is the result of both orbital and axial
            rotation, the forces actually acting are as follows: </p>

            that indicated in Sec. 26, and we must look elsewhere for
            the counter-rotational torque. </p>
          <p align="left">It would appear at the moment that we must
            look elsewhere for this effect, and probably the most
            fruitful place to look would be in the solar-tidal friction
            produced upon and within the body of the Earth (including
            the oceans) as it revolves. </p>
          <p align="left">Such friction would increase quite rapidly as
            the rate of rotation increases, hence would soon reach an
            equilibrium revolution at a certain rate. </p>
          <p align="left">We can assume, I believe, that this
            equilibrium (in the case of the Earth) has been reached. </p>

          <p align="left">In Sec. 27, axial rotation plus irradiation
            caused orbital motion. </p>
          <p align="left">Obviously, there is an interaction between all
            three factors, so that an equilibrium condition exists for
            all values of irradiation. </p>
          <p align="left">It is apparent that, in the foregoing, orbital
            motion per se is not required. What is required is that the
            relative position of the source of irradiation shall not
            change with respect to the body being irradiated. Hence to
            maintain a fixed relative position, orbital motion satisfies
            this requirement. </p>
          <p align="left">At any instant, therefore, orbital motion is
            equivalent to linear motion. </p>
          <p align="left">A summary of the situation, therefore, points

          <p align="left">An improvement over the use of highly
            conducting metals as antennae (see pat. Appl. On subject)
            appears to present itself in the photoisotopic cell (See
            Sec. 12). </p>
          <p align="left">In Sec. 29 and 30, the effect of changing
            inertial mass was set forth. This is in accord with the law
            of conservation of momentum. This calls for a change in
            velocity according to the equation for kinetic energy E = ½
            mV<sup>2</sup>. </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, for a given momentum </p>

          <p align="left"><i>m</i> being inertial mass as distinguished
            from gravitational mass (m<sub>g</sub>). </p>
          <p align="left">Any modulating inertial mass (mi) must exert a
            force during the time of change tending to increase or
            decrease its absolute velocity. As stated in Sec. 30, the
            direction of this force must be toward or away from the
            exact direction of its absolute motion (in space). </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, if an antenna (of an electro-gravitic
            radio transmitter) is electrically or photo-isotopically
            modulated, it will tend to vibrate mechanically in the
            alignment of its absolute motion. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 63</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Conversely, one may look for the generation of
            an alternating potential if such a mass is vibrated in the
            alignment of its absolute motion (in space). </p>
          <p align="left">Since the velocity enters the equation with
            /as an experiment, it is possible that the voltage may turn
            out to be a function of the absolute velocity, but this will
            be discussed in a later chapter. </p>

            increases, absolute motion should be decreased, hence a

            When it moves to A, its rate of decrease of velocity is
            maximum. During this decrease of V, a positive charge
            appears, being a function of the rate. Similarly during the
            increase of V a negative charge appears, equal in magnitude
            to the rate at which the equivalent mass m<sub>i</sub> is
            decreasing. </p>

          <p align="left">Leesburg, VA; April 7, 1956. </p>
          <p align="left">In the dynamic phase of the electrogravitic
            interaction, the force developed by a system of electric
            dipoles is believed to vary with the rate-of-change of the
            voltage between the dipoles. </p>
          <p align="left">This force, independent of the movement of
            ions or any mechanical reaction therefrom, operates in the
            direction of negative-to-positive as the voltage is
            increasing, and, presumably, in the opposite direction as
            the voltage is decreasing. </p>
          <p align="left">In vacuum (10<sup>-6</sup> mm Hg or less), an
            interesting effect is observed. </p>
          <p align="left">Any simple vacuum capacitor will appear to
            flash as the voltage increases, and, concurrent with the
            vacuum spark, an impulse force is noted in the direction of
            the negative to positive. It is noted that the wave shape is
            as follows: </p>

          </div>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 76</i> </p>
          <p align="left">According to theory, the impulse is associated
            with the recovery of potential and not with the rapid
            decrease brought on by the vacuum spark. </p>
          <p align="left">Two possibilities present themselves in
            explanation: (1) the decrease in potential is too rapid to
            produce an observable force mechanically, or (2) a balancing
            effect serving to prevent the force from being created may
            be present in the k-mu (ether) medium. </p>
          <p align="left">Therefore, since the downward voltage produces
            no force, the upward voltage is responsible for the observed
            force. </p>
          <p align="left">There is evidence to support the belief that a
            local balancing effect actually exists in the k-mu medium or
            field between or surrounding the electrodes, in that the
            effect is primarily observed when the voltage change is
            caused by a vacuum spark or flash between the electrodes and
            not when wholly due to a chopper in the external circuit. </p>
          <p align="left">The principal movement of the dipoles is
            therefore always associated with (and probably caused by)
            the vacuum spark or flash. </p>

                related to the initiation of an electrogravitic impulse.</i></b><a name="43"></a> </p>
          <p align="left">The vacuum spark is apparently not due to a
            flow of electrons, although a flow of electrons may
            accompany the discharge. </p>
          <p align="left">Initiation of the "flash", as it is called
            from observations in the dark, appear to be related to anode
            conditions such as shape (field intensity) and the metal
            comprising the anode. In a recently evacuated system,
            flashing starts at a comparatively low voltage, 30-40 KV. It
            becomes less frequent at this low range and then ceases
            altogether. A higher voltage is then required --- 50 to 60
            KV, which causes a succession of flashes which, in turn,
            cease. At 80-90 KV, flashing is intense for a time, but
            finally ceases. At 130-140 KV, the flashing is quite intense
            and cease only after a considerable time. It is believed
            that a threshold may be reached between 150-200 KV where
            flashing will be sustained and continuous. </p>
          <p align="left">The electrogravitic forces developed by the
            rapid succession of impulses which accompany the flashing in
            the higher voltage ranges is indeed a first order effect,
            measurable in thousands of dynes, even with small scale
            equipment. </p>
          <p align="left">While the nature of the flash (or its cause)
            is not wholly understood, it is reasonable a this stage to
            suspect positive conduction, at least as the initiator.
            Emission from the anode, bombarding the cathode, may (and
            probably does) release electrons which contribute to the
            electrical conduction. Since the effect takes place in very
            high vacuum, it is unlikely that atmospheric ions or the
            like are involved. Occluded atoms or molecules are probably
            pulled from the anode material, and these, of course, may be
            oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, or any of the atmospheric gases.
            Metallic ions of the anode material may be involved, or
            perhaps even microscopic pieces of metal. </p>
          <p align="left">One of the spectacular features of the flash
            is the colored luminescence which appears on or immediately
            adjacent to the anode and/or the shifting areas of light and
            color across the face of the anode. The color is reddish ---
            like hot metal, although in reality the surface is not hot:
            Cadmium is especially active in this respect although other
            metals reveal the same red coloration. White star-like spots
            of considerable brilliance appear on the cathode. </p>

          <p align="left">The mechanism of dust storms, where wind
            causes fine particles of sand or clay to rub over one
            another for a considerable distance may be responsible for a
            temporary loss of weight. The same effect may be present
            under water where the current causes sand to flow to and fro
            (as in wave actions) or straightway (as in rivers). </p>
          <p align="left">Due to the presence of sunlight irradiation,
            the phenomena of "rising" sand wind long noticed in the
            Sahara may be evidence of the above effect. Sand grains
            rubbing over other sand grains, by saltation, by the action
            of the wind, may cause the more susceptible grains to rise
            en masse and actually to loft to a considerable height,
            higher than they would normally go under the action of wind
            alone. </p>

          <p align="left">All methods of recording music, sounds or
            time-series data, up to the present, have required the use
            of elements which are electrically or mechanically moving at
            a constant rate. </p>
          <p align="left">The phonograph is a classic example. Here,
            sounds are translated into mechanical vibrations which are
            recorded in a wax plate or equivalent which is moving at a
            constant rate. The magnetic tape or wire recorder is
            similar, except that magnetic variations are impresses upon
            the moving element. </p>
          <p align="left">In computing machines so-called electronic
            brains, memory devices are employed for the storage of data.
            These may be in the form of magnetic wire or tape records
            or, if greater speeds are required, mercury (transducer)
            memory tubes or television-like sustained images. Memory
            tubes require a recirculating sonic or ultrasonic path
            wherein the data is stored, and the cathode ray systems
            require continuous rescanning systems. Such recirculating or
            rescanning systems require a continuing source of energy in
            order to preserve the data indefinitely. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 87</i> </p>
          <p align="left">It is suggested that a kind of memory may be
            inherent in the dielectric materials under certain
            conditions, so that, in effect, they may remember the manner
            of recharging. It appears possible that such memory may
            persist as long as the charge is retained. </p>
          <p align="left">The same characteristic may be present in
            certain magnetic materials and in a fashion which may be

            to explore these possibilities. </p>

            experiments conducted at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard in 1950-51.
            These preliminary experiments gave positive results,
            indicating a real shift of the mid-points with respect to
            each other with time. </p>
          <p align="left">Successive tests over an extended period of

            continuing (sometimes gradual and sometimes abrupt) circuit

          <p align="left">It is thought that this phenomena relates to
            the action of the so-called sidereal radiation electrometer

          <p align="left">In Sec. 15, it was suggested that

            development of this idea is as follows: </p>
          <p align="left">When the charge of a mass (according to
            electrogravitic theory) is made more negative, the mass
            becomes exogravitic during the interval of change. The
            exogravitic rate is a function of the rate of change of the
            electric charge. </p>
          <p align="left">Similarly, when the charge changes in he
            positive direction, the mass becomes endogravitic during the

            until it potential balances the incoming potential
            (expressed in millighos). The electrogravitic capacity or
            retentiveness then determines the persistence of the effect.
          </p>
          <p align="left">During excitation, the higher millighos value
            should accompany the loss of weight. The interesting feature
            seems to be that the excited state acts like a heated state
            thermally and that it may represent another kind of "heat",
            engaging in conduction, radiation, and temperature
            equilibrium. </p>
          <p align="left">Conductivity of gravitic excitation through a
            material may differ markedly from one material to another.
            It is suggested that certain basalts, lavas and clays,
            perhaps also gravitic materials, silicas and some of the
            rare earth metals and tantalum may be found susceptible and
            useful in this connection. </p>
          <p align="left">High voltages (discharges in air) may produce
            the effect, especially where the voltages and momentary
            currents are very high as in a lightning bolt. A solid or
            gas which is near ground potential is suddenly struck by
            positive ions and rapidly moving dust particles. The result
            could be gravitic excitation of the solid or gas. It is
            conceivable that atmospheric nitrogen should be so excited
            --- producing the so-called ball-of-fire which has been
            observed to glow and to drift around like a toy balloon. See
            Sec. 4, Test No.2. </p>
          <p align="left">It is interesting to speculate also that the
            ""Brown Mountain Lights" may be caused by intense
            atmospheric electric gradients, with the ground negatively
            charged. </p>
          <p align="left">The light of the aurora may, in part at least,
            be due to the bombardment of crystal nitrogen by positive
            particles from the sun. An investigation of the luminosity
            of crystal nitrogen under positive rays may be in order. </p>

            scout ship and in the descriptive material pertaining to it
            found in the Adamski publication, the central pylon is
            referred to as place where energy is stored for the
            propulsion of the ship. It is stated that this central
            column must be recharged (by the mother ship), presumably as
            a storage battery is recharged. </p>
          <p align="left">The implication is that te central pylon is a
            kind of storage capacitor for electrostatic energy or
            perhaps even a pile of high capacity electret wafers serving
            the same purpose --- the stored energy being in the electric
            form (simple electrostatic nature). </p>
          <p align="left">To retain sufficient energy, if such a storage
            column is simply electrical, very high K materials and very
            high voltages would be required. Such high electrical fields
            would be difficult to contain without adequate insulation,
            especially thru the cabin compartment. Even with the very
            highest K materials available now (say 10,000 to 30,000 K),
            it is unbelievable that enough electrical energy would be
            stored to provide the propulsion and dynamic counterbary
            required. </p>
          <p align="left">It appears necessary therefore, to look
            further into the nature of the energy storage means. The

            may be formed to remain at some high value positive as a
            permanent state --- at least until the gravitic dipole is
            discharged or decays to zero. In this respect, the column is
            an electric (as well as gravitic) dipole when it is charged
            and the energy resides both as electric storage and gravitic
            excitation. Most of the energy in storage, however, would be
            represented as the gravitic excitation of the lower end. The

          <p align="left">Winston-Salem, NC; Jan 5, 1958. </p>
          <p align="left">In connection with the gravitic excitation of
            materials, luminescence of the material itself as well as
            the surrounding materials (or gases) seems reasonable
            indeed. This is the type of thing one would expect if he
            were to attempt to account for the glow around soaucers
            hovering or in flight, as reported by so many observers. </p>
          <p align="left">Nothing, of course, of this nature has as yet
            been observed in the laboratory, and it is pure speculation
            as to its color and general behavior or even its existence.
            However, one may be able to foretell some of the properties.
          </p>
          <p align="left">In general, the radiation may be similar to
            tribo-luminescence, may actually be associated with
            tribo-luminescence, since friction also produces
            counterbary. Where gravitic excitation is carried to higher
            values, say 1 gho or above, considerable energy is in
            storage. Such energy undoubtedly would be found to have some
            have some radiant manifestation, since there would exist a
            steep gradient in the surrounding field. This gradient would
            dominate with the square of the distance. It would be
            greatest, therefore, immediately adjacent to the excited
            body, and especially around sharp points or edges where the
            field is steep. The effect may be similar, therefore, to
            electrical discharge (corona), may be present along with
            electrical corona and may, in some respects, be
            indistinguishable form it. Hence, saucers may glow from
            gravitic corona or electric corona or both. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 108.</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In atmospheric air, electric corona is of
            purple color. A breakdown spark is blue. These spectral
            characteristics have been studied in great detail in the
            laboratory, along with the spectra of other gases (and
            solids) under electric bombardment or excitation. </p>
          <p align="left">Gravitic luminescence may come directly from
            the emitting surface or from the surrounding gas as gravitic
            corona. The spectra may be entirely different from electric
            corona, and more than likely it is quite different. </p>
          <p align="left">For example, on the basis of electric corona,
            it is difficult to account for the oft-reported flame-red
            color noted in saucers in flight. It is equally difficult to
            explain the shift in color from blue-white to flame-red, as
            the saucer maneuvers. These colors are not found in simple
            electric corona in air, and a change in voltage would not
            cause a change in color. </p>
          <p align="left">The flame-red color, therefore, is a stranger
            insofar as electric corona discharge is concerned. It is
            possible that this color is typical of gravitic corona </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 109</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In atmospheric air, at higher gravitic
            excitations or field strengths, the red color may become
            orange, orange-white, white or blue. This suggests the
            possibility of a continuous spectrum type of radiation
            similar to heat (thermo-luminescence). </p>
          <p align="left">This would mean, then, that the lower end of
            the dipole (column) shown on Page 106 would glow visibly
            when sufficiently excited by the spray of positive ions.
            Starting from a dull red, the luminescence might increase
            both in intensity and frequency (from red to blue) as the
            gravitic excitation continues. In this way, the nature
            (intensity and color) of the luminescence might be a
            convenient indicator of the degree of gravitic excitation.
            In other words, the color would reveal the amount of static
            counterbary as well as the gravitic excitation or total
            stored energy. </p>
          <p align="left">A gravitic dipole (as shown in p. 106) would
            appear luminous at the lower end but not a the upper end. At
            max. excitation, the color gradation would range from blue
            (at the lower end) thru white, orange-violet, orange, red
            and dull red to black (no radiation at the top). </p>
          <p align="left">The flame-red radiation would not necessarily
            be hot (thermally) in itself or represent a thermally hot
            surface. It would, however, represent a source of high
            energy or the storage of that energy (as gravitic potential)
            in matter. </p>

          <p align="left">It is a basic requirement in shaping the
            electric field (p. 98) that the electric lines converge upon
            the cathode (as in Case No. 1). This normally requires a
            small cathode for high flux fields. Where a central pylon is
            used (as in p. 104 and 106), the high flux must be
            concentrated at the lower (cathode) end. A type of electrode
            is therefore suggested which accomplishes such field
            shaping. It is the toroid. </p>

            more evenly thru the pylon. Between these extremes, it could

          <p align="left">It is apparent that some form of
            gyro-stabilization would assist the Venusian scout ship in
            maintaining course, and preventing wobble, both while
            hovering and while in flight. Such stabilization may be
            accomplished by rotating the cathode-toroid in one direction
            and the control grid in the opposite direction. The main
            body of the ship would then not be subject to rotational
            forces. </p>
          <p align="left">It is assumed that the 3-ball system for
            horizontal stability control (canting) would not rotate and
            would be used to set the basic direction of flight and

          <p align="left">Rotation of the toroid (containing the power
            coil) and the control grid can be achieved by the
            electromagnetic coupling between the magnetic and electric
            fields. Forces applied and hence the angular moments would
            be equal and opposite between the two oppositely rotating
            members. Speed of rotation would be a function of the
            current and the magnetic field. If the current for the
            dynamic counterbary passes also through the toroidal coil.
            The rotation would be controlled entirely by the current, as
            created by the voltage on the control grid. </p>

          <p align="left">Winston-Salem, NC; Jan. 13, 198. </p>
          <p align="left">There appears to be good reason to speculate
            at this time upon the effects attending high differences of
            gravitational (gravitic) potential If the potential gradient
            is exceedingly high (high flux density), the large energy
            difference would, it seems, attempt to energize itself.
            Thus, a kind of energy flow would be created from the high
            potential region o the low potential region. If the distance
            were small, this flow would be intense and undoubtedly would
            manifest itself in many curious ways. </p>
          <p align="left">Such a flow of energy we shall hereafter call
            "dielectricity". </p>
          <p align="left">Dielectricity would, therefore, be present
            more or less in every situation where there is a
            gravitational gradient. Its vector of flow would always be
            from the higher to the lower gravitational potential. </p>
          <p align="left">The situation is analogous to the flow of
            electricity (in the classical sense) from the positive to
            the negative potential or from the higher to the lower
            electrical potential. </p>
          <p align="left">Undoubtedly, such a flow of dielectricity
            would possess many interesting parallels to a flow of
            electricity. Both would represent a flow of energy from a
            higher to a lower potential. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 115</i> </p>
          <p align="left">It is interesting to speculate upon the nature
            of the materials capable of conducting dielectricity and
            what materials might serve as insulators. One finds not only
            an analogy to electricity but also to heat, but the analogy
            with heat may be close in some respects (as in the
            conductivity or temperature distribution along a wire) and
            not in other respects as in phenomena arising from
            resistance to the flow. Resistance to the passage of current
            (flow) in electricity transforms the potential difference
            into heat. What happens when there is resistance to he flow
            of dielectricity, we can only guess. </p>
          <p align="left">Suppose, after we find a material capable of
            conducting dielectricity, we form it into a coil. What do we
            have generated in the place of a magnetic field? --- or is
            it a magnetic field? </p>
          <p align="left">What takes place when two plates of high
            gravitational potential are close together? Is there
            repulsion, as in static electricity? </p>
          <p align="left">And what if the plates have a high difference
            in gravitational (gravitic) potential? Is there attraction?
            And is there, in this case, a high flux density and a
            storage of energy in the space between the plates, acting
            like a capacitor? Is the energy stored in such a capacitor,
            and resident in the space between the plates, gravitational
            or something one step further. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 116</i> </p>
          <p align="left">One may define a gravitational potential as a
            "pressure". The gradient between a high potential (high
            pressure) region in space and a low potential (low pressure)
            region is manifested as a gravity field (or just "g"). The
            vectors of this g-field are identical to the dielectric
            field vectors and both represent forces. </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, one would be led to believe that a flow
            of dielectricity, if resisted, would cause a force upon the
            body of the conductor --- much like the resistance to the
            flow of water against the walls of a tube through which it
            is flowing. </p>
          <p align="left">In the case of a gravitic (or dielectric)
            conductor, the factor creating resistance is gravitational
            reluctance (opposite to gravitational permeance or
            permeability). Such gravitational reluctance in the
            conductor of dielectricity would cause a force in the
            direction of the flow. In space, this force is simply
            gravity. Hence, it would appear that gravitational
            reluctance is created by (or equivalent to) gravitational
            mass M<sub>g</sub> (as distinguished from inertial mass M<sub>i</sub>.
          </p>
          <p align="left">The quality of conductivity of dielectricity
            is the opposite of gravitational reluctance, hence it is
            lack of Mg. Theoretically, a vacuum (complete absence of
            ponderable mater) is the best conductor. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 117</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Conversely, ponderable matter of highest Mg
            represents a conductor of the greatest gravitational
            reluctance (resistance) and is therefore the best insulator
            of dielectricity. </p>
          <p align="left">This is virtually the opposite of the
            situation regarding the conductor of electricity --- hence
            the designation, "di-electricity". </p>
          <p align="left">Summarizing then: </p>
          <p align="left">Electricity --- conducted by metals, insulated
            by vacuum <br>
            Dielectricity --- conducted by vacuum, insulated by metals.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Curiously, and this does indeed seem strange,
            the best insulator for the prevention of flow (loss in the
            central pylon (p. 106) is its weight (Mg). As a gravitic
            dipole with high potential at its lower end (cathode), the
            highest resistance would be provided by large values of Mg;
            this resistance causing an upward or lifting force in the
            transformation of the stored energy to motion and finally to
            heat resulting from resistance to that motion. </p>

            insulators dividing the pylon into sections of increasing

          <p align="left">In Sec 65, I speculated upon the existence of
            high-gravitic potential differences and upon a flow
            resulting from such potential differences. In many respects
            such a flow would be analogous to the flow of electricity
            (or current). The flow arising from a difference in gravitic
            potential might be termed "dielectric current", in that it
            would presumably be conducted by dielectrics. </p>
          <p align="left">If one subscribed to the idea of an ether,
            such a flow could be viewed as a movement of the ether. The
            flow, of necessity, would be circulatory, creating one or
            more vortices. </p>
          <p align="left">It was pointed out that materials may offer
            varying amounts of resistance to such a flow, thus giving
            rise to a force of ponderomotive nature acting upon the
            interposed material. Such a force may conceivably be similar
            to, or perhaps indistinguishable from, the force of gravity.
          </p>
          <p align="left">The flow of dielectricity, whether or not it
            is responsible for gravity, results from a field in which
            there is a difference in potential --- not electric, but
            attending and usually created by an electric field. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 127</i> </p>
          <p align="left">In Fig 2, the flow again is from the region of
            highest to lowest flux density, hence from the point
            electrode in the center to the toroidal electrode around it,
            and returning axially, as indicated. </p>
          <p align="left">Assuming the arcuate surface (in Fig 1) or the
            toroidal surface (in Fig 2) to have a gravitic (or
            dielectric) potential at or near the ambient, I is the
            center electrode which has the high gravitic potential ---
            at least, insofar as the generation of dielectricity is
            concerned. </p>

          <p align="left">In the foregoing section, the generator of
            so-called dielectricity was discussed. It was pointed out
            that a flow could be created by a non-linear electric
            gradient and that the direction of that flow would be from
            the region of highest electric flux density to the region of
            lowest flux density. </p>
          <p align="left">In other words, a difference of potential is
            created which is not expressible in terms of electricity but
            which flows if a return circuit is provided. The flow does
            not necessarily follow a path o electrical conductivity
            (such as a wire) but arches through the environment in the
            manner of a magnetic field. </p>
          <p align="left">Preliminary experiments have indicated that
            the flow prefers glass or plastics as a path, hence,
            exhibits the characteristics of a flow capable of
            conduction. Since the materials revealing such conductivity
            are generally dielectrics, the entity comprising the flow
            has been named "dielectricity". </p>
          <p align="left">In summary, therefore, "dielectricity" may be
            defined as "an entity capable of flowing" which is "placed
            in motion" by a non-linear electric gradient and which flows
            from the region of high electric flux density (by the
            shortest route) to the region of lowest flux density, thence
            returning by an exterior circuit formed by materials which
            do not necessarily conduct electricity. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 130</i> </p>
          <p align="left">If the behavior of such a flow is similar to
            that of magnetism or electricity, it is to be expected that
            an increase in conductivity of the circuit elements (or
            conversely, a decrease in resistance) will result in an
            increase in the flow itself. For example, in a magnetic
            circuit the more of the circuit which contains iron, the
            greater is the magnetic flux density. This is usually
            expressed as a decrease in the air gap. The factor
            introduced is the integrated mu for all sections of the
            magnetic circuit. </p>
          <p align="left">In the present instance, where we may be
            talking about a dielectric phenomenon and a flow of
            dielectricity, the integrated K may be the factor which is
            significant. On the other hand, if the characteristics of
            the flow of dielecticity or the results of a difference in
            potential of dielectricity are gravitational, then the
            significant factor may be m<sub>g</sub> or the gravitational
            mass of the circuit sections. If both are involved, as
            perhaps an electromagnetic phenomenon, then both K and Mg
            are important factors in the circuit. The final answer to
            this question cannot be given until precise tests of various
            materials can be completed. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 131</i> </p>
          <p align="left">One characteristic of the flow of dieletricity
            appears to be its ability to create a force on the material
            through which it is slowing. It may be said that it was
            largely through the indications of its forceful effects that
            its presence was initially detected. In practically every
            experiment where a flow of dielectricity is established, an
            air flow results in the direction of the flux. In the
            beginning, the air flow was so pronounced that it was
            difficult to purify the results so as to eliminate what
            appeared to be the effects of an "electric wind". </p>
          <p align="left">It is to be noted that the classical concept
            of electric wind is perhaps inseparably confused and
            inter-related to the effects of a flow of dielectricity. Any
            electrified point, according to classical concepts, produces
            ions of the same sign as the point and hence are repelled by
            the point, producing a motion of the medium when their
            momentum is transferred to that medium. It is assumed that
            the reaction, resulting from the repulsion of the ions from
            the point, will drive the point in the opposite direction
            and that this reaction will be exactly equal and opposite to
            the forward momentum of the wind. </p>

          <p align="left">A simple experiment will reveal that this is
            not necessarily true: </p>

            shown. Measured only on the two electrodes. </p>
          <p align="left">In the above experiment, only by considering
            the forces acting on the medium to the side of the alignment
            of electrodes (which are in a direction from right-to-left)
            will the net force (as indicated) be eliminated. </p>
          <p align="left">It is obvious that the classical concept of
            the electric wind does not explain a movement of the medium
            from right to left (in the above explanation). </p>
          <p align="left">On the other hand, the classical concept
            explains the left-to-right momentum but cannot explain the
            lack of balance which causes the net force as indicated. </p>
          <p align="left">In Sec 70. it was shown that a flow of
            dielectricity probably results from any situation in which
            there is a no-linear electric flux density. </p>

          <p align="left">In the illustration on the previous page,
            there is a strong non-linear gradient on the electric field
            between the sharp point and the large arcuate electrode. The
            greatest density exists around the end of the point and
            falls of to a minimum at the arcuate electrode. </p>
          <p align="left">Hence, according to the principles set forth
            in Sec. 70, a flow of dielectricity is created by such a

            toroidal vortex as the structure (geometry) of the
            electrodes permits. The resistance of the fluid to the flow
            of dielectricity results in a movement of the fluid. That
            part of the flow which impinges upon the electrodes tends to
            move the electrode system. Hence, the electrodes (in the
            illustration) tend to move upward while fluid, particularly
            near the periphery of the electrodes, tends to move
            downward. </p>

          <p align="left">The conductivity is so great that virtually no
            flow appears externally. </p>
          <p align="left">Due to the partial closing of the air gap by
            high conducting material, the flux density is greatly
            increased. This increase in flow of dielectricity will cause
            an increase in the lift of the electrode system within the
            enclosure. The downward flow through the walls of the
            enclosure will, however, be sufficient to virtually balance
            the lift if the electrode system is mechanically attached to
            the metal enclosure. </p>
          <p align="left">In other words, placing the electrode system
            within the can greatly increases the lift of the electrode
            system by itself. But, a force virtually of the same
            magnitude and opposite in sense is created within the walls
            of the can, by reason of the resistance to the flow offered
            by these surfaces or (perhaps more correctly) these volumes
            of upper high-K materials. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 136</i> </p>
          <p align="left">No secondary flow patterns are established
            outside of the can due to the ability of the metal walls to
            conduct all of the flow of electricity. </p>
          <p align="left">The effect is similar to the ability of iron
            cores (of high magnetic permeability) to convey all the
            magnetic flux, allowing the establishment of no flux
            outside. This will, of course, be true up to the point of
            saturation, where a further increase in flux cannot be
            carried and leaks out into the surrounding space. </p>
          <p align="left">When saturation to the flow of dielectricity
            has been reached, the flux which leaks out causes secondary
            flows or "reversed" vortices, as: </p>

          <p align="left">The friction of the moving air both inside and
            outside the container (upon the walls of the container) then
            causes the can to move downward, while the air farther away

          <p align="left">In this way, an electrode system encased in an
            enclosure where the flux density is beyond saturation (as
            with a Saran sheet enclosure), the force acting upon the
            system appears to be reversed. </p>
          <p align="left">Increasing the thickness of the Saran or by
            using dielectrics of greater conductivity of dielectricity,

          <p align="left">In the foregoing experiment, the electrode
            system is suspended for lift measurement within a Saran bag.
            Complete reversal of force, due to saturation, is observed,
            and the entire rig possesses a force downward. </p>
          <p align="left">If then, the rig is placed in a metal can, a
            complete reversal to lift may be observed for small diameter
            metal cans. The force downward will persist in larger
            diameter metal cans. A size of metal can, between these two
            extremes, may be found where no force exists. This null will
            represent the balance between the primary flow which
            penetrates the Saran bag and the secondary flow created by
            the saturated bag. </p>
          <p align="left">Another experiment which is suggested to test
            the saturation theory is the use of multiple layers of
            Saran, each layer contributing to the flux conductivity,
            whereby the addition of each layer reduces the reversed
            force a given amount, finally increasing the conductivity to
            the point below saturation (for that particular voltage)
            where the force is zero. At that voltage, the flux (being
            fully conducted) produces no force. At a slightly higher
            voltage, the flux being greater, is not fully conducted by
            the now saturated Saran sheets, and hence gives rise to a
            reversed force due to the secondary or exterior vortex. </p>

            the armature in position yet permit limited vertical (axial)
            movement. The device may be studied at high voltages either
            in vacuum or under oil. </p>

          <p align="left">When electrical energy is supplied to either
            or both members, motion results. </p>
          <p align="left">If one or the other member is energized, and
            mechanical motion is supplied, an electric current in the
            second member will be generated. Such current will vary in
            accordance with the motion. Hence, the device will operate
            as a vibration pickup or microphone as well as an
            oscillating force generator or loudspeaker element. </p>
          <p align="left">Also, where all electrical conditions are
            rigorously constant, the force will vary according to the
            flux density. If such flux density within a closed system
            such as this varies with a linear, solar or sidereal diurnal
            pattern, such pattern will show upon a suitable force
            recorder operating for time-series observation. </p>

          <p align="left">In all of the experimental work to date, the
            results which have led to the concept of dielectricity and
            dielectric flux have carried one characteristic in common
            --- i.e, force or motion exerted upon dielectric solids or
            fluids. </p>
          <p align="left">In general, the source of the dielectricity or
            dielectromotance possesses a force in one direction whereas
            the balance of the circuit exhibits a force in the opposite
            direction, as: </p>

            </center>
          </div>
          <p align="left">If the return circuit is in air, oil or other
            dielectric fluid, the force results in movement of the
            fluid. In many cases where the electrodes are charged with
            respect to the medium, the flow may be mistaken for electric
            wind. It is usually quite difficult to separate these
            effects. </p>
          <p align="left">Any highly electrified point produces ions
            which are repelled from the point, giving rise to a motion
            in the medium known as electric wind. </p>
          <p align="left">In the same structure, the non-linear electric
            gradient outward from the point constitutes a
            dielectromotance and gives rise to a flow of the medium
            outward from the point ad in the direction of the decreasing
            flux density. Hence, the so-called electric wind may in fact
            be a total of the two effects. See p. 142 (1). </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Page 147</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Only by creating a dielectric potential
            difference where there is no electric potential difference,
            can the pure dielectric wind be separated from the electric
            wind. This is possible, it would appear, in the following
            structure: </p>

          <p align="left">In these circuits, two dielectromoances are
            connected in series, and the dielectric potential difference
            is doubled. The flow is in the closed circuit as indicated.
