      <p>Walkertown, NC; Aug 23, 1958 </p>
      <p>Referring to Jean’s <i>Mathematical Theory of Electricity and
          Magnetism</i>, p. 177, an electric field consists of the
        following stresses in the dielectric medium: </p>
      <p>(1) a tension KR<sup>2</sup> / 8 pi per unit area in the
        direction of the lines of force; </p>
      <p>(2) a pressure KR<sup>2</sup> / 8 pi per nit area perpendicular
        to the lines of force; </p>
      <p>(3) a hydrostatic pressure&nbsp;<img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/1a.jpg" width="222" height="73"> <br>

      <p>If&nbsp;<img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/1b.jpg" width="76" height="61"> is negative,
        an expansion of the dielectric will both increase the volume
        occupied by the dielectric and will also increase the value of K
        inside the dielectric. The hydrostatic pressure will be outward.

      <p>A general theorem for the development of hydrostatic pressure
        from electric fields requires the use of electrodes which
        provide a conical tube of force. The direction of the force is
        outward from the apex of the cone. </p>

      <p>It is not generally recognized that repulsion of like electric
        charges cannot take place unless these charges are within or
        near a different charge. For example: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/5a.jpg" width="716" height="290"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In case 1, the charges are both grounded and both are within a
        grounded container. The entire system, however, is at the
        potentiality of the Earth. In case 2, the charges are alike and
        within a container, all of which is elevated in potential above
        that of the Earth. Still there is no repulsion. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/5b.jpg" width="652" height="228"></p>
      </center>
      <p>For better configuration, it may be drawn as follows: </p>
      <p><i>Page 6</i> </p>

        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/6a.jpg" width="301" height="278"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Here two bodies are negatively charged within a container of
        like sign. A positive charge is within the container also. Lines
        of force connecting the positive charge to the two negatives are
        roughly parallel. Hence a repulsion exists between these lines.
        The points of anchorage A and B are forced apart, thus
        transmitting the repulsion to the two negatively charged bodies.
      </p>
      <p>It is the repulsion of the lines of force anchored to the
        bodies --- not the repulsion of the bodies themselves. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the action is as follows: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/6b.jpg" width="586" height="225"></p>
      </center>
      <p>There is also a force tending to elongate the positive charge.
      </p>
      <p><i>Page 7</i> </p>
      <p>Other representations of this action are as follows: </p>

      </center>
      <p>With the positive charge as a fixed anchor, the negative
        charges are forced as shown, with the longer arm "throwing" the
        charge at a proportionately greater velocity but less force. </p>
      <p>It is this principle which is suggested as supplying in the
        case of the "flying saucer" to be described. </p>

      <p>Hydrostatic pressure profiles have revealed the tri-arcuate

      <p>Ions generated and released at this point are repelled downward
        and outward by the electrons and negative ions released near the

      <p>In Fig 1, the radius of the center sphere is super-critical,
        that is, it is above the value required to produce an inward
        force on the outer sphere, i.e., a contraction. </p>
      <p>In Fig 2, the radius of the point charge is sub-critical, i.e.,
        it produces an outward force on the outer sphere or an
        expansion. </p>
      <p>If this is true, the force on the outer sphere inwardly is not
        strictly related to the inverse square of the radius.
        Conceivably there would be a critical value at which there would
        be no force present. This probably will be at some ratio of the
        two radii. </p>
      <p>If the outer radius is constant, the force of the outer sphere
        acting inwardly would diminish as the radius of the inner sphere
        is reduced and would reach zero at the critical ratio of radii
        or at a certain radius of the inner sphere or both. Further
        reduction of the radius of the inner sphere would cause a
        reversal of the force acting on the outer sphere thus producing
        expansion or outward force notwithstanding the existence of
        tension lines radially disposed. </p>

      <p>In plotting the lines of force in various electrode
        configurations, it becomes apparent that some rather surprising
        results could be produced which, at first glance, would seem to
        be in direct violation of the basic electrostatic laws. For
        example: </p>

      <p>Catalina Island, CA; March 26, 1973. </p>
      <p>If it is true that tribo-electric generation results from
        contact potential differences in dielectrics of differing
        dielectric constant and if it is true that the sliding motion or
        friction merely extends the effective surface of the dielectrics
        in contact and if it is true that the dielectric with greater K
        is always positive and the potential difference is related to
        the difference in dielectric constant, then it follows that a
        new type of generator is feasible. </p>
      <p>Using barium titanate (&gt; 10,000 K) rubbing a dielectric in
        the range less than 10, at high speed, would give the BaTiO<sub>3</sub>
        a positive charge relative to the other dielectric with which it
        is in sliding (frictional) contact. </p>
      <p>The possibility of using liquid or gaseous (negative)
        dielectric should be considered. Such as CCl<sub>4</sub>,
        benzene, toluene or transformer oil. A liquid with low elec.
        resistivity should be considered in order not to limit the
        current output of the generator. </p>
      <p>Both the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> and the liquid should have as high
        electrical conductivity as possible in order to conduct away the
        charges developed. </p>
      <p><i>Page 28.</i> </p>
      <p>Rotating discs or rods of barium titanate in electrically leaky
        oil might be a starting place. </p>
      <p>The setup would be as follows: </p>

      </center>
      <p>The action is simply oscillating the barium titanate rod at
        high speed under oil. The rod should become positively charged
        and the oil negative. </p>
      <p>If the electrical conductivity of the rod and the oil is high
        enough, useful current may be generated. </p>
      <p>This form of electric generator may be especially useful in
        directly generating high voltages. Where discs are employed in
        place of rods, the units may be stacked in series for high

      <p><b><i>90. Tribo-Excitation of Sands and Clays</i></b><a name="90"></a> </p>
      <p>In reviewing Record Book No. 1, I am impressed with the amount
        of thought I gave during the years 1955 and 1956 to the
        hypothesis of gravitationally anomalous materials and the
        methods by which these materials were (in nature) produced.
        Considerable thought was given to methods for artificially
        producing lighter-than-normal materials. </p>
      <p>In those days, such thoughts were rank heresy in respectable
        scientific circles and this is still the case today, although
        there are some researchers who tend to question some of the
        long-established postulates. One of these, of course, is the
        postulate of equivalence, accepted by Einstein and other leading
        theorists. Now there seems to be some question. The original
        Oetvos experiments equating gravitational mass to inertial mass
        have been repeated by Dicke to an accuracy of 1 x 10<sup>-11</sup>,
        seeming to confirm the equivalence. </p>
      <p>I firmly believe, however, that equivalence exists only when
        weak fields are present or utilized in the experiment. Strong
        fields would, I believe, show non-equivalence. Hence, the
        experiment described on page 40 of Record Book No. 1, entitled
        Centrifugal Differential Hydrometry might produce materials
        whose gravitational mass differed greatly from their inertial
        mass. </p>
      <p>This experiment certainly should be performed without further
        delay (it has already been 17 years! --- Inexcusable neglect) </p>
      <p><i>Page 31</i> </p>
      <p>But what is of immediate concern --- to get the ball rolling
        again --- is the creation of gravitationally light materials by
        friction (Coulomb friction). This may be termed Triboexcitation.
      </p>
      <p>On page 80 of Record Book No. 1, (Aug 26, 1956), the matter of
        triboexcitation s set forth. It merely calls for the use of a
        susceptible material such as aluminum silicate (clay) or some of
        the rare earth sands such as monazite. This material is placed
        in a glass (or quartz) container and shaken vigorously for a
        length of time. </p>
      <p>In short, the method merely calls for vibrating, in a paint
        shaker or the like, a glass bottle of certain clays or sands. </p>
      <p>This experiment, in crudest form, was performed today. A pint
        Mason jar partly filled with Sorrento (red) sand-clay from
        Sorrento, FL was weighed at the Avalon Post Office --- 1
        lb-14-1/2 oz. It was then vibrated for 20 minutes at Chet’s
        Hardware store on a paint shaker, then weighed (immediately)
        again. This time the scales did not balance in the same position
        but definitely balanced at 1 lb-14-1/4 oz; apparently a loss of
        1/4 oz. </p>
      <p>Of course, the scales could be in error or there was a human
        error in weighing. These possibilities I certainly recognize.
        But further tests will tell us. </p>
      <p><i>Page 32</i> </p>
      <p>If the 1/4 oz loss of weight was real, this experiment may be
        history-making. It may have represented a loss in weight of 1
        part in 122 or 0.819%. This would mean an excitation of 8.19
        millghos (see p. 79, Record Book No. 1) </p>
      <p>If excited to this amount, the <i>g</i> of this material
        (immediately after shaking) would be approx 972 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>
        rather than 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>! </p>
      <p>I intend to repeat this experiment, using the paint shaker, on
        the Sorrento sand and a more accurate balance than that at the
        Post Office. I have also ordered today, 1 lb samples of various
        monazite sands to be tested in a similar way, possibly also
        increasing the shaking time to 30 minutes or perhaps 1 hour. </p>
      <p>Later, if these effects persist, more refined, highly accurate
        quantitative tests are envisioned, possibly at USC or Stanford
        Research Institute. </p>

        weighing was accurately done at the Avalon Post Office (It is
        now confirmed by the Postmaster, Pete G. Salamunovich). </p>
      <p>The sample of red sand which was tested was contained (as in
        Sec. 90) in a glass Mason jar. In two day since the last
        excitation test on March 28, the weight had returned to normal;
        i.e., 1 lb-14-1/2 oz. It was then shaken for 30 minutes and then
        immediately (within 3 minutes) weighed. It then weighed less
        than 1 lb-4-1/4 oz, having lost at least 1/2 oz, possibly 0.3
        oz. </p>
      <p>This loss of weight (if 0.3 oz is considered) represents a
        greater degree of excitation than that recorded in Test 90. This
        may have been expected, as the duration of shaking was increased
        10 minutes. This represents a loss of weight of 1 part in 101.6
        or 0.984%. This represents an excitation of 9.84 millighos or a
        value of g approx 970.6 cm/sec<sup>2</sup> ! </p>

      </p>
      <p>Catalina Island, CA; March 31, 1973. </p>
      <p>On page 8 of Record Book No. 1, it is noted that C.F. Brush
        once performed some experiments producing what he termed
        super-light hydrogen. It was stated that this was done by some
        sort of preferential selection of ions in or during the
        electrolysis of water. No details are available at this writing.
      </p>
      <p>The question is asked --- what sort of preferential selection
        of ions. How can ions differ? </p>
      <p>Electrolysis of water to produce H<sub>2</sub> and O, normally
        is carried on within and under the body of water. The positive
        (H) ions and negative (O) ions migrate to the negative and
        positive electrodes respectively, and (following electrical
        neutralization) rise to the surface as atoms of gas. The ions
        are the ions of the respective elements H and O. </p>
      <p>Where can there be preferential selection of ions? </p>
      <p>Let us change to a situation where electrolysis takes place at
        the surface of the water, rather than underneath. Then by using
        positive rays impinging on the water surface, induce
        electrolysis. </p>
      <p><i>Page 36</i> </p>
      <p>The apparatus may be something like the following: </p>

      </center>
      <p>The thinking behind this experiment is that the high velocity
        positive rays (possibly H ions) generated in the vicinity of the
        positive electrode strike the surface of the water with
        considerable additional energy gained from the high voltage
        electrical field. Dissociation taking place at the surface,
        together with possible gravitic excitation may produce
        super-light hydrogen. </p>
      <p>It is not known whether Dr Brush used high-energy ion rays in
        his electrolysis, but it appears in any event, to have
        attractive possibilities. </p>
      <p>This method might be used to produce other
        gravitationally-anomalous gases as well. </p>

      <p>When a high voltage DC spark, traverses a space (let us say) of
        an inch or more the velocity of the component ions is
        considerable. Negative ions and electrons leave the cathode and
        accelerate toward the anode --- ionizing the gas molecules and
        atoms en route --- a conducting path is created by this "leader"
        permitting a high current positive ion cascade from the anode
        toward the cathode (usually the earth). The impact of these
        charges on the cathodic target could excite the material of the
        target gravitically. </p>
      <p>It is possible that lightning striking sand and/or clay could
        excite this material. This was proposed in Record Book No. 1,
        page 14. A development of this thought is recorded in pp. 92-96
        also. </p>
      <p>Material susceptible to gravitic excitation, when struck by
        high velocity positive ions (or particles) could become excited
        so as to lose weight. Hence, exitation may be accomplished by
        sparking. </p>

      <p>In the literature relating to the germination of seeds, it is
        recorded that germination of certain seeds has been speeded up
        by sparking. One wonders if then the seeds were gravitically
        excited and if gravitic excitation might affect life processes!
      </p>
      <p>Another natural phenomenon, which appears during lightning
        strokes, in the so-called "ball of fire". It is recorded that
        balls of fire, ranging in size from that of a golf ball to that
        of a basket ball, have been observed to come down chimneys,
        float around the room (like a toy balloon) and vanish. It has
        been considered by some scientists that the energy of the
        lightning stroke could have created (or released) antimatter,
        and that a timy nucleus of antimatter was being annihilated ---
        forming a reddish ball of luminescence. I am wondering, actually
        if the ball of fire could be gravitically excited nitrogen or
        oxygen caused by positive changes which were present in the
        lightning stroke. The visible (red) radiation from the ball of
        fire could be the energy being released by gravitic decay. </p>
      <p>In any event, the whole area of gravitic excitation by positive
        bombardment is intriguing. </p>

      <p><b><i>95. Antigravitational Materials in Nature.</i></b><a name="95"></a> </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; April 24, 1973. </p>
      <p>There are several synonyms for antigravitational materials,
        such as contra-terrene materials (CTM), antigravitic matter or
        antimatter. All are supposed to act oppositely in the (normal)
        gravity field. </p>
      <p>All such materials in the pure state are believed to loft in
        the Earth’s field, being repelled by the Earth and, if free,
        will accelerate (fall) into space and be lost. </p>
      <p>Hence, it would appear to be unlikely that antigravitic
        materials would ever be formed on Earth unless they were rigidly
        associated with and weighted down by terne materials. </p>
      <p>Such antigravitic matter in the presence of ordinary matter
        would likewise tend to decay. Even anti-matter, in the present
        accepted hypotheses, would react (violently) with matter,
        undergoing complete annihilation, accompanied by tremendous
        release of energy. It is presently believed that a
        matter-antimatter reaction would release far more energy than
        nuclear fusion.. </p>
      <p><i>Page 40.</i> </p>
      <p>It is conceivable, however, that matter and antimatter would
        "live together" if suitably insulated from one another. The
        "Liedenfrost" theory may provide such an answer. But even this
        requires the gradual radiation of energy. Hence, if antimatter
        were ever found trapped in ordinary matter, it would be revealed
        by its thermoactivity, being constantly warmer than the
        environment. </p>
      <p>The decay of excited terrestrial materials emitting heat, is
        similar (possibly related) to antimatter in the presence of
        matter. </p>
      <p>In searching for anti-gravitational material in nature, one
        would look for two things: </p>
      <p>(1) The spontaneous evolution of heat, and <br>
        (2) Retardation in gravitational acceleration (value of g). </p>
      <p>Charles Thomas Brush, in various articles in the Physical
        Review, found such materials in the complex silicates, lavas and
        clays. His experiments, performed at the Case Institute of
        Technology indicated retardation of g. Confirming tests
        performed at the National Bureau of Standards revealed a real
        and readily measurable evolution of heat. </p>
      <p>The scientific community has never recognized Dr Brush’s
        important discoveries in this field. No adequate theory to
        explain his results has ever been worked out. </p>
      <p><i>Page 41.</i> </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Dr Brush led the way, and someday his work will
        be recognized. </p>
      <p>There are several interesting materials which apparently are
        faintly antigravitic in nature. These are: </p>
      <p>(1) Sandusky clay (near Sandusky, Ohio) <br>
        (2) Loess <br>
        (3) Monazite (rare earth elements) <br>
        (4) Certain lavas, and volcanic glases. </p>
      <p>Either these materials an infinitesimal fraction of antimatter
        (insulated by Leidenfrost effect) or they are excited
        terrestrial material --- excited by cosmic radiation, sunlight
        or nuclear radiation or by a prehistoric event such as meteoric
        impact. </p>
      <p>One would look. For example, to the ejecta from meteorite
        craters, such as the Barringer Crater in Arizona, for residual
        or vestigial material, excited by the impact (white sand, south
        rim). </p>
      <p>Or, in lava flows, were material has emerged from deep within
        the possibly radioactive interior of the Earth. </p>
      <p>Or, in loess from deserts such as Sahara or Gobi, where
        susceptible excitation has lofted, decayed and returned to
        Earth. </p>
      <p><i>Page 42.</i> </p>
      <p>The rare earth elements --- most of the lanthanides are
        interesting possibilities. In the gravitational periodic table
        (prepared by the Townsend Brown Foundation) the rare earth
        elements have strangely low specific gravities, indicating
        gravitic excitation. These materials should be studied
        intensively for retardation of g and spontaneous evolution of
        heat. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to point out in this connection that the
        lanthanide series of elements is homologous with the actinide
        series of radioactive elements. </p>
      <p>Is it possible that the actinides are "radioactive" and
        (similarly) the lanthanides are "thermoactive", (?) both giving
        off energy! </p>
      <p>The element tantalum (atomic No. 73) is also anomalously light
        (sp gr 16.6) and may likewise be interesting to investigate. It
        is 15% lighter than (I believe) it should be. </p>
      <p>Aluminum is 30% lighter and silicon is 31% lighter. The
        compounds such as aluminum silicate (clay) and silicon dioxide
        (sand) are the materials Brush studied. </p>
      <p>Phosphorus is 21% lighter, Sulfur 14% lighter, and Chlorine
        13%. </p>
      <p>Ytterbium has the greatest anomaly of all, 59% lighter than
        normal, according to the table. </p>
      <p><i>Page 42.</i> </p>
      <p>If, in the course of biological evolution, the Creator has
        utilized anomalously light materials to advantage --- such as in
        the flight of birds or insects --- should we no look in this
        direction for clues? </p>
      <p>Suppose we consider the chemical composition of bird bones or
        that of the bodies of insects. Or certain air-borne pollens and
        spores. </p>
      <p>Calcium, however, is only 5% lighter than normal, according to
        the table. However, calcium may be combined with other elements
        (in the case of bird bones). Strontium, the homologue of calcium
        is 16% light. Maybe bird bones have more strontium? </p>
      <p>Monazite sand is interesting, consisting of small rounded
        grains, vari-colored, it has many of the rare earth elements.
        Centrifugal hydrometry could beneficiate this kind of material
        easily. (See p. 40, Record Bk 2). </p>
      <p>Tektites, believed to be of extraterrestrial origin (possibly
        from the moon) may be strewn on the Earth from lunar impact
        craters could be highly susceptible material (to gravitic
        excitation). Although extremely rare and expensive, tektites
        should be studied for information on gravitic excitation. </p>

      <p>It is proposed that rather simple experiments might be helpful
        in proving or disproving the idea that a loss of weight might
        accompany positive ray bombardment. </p>
      <p>A laboratory setup could take two forms, as follows: </p>

      <p>In Fig. 1, excitation may take place at atmospheric pressure.
        The positive corona around the fine wire in the interstices
        between sand grains may excite the grains immediately adjacent.
        That excitation may then spread by gravitic conduction from
        grain to grain, hence to the entire volume eventually. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 2, the susceptible material is placed in a partially
        evacuated glass tube and bombarded by positive ions. Loss of
        weight may follow. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; July 13, 1973. </p>
      <p>Except for very first experiments performed at Janesville, Ohio
        during the period from 1923 to 1930, all experiments wherein
        force is developed by massive high-K dielectrics the rotary form
        has been used. The sidereal radiation electrometer used in 1937
        and 1939, and all years since, was a rotor of differential high
        K<sub>m</sub> sectors. </p>
      <p>For some time, it has seemed possible to make a linear unit,
        one which may have surprising directional characteristics. </p>
      <p>The directional ability of the rotary electrometer (if any) is
        limited undoubtedly to the plane of the rotor. A linear
        electrometer should have a pronounced maximum in its
        longitudinal direction, and this would be a great assistance in
        determining the direction of origin of the (cosmic) radiation. </p>
      <p>In essence, the differential dielectrics and reactor elements
        would simply be straightened out into a line --- so that linear
        thrust would occur rather than torque. </p>
      <p>On the following page, such a linear electrometer is
        illustrated. In this particular form, the force causes the
        insulating fluid (transformer oil) to flow, and sensing depends
        upon the pressure differential of the oil at the two ends of the
        electrometer. </p>

      <p><b><i>98. Explanation for the Thrust of the Sidereal Radiation
            Electrometer</i></b><a name="98"></a> </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; Aug 19, 1973. </p>
      <p>Reasons for the thrust and for the variation in thrust are the
        two dominant questions. One cannot be fully answered without the
        other. </p>
      <p>In computing and analyzing the sidereal radiation records, it
        must be borne in mind that the instrument scale (with 50 as
        center) is inverted, so far as torque or thrust is concerned. </p>
      <p>For example, in the 1937 and 1939 records, a reading of 40
        represents twice the thrust (or torque) as 20. In future
        instruments the method of reading should be revised. This would
        mean, then, that the 16h ST peak would actually be a thrust
        minimum. In the case of lunar hour angle --- the passage of the
        meridian (transit) of the moon actually causes a lessening of
        thrust. </p>
      <p>In this connection, it is interesting to note that the Dayton
        C. Miller observations with the interferometer, both in
        Cleveland and on Mt Wilson, show minima at 16h ST. And this
        brings to my mind the statement made by Dr Miller in Cleveland,
        when he looked at our electrometer records, that they are
        "inverted". </p>
      <p><i>Page 51.</i> </p>
      <p>The physical connection between our "thrust" and the presence
        of the moon is certainly far from being readily explained. The
        first thought, naturally enough, was that it was tidal and
        related to the gravitational field or gravitational potential.
        This still may, or may not, be the case. </p>
      <p>The relation between our thrust and Miler’s residual "ether
        drift" is even more difficult to explain. I have no doubt that
        Miller’s very laborious electrometer readings are accurate and
        scientifically valid --- whether there is an ether or not.
        Miller’s work is monumental, certainly one of the classics of
        physics. His determination that the Earth (and the entire solar
        system) is moving away from the galactic center toward 5h RA 70
        S decl. at 227 km/sec is worthy of more consideration from
        scientists today than it is receiving. </p>
      <p>I have taken the time recently to study carefully Miler’s
        Report and have come to the conclusion that the interferometer
        arms change in length as the system is rotated with respect to
        the Earth’s movement thru space. Miler believed that the
        velocity (total time) of light was changing. He did acknowledge
        the possibility of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, and I
        believe Miller came to the conclusion that his observations
        showed only a fraction of the expected fringe-shift because of
        the almost complete cancellation resulting from the Lorentz
        contraction. The operation of this contraction was not (as
        stated) 100% but left a residual of 5% which appears to be what
        Miller observed. </p>
      <p><i>Page 52</i> </p>
      <p>Whether an ether does or does not exist is hardly the important
        point. What is important is that Miller observed something. The
        result was not entirely negative, as contemporary relativists
        would have us believe. </p>
      <p>My interest is --- what relation exists between Miller’s
        interferometer and our electrometer. One relates to the
        transmission of light and/or physical dimensions. The other
        relates to electric fields or electrical conductivity. </p>
      <p>It is possibly true that there are other related parameters
        such as gravitational potential, electrostatic potential of the
        Earth (as an "isolated" sphere in space), the dielectric
        constant and/or magnetic susceptibility of ambient space (k-mu
        density) and these possibilities may eventually come into this
        complex picture. Random or cyclic disturbances from
        gravitational waves could further add to the confusion. </p>
      <p>It appears certain that the Miller interferometer is related to
        the Brown electrometer. See chart (Fig 1): </p>

      <p>If there is truly a physical relation between the two
        phenomena, what is it? </p>
      <p>Hypothesis: </p>
      <p>(1) The interferometer arms could be changing length. The
        cohesive forces in matter (steel in this case) are largely
        electric. Electrostatic attraction (valence bonds and
        interatomic cohesiveness) could be affected by: </p>
      <p>(a) Dielectric permeability of medium <br>
        (b) Magnetic " " " <br>

        (b) Dielectric permeability (susceptibility <br>
        (c) Unknown factors </p>
      <p>(3) The relationship must be (it would seem) due to the
        electrical factors the two instrumentalities have in common. </p>
      <p>Let us look at the structure of the electrometer in detail.
        Realizing that the thrust requires electrical energy, current is
        the dominant factor. Variations in thrust must be accompanied by
        (or result from) changes in current. </p>
      <p><i>Page 55.</i> </p>
      <p>As a causative factor, electrical conductivity would be a
        likely candidate. It could be affected by: </p>
      <p>(a) ionization from penetrating radiation <br>
        (b) electron migration <br>
        (c) temperature <br>
        (d) physical contraction (velocity) <br>
        (e) " " (gravitational waves) <br>
        (f) gravitational potential <br>
        (g) electrostatic <br>
        (h) unknown factors </p>
      <p>Electrical resistance is not a simple thing. As a reciprocal of
        conductivity, resistance of ordinary substances, metal wire,
        etc., is not just a function of temperature but a host of other
        factors as outlined above. </p>
      <p>Let us look now at the structure of the electrometer with this
        much in view. </p>

      <p>It will be seen from Figs 1 and 2 that the voltage profiles of
        dielectric blocks of different resistivity act upon ambient
        regions of charged oil (ions) to move the body of oil with
        respect to the dielectric blocks. </p>
      <p>Hence, the thrust upon the dielectric blocks, and the oil in
        the opposite direction, arises from the electrostatic migration
        of positively-charged oil regions (we may even refer to them as
        ions). </p>
      <p>The magnitude of the thrust (torque of the rotor) depends upon
        the: </p>
      <p>(1) resistance difference between high and low conductivity

        (2) ion density (conductivity) of the leaky transformer oil. </p>
      <p><i>Summary:</i> </p>
      <p>In the foregoing, the torque of the electrometer is a direct
        function of the total current., There is no other energy source.
        High voltage is used to provide the electrostatic attraction for
        ion migration and ion-momentum transfer to the ambient body of
        transformer oil. The oil must be slightly conductive (leaky) to
        provide ions. </p>
      <p>The oil moves in one direction, the dielectric blocks in the
        opposite direction. </p>
      <p><i>Page 57.</i> </p>
      <p>The question which now comes to mind is why does the thrust
        change. Why does the differential resistance change with
        extra-terrestrial factors? </p>
      <p>There could be a resistance change in any one, two, or all
        three of the resistance bodies: </p>
      <p>(a) Low resistance block (marble) <br>
        (b) High " " (oiled pine wood) <br>
        (c) Transformer oil </p>
      <p>Only further critical testing will reveal the answer. </p>
      <p>All could be affected by penetrating radiation, nuclear or
        cosmic rays. Magnetic fields would not. I mean, of course, such
        magnetic fields as normally surround the instrument (terrestrial
        magnetism). </p>
      <p>A test performed in 1939 by Pomerantz (Bartol Res. Fdn.)
        indicated no observable change in torque resulting from placing
        a piece of radioactive copper (isotope) on the lid of the
        electrometer. This test was performed while the instrument was
        in its constant temperature vault in the basement of the Randal
        Morgan Lab of Physics, Univ. of Penn., Phila. No other test with
        radioactive material has been made. </p>
      <p>In any event, the sidereal and lunar characteristics of the
        torque are not correlated with penetrating radiation of any
        known type. </p>
      <p><i>Page 58.</i> </p>
      <p>Other non-ionizing radiation such as neutrino flux (from the
        sun) and gravitons from space can certainly penetrate the
        electrometer shielding but it is difficult to see how they could
        influence torque. </p>
      <p>One factor may be of immediate interest, and that is the
        electrostatic potential of the Earth (as an invisible, insulated
        sphere in space). All planets obviously receive charged
        particles from the sun. The solar wind consists of highly
        charged particles and presumably also electrons. The Earth
        intercepts and captures particles in constantly varying amounts.
        Hence, the net charge could be varying greatly, possibly to the
        extent of several million volts. </p>
      <p>The moon likewise may be charged, probably differently from the
        Earth. An electrostatic field could exist between the two. This
        could explain the effects of the moon upon the electrometer.
        Inductive effects of the Moon upon the Earth could readily alter
        the electrostatic charge on the Earth side facing the Moon. </p>
      <p>Instrument records indicate substantial changes with lunar
        phases and lesser changes with lunar right ascension,
        declination and lunar distance (apogee and perigee). </p>
      <p>Only two explanations come to my mind: (1) electrostatic
        potential and (2) gravitational potential. </p>
      <p><i>Page 59.</i> </p>
      <p>To my knowledge, there is no accepted method for measuring the
        electrostatic potential of the Earth. There is no reference
        potential. It would be like a mono-polar voltmeter. </p>
      <p>In the literature, the work of Prof. Fernando Sanford (Prof.
        Emeritus of Physics, Stanford Univ.) comes to mind. Shortly
        after 1900, Prof Sanford published "Terrestrial Electricity" (<i>Univ.













          Series Math. And Astron</i>., Vol. II, No. 1, L.C. QC 806.S3
        AS 36L56, Vol. 2, No. 1). </p>
      <p>In this volume, as I remember, Prof Sanford conducted
        investigations with a quadrant electrometer and obtained some
        striking evidence of lunar electrostatic effects. I am trying to
        locate this reference at the present time. Sanford reports that
        it is out of print. L.A. Public Library has misplaced its copy.
      </p>
      <p>My program for the immediate future is to concentrate on the
        possibility that the electrometer is indicating resistance
        changes. I will be looking for other research and other evidence
        that include resistance changes which are not accounted for. </p>
      <p>This is especially important if these changes accompany any of
        the lunar cycles or are correlated with sidereal time. </p>

      <p>Since the instrument scale is inverted, and since an increase
        in torque requires an increase in total current, it necessarily
        follows that an increase in instrument reading (instrument
        units) means an increase in resistance. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; Aug 19, 1973. </p>
      <p>In 1892, Prof Sanford prepared a report of experiments
        performed at Leland Stanford Univ. on the resistance of a
        section of copper wire 1 mm diameter, 120 cm long. The report
        subtitled "Some Observations upon the Conductivity of a Copper
        Wire", published by the University. LA Public Library R 537.22.4
      </p>
      <p>His copper wire, reported at 1 mm, therefore was 0.039"
        diameter or No. 18. According to resistance tables of pure
        copper (99.5%), the resistance of No. 18 is approx. 0.00635
        ohms/ft. Sanford reports approx. 0.03400 ohms at 22° C for the
        length of 120 cm. <br>
        Sanford: 0.0280 ohms/cm; Tables: 0.02508 ohms/cm. </p>
      <p>In the Sanford experiments, the resistance changed with
        temperature according to the equation: </p>
      <p>R<sub>temp</sub> = 11 T + 3159 </p>
      <p>Sanford attempted to observe any (theoretically possible)
        increase in resistance due to the immersion of the conductor in
        liquids and/or gases of high specific inductive capacity (K). </p>
      <p>His results, while indicating to him at least, a systematic
        positive result was s irregular and confusing, that he concluded
        hoping "to pursue these investigations much farther during the
        coming year (1893), and to accumulate data from which it may be
        legitimate to make comparisons". </p>

      <p>Catalina Island; August 19, 1973 </p>
      <p>In the preceding section, reference was made to the work of
        Fernando Sanford. A copper wire 1 mm diameter, 120 cm long was
        tested repeatedly and an anomalous change in resistance was
        noted. </p>
      <p>Statistics from the Sanford data indicate that Sanford was
        confused by the irregularity. On page 10 of his report, he
        states, "The cause of this irregularity is unknown to me". </p>
      <p>In working over his statistics, correcting his results for
        temperature variations, I have come to the conclusion that the
        resistance changed radically from day to day and even from hour
        to hour. Such a change in secular or cyclic fashion, Sanford
        apparently did not recognize. There is no report in the
        literature to my knowledge at this time that Sanford continued
        these observations in subsequent years (as he wrote he intended
        to do). </p>
      <p>Resistance anomalies, computed from Sanford data (corrected for
        temperature variations) show both secular and cyclic changes.
        These are 3 peaks which are evident between Feb 22 and May 19,
        1892, on March 7, April 6 and May 5 which appear to be related
        to the position of the moon. </p>

        These peaks seem to coincide with instrument minima. In this
        case, then, the instrument increases torque as resistance (of
        copper) increases. This is exactly opposite to what might be
        expected if torque is a function of current. </p>

      <p>A critical examination of the variations in resistance observed
        in the Sanford data brings one squarely face to face with the
        possibility that electrical resistance of copper, and possibly
        all substances, does vary in a secular and possibly cyclic
        manner. </p>
      <p>To my knowledge this phenomenon has never been observed before.
        If it has, it may have been attributed to experimental error or
        below the limits of reliable observation. If found to be
        verified by repeated experiment it could represent one of the
        most significant discoveries in physics. </p>
      <p>Any possible correlation with extra-terrestrial causative
        factors could be equally significant. </p>
      <p>In view of Weber’s experiments, supposedly involving the effect
        of gravitational waves upon large metal cylinders and the like,
        one naturally wants to consider the possibility that such
        cylinders undergo electrical resistance changes longitudinally
        and transversely. What effect, if any, could resistance changes
        have upon the physical dimensions or shape of such cylinders? </p>
      <p>Going back to the change in resistance of the Sanford 120 cm
        copper wire, could the resistance change cause a corresponding
        change in length? Or, did a change in length cause the
        resistance change? Could Weber have observed changes in the
        lengthwise/crosswise shape of his detectors by simple resistance
        measurement of the metal itself? </p>
      <p><i>Page 67</i> </p>
      <p>Two possibilities become apparent: </p>
      <p>(1) If extraterrestrial factors cause a change in resistance
        directly, then does a change in dimension follow? If so, the
        physical movement follows the resistivity "signal". There would
        be a lag or so-called inertial distortion. Further, resistance
        changes would not be limited by or reflect the mechanical
        "follow-up". If the metal "detector" is resonant (as any metal
        object is), the driving signal may be independent and
        non-resonant. Hence, by observing resistance changes in
        gravitational wave receivers one may avoid the serious
        limitation of resonance or "ringing" of the metal mass. </p>
      <p>(2) If the extraterrestrial factors cause a change in dimension
        (as gravitational waves are alleged to do) then the change in
        resistance follows the change in dimension. If, in Weber’s
        detectors, the resistance "rings" also, then it is pretty clear
        proof that the resistivity of the metal follows the change in
        dimension. </p>
      <p>The following experimental set-up is suggested as a means by
        which this mater may be resolved. It is essentially a sensitive
        resistance bridge with long East-West/North-South arms. It will
        be referred to as a Resistance Cross. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; August 20, 1973. </p>
      <p>It is proposed that a "resistive cross" be defined as a
        resistance bridge with extended linear arms. The cross may be
        fixed in the N-S/E-W direction or it may be made to rotate like
        a turnstile. </p>
      <p>Coiled resistors are not used, only linear lengths of wire. </p>
      <p>In terms of the Sanford experiment, one arm may be similar to
        the single length of wire coaxial within a copper tube. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/68.jpg" width="833" height="158"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This is the experimental setup Sanford used. Resistance varied
        over a range of 6<sup>-4</sup> ohms 1.76% (temp. compensated)
        during the period from Feb 17-May 19, 1892. </p>
      <p>A basic resistance cross would consist of four such arms in a
        bridge circuit with null voltage output when balanced. Any
        imbalance would cause a voltage. </p>
      <p>Several sizes of resistance cross may be foreseen; the smaller
        ones may be rotatable, whereas the larger ones may be fixed ---
        say in the N-S/E-W direction. </p>
      <p><i>Page 69</i> </p>
      <p>The rotatable cross: </p>
      <p>The rotatable cross may b as large, let us say, as the
        interferometer used by Miller on Mt Wilson in 1926. Its use may
        be similar in many respects and so may the results. After all,
        if Miller’s interferometer arms were contracting (in the
        alignment of the earths motion through space), then too, the
        resistance arms of the cross would contract for the same reason.
        The resistance would change in concert with the change in
        length. </p>
      <p>One would expect to obtain in the resistance data possible the
        same results as Miller obtained in his fringe shifts. It is
        intriguing to believe the observations of electrical resistance
        might provide information as to the velocity and direction of
        the earth’s movement thru space. </p>
      <p>The field cross: </p>
      <p>The largest fixed cross may have arms several thousand feet in
        length. Preferably, these arms would be in shielded conduit at
        least 2 ft under the surface of earth for reasons of temperature
        stability. The same bridge circuit would be used. </p>
      <p>Such a cross would rotate because of the Earth’s rotation and
        this arrangement might be comparable to Weber’s large cylinder.
        Again, the resistance data may indicate a sidereal effect just
        as Weber’s is doing --- toward the center of the galaxy! </p>
      <p>In this connection, Weber’s results may be related to Miller’s
        results may be related to Miller’s results, both see maxima at
        16h ST. So, too, the electrometer records of 1937 and 1939 show
        maxima at 16h ST. I am sure there must be a common denominator
        somewhere that would tie all these phenomena together. </p>
      <p>Going further into the construction of a large fixed resistance
        cross, the following suggestions may be made: </p>
      <p>(1) Multiple linear conductors in each arm. <br>
        (2) Use of wire with low temperature coefficient of resistance,
        such as Stableohm 1040 (+/- 5 ppm). <br>
        (3) Use wires in pairs only, both Stableohm going and coming. <br>
        (4) AC excitation to avoid earth current effects. <br>
        (5) Use a rapid response recording galvanometer arranged for AC
        input. <br>
        (6) Constant voltage AC supply. </p>

      </center>
      <p><i>Page 72.</i> </p>
      <p>It is proposed that the fixed cross be constructed in several
        sizes, starting with the smallest, as a pair: </p>
      <p>Step 1 --- Arms 10 ft long. No. 26 Stableohm 1040. 10 pairs (20
        lengths) per arm. 200’ per arm. R = [ ] per arm. </p>
      <p>Step 2 --- Arms 2 ft long. No. 26 Stableohm 1040. 50 pairs (100
        lengths) per arm. 200’ per arm. R = [ ] per arm. </p>
      <p>Using a 2-point recorder, compare the simultaneous readings of
        the above. </p>
      <p>Purpose: To determine the effect of increasing the arm length.
        Resistance remaining constant. </p>
      <p>If results are positive and funds become available arms lengths
        up to several thousand feet may be considered. In such cases an
        installation in the desert in long trenches 2 ft deep may be
        worthwhile. Conduits with adequate internal insulation would be
        required. In long arms, leakage may be a problem and these
        details would have to be carefully worked out. </p>
      <p><i>Page 73.</i> </p>
      <p>In this connection, the thought has occurred to me that
        lead-covered multi-pair telephone cable might be used. This
        would offer adequate insulation and protection against moisture
        and could be buried in a trench. But the conductors are of
        copper and the temperature coefficient is 3900 ppm, whereas
        Stableohm 1040 is +/- 5 ppm. </p>
      <p>Whether the temperature stability of the lead-covered cable in
        a trench 2 ft deep (or more if possible) would make the
        difference remains to be worked out. </p>
      <p>The best possible combination, of course, would be to use
        Stableohm conductors in a lead-covered cable, also buried to a
        depth where the temperature is relatively constant. </p>
      <p>Vertical arms: Another variation which should be considered is
        the use of a vertical arm in relation to a horizontal arm. </p>
      <p>Then, of course, many different installations are foreseen, in
        many locations on the Earth’s surface. Such installations should
        be telemetrically interconnected so that coincidences may be
        noted. </p>

      <p>Catalina Island Island; Aug 27, 1973. </p>
      <p>The most satisfactory explanation of the torque of the
        electrometer, at least to me at this writing, is related to the
        difference in the resistivity of the marble and wood sectors of
        the rotor. The electrostatic field adjacent to the sectors
        (facing the reactor plate) is asymmetrical in its effect upon
        (+) charged oil domains (all these positively charged oil ions
        if you will), so that the ions are pulled (predominantly) in one
        direction by the sectors, and this causes a net torque on the
        rotor. </p>
      <p>In other words, the oil moves around in one direction and the
        rotor turns in the opposite direction. Difference in torque with
        time of day, etc., is merely a reflection of the resistivity
        difference at that moment. </p>
      <p>Although this arrangement, in the form of a torsion
        electrometer, is convenient and reliable in many respects, it is
        fundamentally indirect. A more direct approach would be to
        measure (and record) the resistance differential electrically
        and hence, not be subject to inertial lag such as that
        introduced by a rotor mechanically. </p>
      <p>Several forms of differential resistor bridges are possible but
        all of them operate by reason of the same principle: i.e., that
        electrical conductivity of all materials is no a constant --- as
        has been supposed --- with time of day (lunar, solar and
        sidereal time) and perhaps even the motion of the Earth in
        space". </p>
      <p>Fernando Sanford (p. 62) observed these variations during the
        period of his experiments in 1892 but obviously was confused by
        his own measurements and did not attribute the variations to
        cosmic factors. </p>
      <p>The sidereal radiation electrometer as described on p. 50, has
        made possible at least 5 years of observations which show most
        convincingly these cosmic factors. It is quite logical then that
        these same factors could (and probably do) influence the
        electrical conductivity of (at least) marble and pine wood.
        Sanford’s work shows that copper too is affected. </p>
      <p>It follows that other materials, conductors and
        semi-conductors, must also be subject to the same phenomenon. It
        is the purpose of this investigation to examine this anomalous
        change in resistivity as it occurs in (1) metal wires, (2)
        semi-conductors, (3) insulating materials. </p>
      <p><i>Page 76.</i> </p>
      <p>As stated on p. 68, one of the first experiments proposed is
        that of utilizing the resistance bridge with (1) arms of wire of
        different metals, or (2) arms of the same wire in different
        orientation, such as a cross. </p>
      <p>A resistance cross utilizing Stableohm 1040 was diagrammed on

        provide some evidence of the direction in space from which this
        anomalous cosmic effect comes. </p>
      <p>Another form of resistance bridge uses aluminum wire versus
        platinum wire. Platinum as a higher specific resistivity (10.6)
        than aluminum (2.65). But platinum has a density of 21.4 while
        aluminum is 2.7, approx. 8 times heavier. If mass is a factor
        this difference should be significant, gravitationally speaking.
        If dielectric constant is a factor, assuming a relation to
        atomic number and/or mass, again a significant difference should
        be evident. </p>
      <p>On the matter of dielectric constant, metals theoretically
        should possess extremely high dielectric constants (specific
        inductive capacity or electric permitivity), but the great
        electrical conductivity prevents its determination in the usual
        way. </p>
      <p><i>Page 77.</i> </p>
      <p>In any event, a bridge made of aluminum versus platinum wire is
        suggested. Such an experimental setup is as follows: </p>

        preferably Brush galvanometer with amplifier for recording rapid
        fluctuations &lt;100 cps. </p>
      <p>For simplicity, the wire may be strung lengthwise between two
        supports 1 ft apart, then cabled within shrink tubing. There
        would be 8 terminals as follows: </p>

      <p><i>Page 78.</i> </p>
      <p>The foregoing structure would be about 1/2 inch diameter, 1 ft
        long. A wood rod may form the center support for rigidity. Leads
        would be cabled and in identifying colors. Power may be supplied
        by a 6V storage battery or even a 2V dry cell. </p>
      <p>Protection against temperature changes would have to be
        provided. First observations will reveal how serious this
        problem is. </p>
      <p>It is entirely possible that this linear wire structure may be
        vector-sensing. If it is founded to be directional, alignment
        with the source of fluctuation may be possible. This is an
        intriguing thought. </p>
      <p>Certainly, this structure is readily portable. The recording
        instruments may also be portable and battery-operated, so that
        installations in various geographic spots are possible. </p>
      <p>Several units of this type must be ready and operating for the
        advent of the passage of the Earth through the tail residue of
        the Kohoutek comet. Mt Wilson should be one of these locations.

      <p>In reviewing the foregoing entry (p. 74), the thought occurs
        that the same results may be obtained by using readily available
        resistor components rather than to go to the trouble and expense
        of winding special forms. </p>
      <p>The disadvantage would be that mass or density differential
        would not be as great. No commercial resistors, for example, are
        made with aluminum and tungsten (or platinum) wires. However, a
        considerable mass differential may be obtained by using carbon
        and wire-wound resistors which are cheap and readily obtainable.
      </p>
      <p>Non-inductive wire-wound resistors are suggested. Standard
        carbon resistors are probably adequate, at least to start with.
        Variable wire-wound resistors in the 10 kiloohm range may permit
        adjustment to zero null. </p>

            Cause of Thrust (Torque) of the Sidereal Radiation
            Electrometer.</i></b><a name="105"></a> </p>
      <p>Aug. 31, 1973. </p>
      <center>

      </center>
      <p>Referring to p. 55 of this notebook, it is noted that the most
        immediate probable explanation for the torque of the
        electrometer lies in the movement of the charged domains (ions)
        in the oil bath. </p>
      <p>It has long been observed that torque occurs only when the
        transformer oil is leaky, that is, slightly conductive as a
        result of a small moisture content. Perfectly dry transformer
        oil produces no torque. </p>
      <p><i>Page 81.</i> </p>
      <p>Proof of this conductivity appears in the readings of the panel
        meters --- representing current to ground (+). This current
        depends upon the distance (inversely) between the rotor and the
        reactor plates. Normally it is 2 ua for the upper reactor and 7
        ua for the lower reactor. The lower reactor was nearer the rotor
        and this would account for the higher current. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/81a.jpg" width="483" height="352"></p>

      </center>
      <p>Recognizing that this current represented ion flow, it is
        obvious that the ions would flow in the direction of the field
        gradient. The velocity or kinetic energy would depend also upon
        the intensity of the electric field at that point. </p>
      <p>In general then, the net ion flow would depend upon the shape
        and intensity of the electric field at the sides of the
        dielectric sectors facing the reactor plates. </p>
      <p>Three situations are illustrated in Figs. 1, 2, 3. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 1, the adjacent sectors of the dielectric rotor have
        equal (high) conductivity so that the electric gradient between
        the electrodes is virtually linear. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 1, the 2 adjacent sectors of the dielectric rotor have
        equal (high) conductivity so that the electric gradient between
        the electrodes is virtually linear. </p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: It must be remembered that where there is
        transverse leakage the electric gradient thru the dielectric can
        never be strictly linear. In Fig 1, for sake of explanation,
        this is overlooked. </p>
      <p>Again, in Fig. 1, positive ions migrating from the region of
        the positive reactor move in the direction and extent indicated
        by the vectors. In this instance, the vectors balance and there
        is no net flow. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 2, dielectric B has lower has lower conductivity
        (higher resistance) and the gradient is shifted downward because
        of the transverse current drain. The field is distorted as
        indicated by the vectors so that imbalance exists. This
        imbalance causes a net flow of oil (ion momentum transfer) in
        the direction indicated. Reaction to this force causes the
        dielectric pair to move in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 3, dielectric B has still higher resistance (with
        respect to A) and the thrust is increased. </p>
      <p><i>Page 83.</i> </p>
      <p>The foregoing is probably an oversimplification of an
        exceedingly complex situation. Here we actually have to consider
        the resistivity of A and B but also that of the oil and the
        relative interaction of all three. </p>
      <p>If varying resistance is the cause, the reasons for such
        varying resistance are still obscure. Ionizing radiation could
        affect the ion population in the oil. It could also conceivably
        affect the resistance of the dielectric sectors. But it seems
        inconceivable that the relatively small changes in, let us say,
        cosmic radiation could produce such relatively great changes in
        torque as have been observed since 1937. </p>
      <p>And again, of course, the correlation with sidereal time and
        certain lunar factors seems to rule out ionization changes as a
        cause for the variations in torque. Some other as yet
        unidentified cosmic factor must be affecting "simple electrical
        resistance". </p>
      <p>In terms of the "dogma" of electrical engineering, this thought
        is rank heresy. The resistance of conductors, of all materials
        actually, is not known to vary except with temperature. I am not
        forgetting the photoconductivity, ionizing radiation, ad other
        related phenomena, but these do not appear to be factors here. </p>
      <p><i>Page 84.</i> </p>
      <p>In brief, what we seem to be observing is a basic change in
        resistivity of metals, and probably all other materials as well,
        which is related to extraterrestrial factors. It appears,
        further, that the change in resistivity is not the same for all
        metals (or all substances) but varies with some other factor
        such as mass (density) or dielectric constant. </p>
      <p>To observe this phenomenon, we must use (preferably) a
        resistance bridge with arms of dissimilar metal. This means
        resistors of aluminum wire versus tungsten (which is less
        expensive) or even commercially available resistors such as
        carbon b\versus wire wound. This is based upon the assumption
        (for the time being at least) that a mass differential is the
        important factor. </p>
      <p>The resistive bridge concept is a significant improvement over
        the complicated sidereal radiation electrometer, (1) because it
        is simple electrically, (2) because it is simple electrically,
        (3) no inertial lag, (4) more accurate and (5) far better
        frequency sensitivity especially in the higher range. </p>
      <p>An in-line resistance bridge, also the resistance cross (p. 71)
        may also have the advantage of being directionally sensitive, so
        that it may actually "point" to the source in space. </p>

      <p>Catalina Island, Sept 2, 1973. </p>
      <p>When the sidereal radiation electrometer was designed in 1931
        at the Naval Research Lab, the prevailing thought which I
        expressed at that time to Drs Hulbert, Maris, Gunn and Dawson
        was that I was looking for a mass and dielectric constant
        effect. I referred to the adjacent sectors of the electrometer
        rotor as high K<sub>m</sub> and low K<sub>m</sub>, the former
        being marble and the latter pine wood. </p>
      <p>In the analysis on p. 80 and 81, Dielectric A relates to marble
        and Dielectric B relates to pine wood. See also p. 55, also p.
        46. </p>
      <p>In the previous sections of this notebook, the emphasis has
        shifted from the original idea to a consideration of electrical
        resistance. To completely abandon the idea of dielectric
        constant (electrical susceptance) at this point may be a
        mistake. Mass differential has not been abandoned It appears in
        the considerations of the "mass" of the resistance wires in the
        vaporizing arms of the resistance bridge. (p. 79). </p>
      <p><i>Page 86.</i> </p>
      <p>Now, it may be helpful to include high- and low-K capacitors
        with the high- and low-mass wires of the resistance bridge, as:

      <p>In the above figure, a wire-wound resistor with a high-K
        capacitor in parallel is balanced against a carbon resistor with
        a low-K capacitor in parallel. </p>
      <p>Therefore, if the cosmic effect "gets in" through any one or
        two or all three, i.e., dielectric constant, (electric
        permitivity), electrical resistance or mass (density), it will
        show up in the balance. </p>
      <p>In pursuit of this thought, Hi-Cap, ceramic capacitors (with
        value of K upward from 3000) are indicated. They may be balanced
        against low-K paper paper dielectric capacitors. </p>

            (of the Earth as a whole).</i></b><a name="107"></a> </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; Sept 4, 1973. </p>
      <p>The question arises, "why does (if it does) basic resistance of
        metal wires and other materials change with cosmic variables?" </p>
      <p>One thought I have retained for a long time is that the
        electrical potential of the Earth (as an isolated sphere in
        space) may change to a surprisingly great extent, possibly
        millions of volts. Fernando Sanford believed this too and based
        many of the ideas presented in his book "Terrestrial
        Electricity" upon such a possibility. He believed that the Earth
        was negatively charged by electron emission from the Sun. He
        conceived of a solar wind but believed that the "wind" was
        composed largely of electron emitted by the "hot" sun. His
        thought was that the Earth could acquire a charge of "several
        million volts". So could the moon. And inductive effects could
        arise between the Moon and earth when the relative potentials
        varied. (See p. 58). </p>
      <p>Sanford postulated that if the Moon, because of its rotation
        around the Earth, possessed a different and variable charge with
        respect to the earth, then the Moon-side of the earth would be
        inductively affected. </p>
      <p><i>Page 88.</i> </p>
      <p>Certainly, the lunar effects such as hour angle, phase, etc.,
        as indicated by the sidereal radiation electrometer could be
        caused by the electrostatic potential of the Earth in just this
        way. </p>
      <p>In this respect, the electrometer could be operating as a
        monopolar voltmeter, a concept not easily today. It must be
        recalled, however, that Sanford’s "Quadrant Electrometer" which
        he described in his "Terrestrial Electricity" did appear to be
        doing just that. </p>
      <p>If electrical resistance does change with absolute
        electrostatic potential --- why does it? Is it a matter of
        electron density --- call it, carrier abundance? Does increased
        negativity cause increased conductivity? Or looking at it in
        terms of resistivity, is resistance a direct function of
        positivity? </p>
      <p>The 1937 and 1939 readings of the electrometer reveal strong
        lunar and solar effects which could be attributed, in terms of
        the above, to resistance changes caused by earth potential
        changes. </p>
      <p>A problem arises when one tries to explain the sidereal (16h)
        peak in this way. Is there an inductive effect toward the
        galactic center? </p>
      <p><i>Page 89.</i> </p>
      <p>Or, is there hitherto unknown particulate radiation from the
        galactic center? </p>
      <p>And also what was causing the (residual) fringe shifts in the
        Miller interferometer? Was this due to a change in the velocity
        of light or the length of the interferometer arms? I suspect it
        is the latter. </p>
      <p>I suspect that electrostatic potential can change physical
        dimensions too, but I am puzzled as to why this effect is
        directional. If electrostatic potential is scalar, why did
        Miller’s interferometer arms contract differentially? And how
        was it that he was able to deduce a net movement of the Earth
        thru space? Actually, his computations indicated movement
        opposite to that expected by astronomers, i.e., toward 5h RA at
        208 k/sec rather than toward 16-17h RA at 19 m/sec. </p>
      <p>Is there a relation between net charge and velocity? Is there a
        relation between net charge and the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
        contraction? Or, putting it another way, how does this
        relativistic contraction affect conductivity and/or electron
        density. Does "absolute motion" create a conductivity (or
        resistivity) vector? If electron density is altered in the
        direction of absolute motion and conductivity is affected, then
        I can see where the velocity vector enters the resistance
        picture. </p>
      <p><i>Page 90.</i> </p>
      <p>This, then, in summarizing, may mean that resistance decreases
        in the alignment of absolute motion, and to an amount dependent
        upon the rate of motion. </p>
      <p>This hypothesis provides a reason for the operativeness of the
        resistance cross&nbsp; (p. 71). The arms of the cross in the
        alignment of absolute motion would decrease in electrical
        resistance. The arms normal to that motion would not change in
        resistance. </p>
      <p>One wonders now if Weber’s results could be explained not on
        the basis of gravitational waves but upon the basis of
        resistivity changes. If the large aluminum cylinder suffers
        resistance changes, longitudinally versus transversely, and
        these changes affect its shape, strain gauges might pick it up.
        Velocity vectors would give it preference for alignment with the
        center of the galaxy and correlate with Miller’s observations
        that the velocity is actually in the direction away from the
        galactic center (5h ST). </p>
      <p>Weber concluded that gravitational waves are coming
        predominately from the galactic center. Resistance measurements
        may indicate instead merely absolute motion toward 4h RA (See <i>Science













          News</i>, Aug. 18 and 25, 1973, Vol. 104, No. 7 and 8,
        97-128), p. 108. </p>
      <p><i>Page 91.</i> </p>
      <p>In the above reference, it is also noted that the recessional
        velocity of galaxies, calculated from their red-shifts, is not
        isotropic. It is clumped and the clumping may indicate a
        velocity of the solar system in the direction of 5h RA. Again,
        this may confirm Miller’s findings. See p. 114 of the foregoing
        <i>Science News</i> reference. </p>
      <p>Now then, if these resistance changes do occur, there must be a
        reason for sudden changes such as might shock-excite Weber’s
        cylinders. Gradual changes, such as the lunar effects, could not
        be picked up by Weber. </p>
      <p>The electrometer reveals not only slow long-term cycles,
        sidereal and secular variations but also rapid changes which tax
        (and may largely escape) detection by the massive rotor’s
        movement. </p>
      <p>A resistance cross and bridge could easily pick up such rapid
        changes. For this reason it is recommended that a Brush
        recording galvanometer be used in connection. This will indicate
        changes up to 100 Hz. For higher frequencies it is recommended
        that the sensing system include sonic amplifiers and loud
        speakers. </p>
      <p>I can well imagine that sounds will be heard and this is
        intriguing. Perhaps frequencies of 1580 Hz and 1661 Hz (Weber’s
        resonant frequencies) will appear from time to time, such as may
        possibly be exciting his cylinders. </p>
      <p><i>Page 92.</i> </p>
      <p>If electrostatic potential (of the Earth) causes these
        resistance changes exclusively, the capacitance of the Earth as
        a whole will probably limit the frequency --- let us say, the
        upper frequency. The capacitance of the Earth (as a conducting
        sphere in space) is said to approximately one Farad. This is an
        enormous capacitance and, unless the driving potential is of
        equal magnitude, could well smooth out most of the higher
        frequencies. </p>
      <p>Another source of "apparent" resistance variations might be the
        voltage contributions from changing K of space --- so-called "K
        waves". Space may be defined as K-mu. The velocity of light is
        dependent upon both the electrical permitivity and magnetic
        permeability of the medium thru which it passes. </p>
      <p>C = 1 / sq. root k mu </p>
      <p>If k waves exist, they probably are not limited to the velocity
        of light (C) since K is more basic. K waves may be instantaneous
        (infinite velocity) and be truly "action at a distance" as
        envisioned by Newton. </p>
      <p>Actually, magnetic permeability is the counterpart. Both K and
        mu, so far as space is concerned, go together. But for the
        present, let us consider only the effects that a variation in K
        can produce on the apparent resistance of a conductor. </p>
      <p><i>Page 93.</i> </p>
      <p>For the sake of explanation, let us consider a simple charged
        condenser&nbsp; (capacitor). If the dielectric constant (wrongly
        named because it may not be constant) changes, the voltage
        changes inversely. In other words, the terminal voltage of any
        capacitor (for a given charge) is inversely proportional to its
        K (the dielectric constant of its dielectric). </p>
      <p>Hence, a section of wire is also a capacitor. The dielectric
        constant of a metal is theoretically considered to be very high.
        Any change in its K will affect the terminal voltage of the
        section. But a current must be flowing for the capacitance
        effect to be present. </p>
      <p>Resistance and capacitance are therefore related. A variation
        of K in a conductor can create an EMF which may add or subtract
        from the IR loss of the conductor, giving the appearance of a
        change in resistance. </p>
      <p>K waves from space (if they exist) may cause apparent
        variations of resistance of a conductor, just as they would
        cause variations in the terminal voltage of any capacitor. </p>
      <p><i>Page 94.</i> </p>
      <p>It follows then, that resistance of electrical conductors may
        be affected by: </p>
      <p>(1) absolute electrostatic potential changes resulting from
        electron density and motion thru space; </p>
      <p>(2) K waves. </p>
      <p>Long range, comparatively slow variations may originate in (1)
        while rapid variations could only originate in (2). </p>
      <p>Note: It must be borne in mind, in making the distinction
        above, that the capacitance of the Earth (p. 92) may also be
        subject to K waves, so as to change the absolute potential. Such
        an effect may actually be present for the slow variations (long
        waves) but may average out the faster variations. </p>
      <p>On p. 85, the effect of mass was discussed briefly as the
        combination Km. Mass (density) and K were grouped together. The
        function of mass in these considerations is not quite clear and
        will be taken up in later pages. In general, mass is so
        interlocked with dielectric constant in metals that these two
        factors are virtually inseparable. Wire with high mass, such as
        platinum or tungsten, is considered also to have high K, and it
        is chosen in the resistance bridges (herein discussed) for this
        reason. </p>
      <p><i>Page 95.</i> </p>
      <p>Wires with low mass, such as aluminum, and also carbon
        resistors, are thought to have low K. </p>
      <p>The differential resistance bridges set forth in the previous
        pages make use of high K<sub>m</sub> and low K<sub>m</sub> arms.
        In general, the high Km arms conduct more current/unit length
        and therefore must be longer to have equivalent resistance,
        although with certain metals this is not the case. </p>
      <p>One wonders, quite naturally, why this resistance variation has
        not been observed --- considering to what great sophistication
        the electronic technology has reached in recent years. The
        thought is discouraging to say the least. I have no idea. Maybe
        it is simply that when variations were noticed, they were blamed
        on experimental error, temp. errors or random fluctuations in
        experimental equipment. </p>
      <p>Maybe, the idea of combining heavy and light conductors as arms
        of a resistance bridge was never considered. Possibly there was
        no theory to predict any effect or to justify the experiment.
        Only time will tell. We shall see. </p>

      <p>Catalina Island; Sept 6, 1973. </p>
      <p>A bridge operating strictly on the basis of a capacitance
        change with DC feed will produce observable variations, if
        theory is correct, only during a change in the incoming factor
        (whatever that factor may be). In other words, it is strictly a
        "rate-of-change" function. </p>
      <p>If an incoming K wave strikes a charged capacitor, the terminal
        voltage will change only while the K (potential) is changing.
        Steady K potential creates no voltage. </p>
      <p>The same may be said of an inductance when a mu wave strikes
        it. Steady conditions produce no voltage. </p>
      <p>Any steady potential can, it would seem, produce a mu wave
        strikes it. Steady conditions produces no voltage. </p>
      <p>Any steady potential can, it would seem, produce an effect only
        thru, or by means of, resistance. </p>
      <p>Most capacitors have internal resistance, being the resistance
        of the dielectric. This "leakage" current is inseparably linked
        with capacitance "emf" so that the total is either additive or
        substractive. </p>
      <p><i>Page 97.</i> </p>
      <p>In this respect, the deliberate combining of capacitors with
        resistors is probably needless. The resistance of the capacitors
        should suffice to observe cosmic factors. </p>
      <p>A satisfactory circuit may be as follows: </p>
      <center>

      </center>
      <p>The bridge will balance in steady state when the resistances of
        the capacitors match. Any variation on the K ambient will
        immediately create an imbalance, with the capacitance providing
        the rate-of-change potential and the resistance providing
        steady-state effect. </p>
      <p>Higher voltage should provide greater sensitivity. 25 KV
        capacitors are suggested, both oil-filled (Pyramid) and ceramic.
        But matching should be on the basis of resistance, not
        capacitance. </p>
      <p>This circuit (Fig. 1) is a radical departure from that tested
        at Atherton, CA in 1970. See p. 25. </p>

      <p><b><i>109. The Structure of Space and the Significance of K-mu
            Waves.</i></b><a name="109"></a> </p>
      <p>Catalina Island; Sept 7, 1973. </p>
      <p>On p. 92, it was suggested that space, so-called empty space
        may actually have structure. It was inferred that because of
        this structure, manifested as the ability to store energy, that
        light was limited to a certain fixed velocity (c). </p>
      <p>The principal factors of this structure are the twin
        energy-storage means K and mu, being the routes by which
        electric and magnetic energy can be stored as electric and
        magnetic fields respectively. Probably, if it were not for the
        progressive storage of energy, light would have infinite
        velocity. As it is, the progressive delays causes by the
        creation of these "energy pockets", their momentary storage and
        their release from storage limits the speed of light. When these
        pockets increase their capacity, as when K-mu is greater, the
        speed of light is further reduced. This is readily seen when
        light passes thru transparent dielectrics of greater dielectric
        constant (K), such as water. </p>
      <p>Hence, K represents the velocity control produced by the
        temporary storage of the electric (field) component of the
        moving light wave or quantum. </p>
      <p><i>Page 99.</i> </p>
      <p>In the same way, mu represents the control produced by the
        temporary storage of the magnetic (field) component. </p>
      <p>The region of space in this part of our galaxy appears to have
        an average fixed value for both K and mu. This value is referred
        to as "unity". The question arises, is there another region
        somewhere where the value of K and mu is more or less than
        unity? If so, light would have a correspondingly different
        velocity that it has here. It is precisely this velocity change
        that causes the refraction of light. The index of reflection is
        a measure of a differential in K. </p>
      <p>The purpose of this discussion is to set forth the idea that K
        is not necessarily constant in space, nor is mu constant. The
        idea that regions of differing K and mu exist in so-called free
        space has not been accepted in today’s technology. </p>
      <p>Let us postulate the existence of such regions and that they
        may propagate thru space. What would be their velocity? And
        would the velocity necessarily be limited to the speed of light?
        I think not. </p>
      <p><i>Page 100</i> </p>
      <p>K and mu cause light to be velocity. Limited thru the
        application of </p>
      <p>C = sq root K mu, but K and mu are not limited. K and mu may,
        more accurately, be classified as actions at a distance,
        although wavelike characteristics may be present. </p>
      <p>How could such waves be detected? K waves would affect a
        capacitor. Mu waves would affect an inductance. Both would
        generate a voltage change. </p>
      <p>This, in short, is the purpose of performing the bridge
        experiment described in the foregoing sections. A capacitance
        bridge, with arms of differential K, and an inductance bridge,
        with arms of differential mu. Both can be combined in the form
        of a simple bridge, as: </p>

        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/100.jpg" width="715" height="332"></p>
      </center>
      <p>I doubt if a K wave can exist without its counterpart, the mu
        wave. Both are probably effective together. Both probably
        increase and decrease in phase. Otherwise, tank circuits would
        show frequency variations and this, to my knowledge, has never
        been noted. Space vehicles have traveled to Mars, sending back
        telemetric signals which are accurately monitored. No shift in
        frequency has ever been noted, at least to the extent I would
        expect if K and mu varied independently. </p>
      <p><i>Page 101.</i> </p>
      <p>Certain theoretical physicists have considered mass (m) to be
        indicative of gravitation al permeability, just as K represents
        magnetic permeability. The respective fields act upon <i>m</i>,
        K and mu in much the same way. If <i>m</i> is to be considered
        in this light, then it should also appear in with the factors
        describing space. So that the speed of light in free space has
        yet another limiting factor, as: </p>

      <p>Is it possible that the resistive bridge as described on p. 77
        owes its operability upon a mass differential, just as that of
        Fig. 1 (previous page) depends upon K and mu differential (in
        two balanced arms of the resistance bridge) produces a
        consistent effect that is steady state, then it cannot be either
        K or mu. Mass may be the causative factor: K and mu could
        contribute only transient or rate-of-change effects. <i>M</i>
        may produce so-called steady state effects or long-term
        variations. </p>
      <p><i>Page 102.</i> </p>
      <p>Gravitational waves, since they carry energy, probably are
        limited to the velocity of light thru the same mechanism of
        energy storage in space as that caused by K and mu. </p>
      <p>It is difficult to imagine the connection between simple
        electrical resistance and gravitational permeability. It is not
        so difficult to see the connection between capacitance and
        magnetic permeability. Changes in the latter two are revealed
        (in the bridge) as an emf. Could the change in resistance
        actually be the result of a counter emf? </p>
      <p>If a counter emf is generated in a wire, due to cosmic
        variables, it may be masquerading as a change in resistance. One
        would accompany or be indistinguishable from the other. A
        counter emf would impose an electrostatic field longitudinally
        in the wire, or conversely, a generated electrostatic field
        could cause a counter emf. Either way, the very presence of the
        fluid would cause physical (dimensional) distortion in the same
        amount and direction as the field. </p>
      <p>Hence, I am wondering if Weber’s cylinders may not
        contract/extend because of the electrostatic field which
        accompanies the cosmically-induced change of electrical
        resistance. </p>
      <p>In this respect, the Weber cylinder may be functionally similar
        to the resistance cross (p. 71). Unlike the mass-differential
        resistance bridge (p. 77) the resistance cross has the same
        metal (same density) in both arms. The imbalance results from
        the azimuth 90 degrees difference in the direction of the arms.
        So it is with the Weber cylinder. </p>
      <p>The resistance cross (if it proves out) should show a
        resistance imbalance between the N-S arm and the E-W arm. This
        may reveal solar, lunar and sidereal cycles, even secular
        changes which are long-term and comparatively slow-moving.
        Diurnal rhythms, due to the rotation of the Earth, may become
        recognizable. </p>
      <p>Weber’s cylinder, and associated circuitry, is not sufficiently
        sensitive to reveal these slow-moving rhythms. It can only
        indicate shock-induced effects (events) or response to
        frequencies with which the cylinder resonates mechanically. </p>
      <p>The resistance cross, on the other hand, may be infinitely more
        useful because of its great sensitivity to both periodic and
        aperiodic excitation. </p>
      <p>The resistance cross, if it made to be rotatable as a
        turnstile, may show effects similar to the interferometer of
        Miller. In the above discussion of the possibility of an
        electrostatic field accompanying the resistance (mechanically)
        shorten the arm in which the field is longitudinal. This may be
        the mechanism for the Lorentz-Fitzgerald (L-F) contraction. It
        is apparent that the L-F contraction theoretically is not
        adequate --- otherwise Miller would not have obtained consistent
        positive results. An electrostatically driven contraction may be
        adequate. </p>
      <p>Considering further the possible explanation(s) for the change
        in resistance, the idea was explored earlier in this notebook
        that electron density might affect conductivity. Now, if
        contraction occurs due to a longitudinal field in a conductor,
        would not the conductivity increase? It is the electrostatic
        field longitudinally in the conductor that causes the electrons
        to flow. An increase in that field would cause an increase in
        the flow --- hence the conductivity. Increasing the field would
        tend to shorten the wire also, hence the contraction
        longitudinally. </p>
      <p>These are all so-called "steady-state" effects. Mass (m) rather
        than K or mu is the motivating factor. </p>
      <p>At the moment, I am inclined to think of resistance change as
        primarily caused by an emf concurrently with an electrostatic
        field, </p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, being a little more precise with the K and
        mu factors, it would be the electrostatic field which could
        cause the emf in both instances. </p>
      <p>In summary then: </p>
      <p>(1) K ambient change causes an electrostatic field in the
        dielectric which reveals itself as an emf. This is a
        rate-of-change function. Capacitance change. </p>
      <p>(2) Mu ambient changes causes an electrostatic field in
        conductor or the inductor which reveals itself as an emf. This
        is an inductance change. Rate-of-change. </p>
      <p>(3) M ambient change causes an electrostatic field within a
        mass which reveals itself as an emf across the mass which is
        indistinguishable in effect from a change in resistance. Steady
        state. </p>
      <p>Absolute motion (thru space) causes a rod to contract in the
        alignment of the motion. It also causes an electrostatic field
        aligned in the same direction. The field may cause the
        contraction. </p>
      <p>An emf is also generated by the field proportional to the rate
        of motion. If the rod is conducting a current, the emf will
        either aid or hinder such current, the emf will either aid or
        hinder such current. If it aids, the resistance will appear to
        decrease. If it hinders, the resistance will appear to increase.
      </p>
      <p><i>Page 106</i> </p>
      <p>The electrical polarity of the m-induced field will depend upon
        the direction of absolute motion thru space. Subject to
        experimental confirmation, let us assume --- no, on second
        thought, I take this back. We will run into trouble. For the
        time being, we should assume only that contraction takes place,
        and that contraction causes an increase in conductivity or
        decrease in resistance. </p>
      <p>In the case of the resistance cross, the arm in the alignment
        of motion will probably have lower resistance than the
        transverse arm. </p>
      <p>In Fig. 1, p. 79, the alignment of the bridge with absolute
        motion would lower the resistance of the carbon arms with
        respect to the wire-wound arms. </p>
      <p>This is based on the assumption that the low K, low mu, low
        mass arms are more susceptible to the effects of the respective
        ambients. </p>

      <p>It seems important, in arranging the circuit of this bridge
        that the current flows unidirectionally thru the 4 arms of the
        bridge. It would be possible, then, for the electric fields
        within the conductors of all 4 arms to share the same alignment.
        This would seem to be necessary if the device is sensitive to
        the motion of the Earth thru space and/or the direction of the
        galactic center. </p>

      <p>Catalina Island; Sept 11, 1973. </p>
      <p>When one considers that electric permitivity (or dielectric
        constant K) represents the storage of electric energy in space
        and mu (magnetic permeability) represents the storage of
        magnetic energy in space, then the question is: If m represents
        gravitational permeability, how can it also represent the
        storage of gravitational energy in space? </p>
      <p>Let us consider a simple tank circuit, a so-called "ringing
        circuit", consisting of a capacitance, an inductance and, of
        course, an inevitable resistance. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/110a.jpg" width="258" height="148"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Energy storage alternates between the region of A to that of B.
        In A, the storage is enhanced by K, the permitivity of the
        dielectric. In B, it is enhanced by mu, the permeability of the
        core (iron) or the region around B. Also in C, the resistance,
        it could be enhanced by mass m (of the conductor). </p>
      <p><i>Page 111.</i> </p>
      <p>In other words, as viewed from the capacitor’s voltage, the
        energy storage shifts as follows: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/111.jpg" width="753" height="290"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Every 90 degrees, the energy storage shifts from capacitor to
        inductance and return. Resistance enters the picture when
        current is flowing in the conductor (including the winding of
        the inductor). This current is in phase with the magnetic field,
        hence, gravitational storage coincides with magnetic storage. </p>
      <p>Within the capacitor, the leakage current (thru the dielectric)
        is in phase with the voltage across the capacitor, hence,
        gravitational storage coincides with electric storage. </p>
      <p>Therefore, since gravitational storage occurs with both
        electric and magnetic storage, the frequency of grav. storage is
        doubled over the voltage frequency of the tank circuit. However,
        since the electric (field) polarity is reversed with each
        successive grav. storage (both in the capacitor and the rest of
        the circuit), the gravitational vector reverses at the source
        frequency as the tank circuit. </p>

      <p>The gravity vector within the conductor is in the same
        alignment as the flow of electrons (opposite to the "flow" of
        the classical current). </p>
      <p>The complete gravitational field, out into the ambient, may
        look like this: </p>

      <p>The gravity vector within the conductor acts upon the mass (m)
        of the conductor to move it (if free to move) from (-) to (+) as
        indicated above. </p>
      <p><i>Page 113.</i> </p>
      <p>Masses in the ambient, solid, gaseous or liquid, would (if this
        is true) move in the opposite direction. Hence, action and
        reaction would be equal. However, in free space, where there
        would be no masses in the immediate ambient, the quantum arises
        --- would the conductor still possess a "gravitator" force One
        might answer the question in the affirmative by rationalizing
        that the so-called ambient actually extends to infinity so as to
        encompass all mass in the universe! </p>
      <p>In a tank circuit there are three components, (1) the
        capacitor, (2) inductor, ad (3) the leads connecting same. </p>
      <p>Gravitational storage would seem to exist in all three, but not
        necessarily in phase. </p>
      <p>In the capacitor, max. grav. storage exists when the capacitor
        is fully charged. At this point in time, the leakage current is
        maximum across the dielectric. </p>

      <p>Since the dielectric is also the conductor, the gravity
        gradient is from (-) to (+) (electric) and the mass of the
        dielectric is within this concentrated gravity gradient and
        hence processes a force in that direction. Calling such a
        structure a gravitator, (see lab notes of 1926-27-28-29). </p>
      <p><i>Page 114.</i> </p>
      <p>This structure more in the neg to pos direction when charged.
        This is what happened, even in vacuum. </p>
      <p>One of the basic problems in those years was to understand the
        energy relationships. It was not understood that leakage current
        in the dielectric was involved. No distinction was made between
        condensers for this reason. The force developed seemed to be a
        function only of voltage --- hence, wattless. There was no
        understandable channel for the conversion of electrical energy
        into kinetic energy. I was even believed that the kinetic energy
        was somehow derived from the gravitational field! </p>
      <p>Now that we believe the conversion is directly from electrical
        to kinetic energy, the whole idea of the gravitator makes more
        sense. </p>
      <p>In those early experiments, it was known that the gravitator
        force was a function of mass. Lead monoxide loading was common
        practice. The conductivity of the mass was never investigated
        nor appreciated. </p>
      <p>A simple experiment to test the present concept might take any
        of several forms: </p>
      <p>(1) bifilar suspension of a wire conductor; <br>
        (2) bifilar suspension of a massive dielectric rod; <br>
        (3) rotatable (torque) suspension of a coil of wire. </p>

      </center>
      <p>By placing any of the above in an insulating fluid such as oil
        or carbon tetrachloride (more dense), the force may be
        increased. Fluid would move in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p><i>Page 116.</i> </p>
      <p>In the case of a rotor having sectors of different
        conductivity, a net circular current (as in [3], previous page),
        could produce torque on the rotor as a whole. The reaction on an
        ambient mass (such as oil) or on metallic reactor plates would
        be in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>This could represent an additional and quite independent
        explanation for the operation of the sidereal radiation
        electrometer other than that set forth on pages 55 and 80 of
        this notebook. It could be that both explanations apply, each
        one contributing to the torque. </p>
      <p><i>Energy Relationships ~</i> </p>
      <p>At this point, it would appear that the IR loss in a conductor,
        when the conductor is free to move (and does move) is not 100%
        converted into heat. A portion (unknown at this time) is
        converted into kinetic energy. I am not talking about any
        electromagnetic effect but purely about the possible
        electrogravitic interaction. </p>
      <p>The electromagnetic effect would appear to be embodied in a
        semiconductor possessing an internal electric field thru which
        (as a consequence of such field) a current is passing, A gravity
        gradient appears in the alignment of the electron flow. Any mass
        within that gravity gradient tends to "fall" in the same
        direction (as the electron flow). At the positive (elec.)
        terminal of the semi-conductor, the gravity gradient fans out
        into the ambient space to the negative terminal, as show in Fig.
        2, p. 112. </p>
      <p><i>Page 117.</i> </p>
      <p>The gravity gradient(flux) is greatest within the body of the
        semiconductor. The intensity is a function of the potential
        difference and the current. F = || E / || watts. </p>
      <p>Thrust (electrogravitic) is a direct function of the mass of
        the semiconductor; being the effect of the gradient upon the
        body of the semiconductor. This thrust is truly a ponderomotive
        force. </p>
      <p>Semiconductor sections may be placed interrelated with high
        insulation sections as: </p>

      </center>
      <p>All active gravitator sections could be placed in line and
        electrically connected in parallel. </p>

        gravitator sections as: </p>

      <p><i>Page 118</i> </p>
      <p>In developing the concept set forth on p. 110, gravitational
        storage represents the existence of closed flux-domains in
        space. Such domains represent energy. They are formed by
        electric fields and electric currents operating jointly. In
        semiconductors, an electric field (potential difference across
        said conductor) causes the electric current. Both field and
        current are necessary to create the gravity gradient and the
        flux domain. The domain persists so long as the field and
        current persist. When the field collapses, the domain collapses
        and the energy temporarily residing in the domain (if no thrust
        is utilized) returns to the electric field (and circuit). If
        motion is permitted, the energy resident in the domain is
        balanced between kinetic energy and electrical energy when the
        domain collapses. </p>
      <p>Could it be that the motion of the Earth in space changes the
        ratio of electric field and/or conductivity of the
        semiconductor? Could it affect the resistivity of metals for the
        same reason? Could this explain the Miller interferometer fringe
        shift? It is all highly complex to say the least. </p>
      <p>The flux domains resulting from electric magnetic and gravitic
        fields are remarkably similar in pattern and in the way they
        arch out into the ambient. </p>

        (usually wire). Tungsten better than aluminum or carbon. </p>
      <p><i>Page 120.</i> </p>
      <p>Several thoughts occur at this point. First the gravitator
        experiments conducted in the 20’s may no have been too far
        wrong. As stated on p. 114, the need for leakage current as a
        result of the applied high voltage was not understood nor
        appreciated as essential to the operation. </p>
      <p>Lead monoxide was mixed with paraffin or beeswax to obtain a
        massive dielectric for use in the capacitors. The relation to
        gravitation was believed to be solely the function of a
        capacitor. Leakage meant simply a loss. Now, it seems that
        leakage current is as important as the high voltage field, maybe
        more so. </p>
      <p>The high voltage field must be of such intensity as to drive
        the electrons thru the semi-conductor vigorously. Just what is
        required remains to be determined. </p>
      <p>Both field and current are necessary to create a gravity vector
        within the semiconductor. As stated before, this vector is in
        the same direction s the electron flow, i.e., from negative to
        positive. This vector or gravity gradient passing thru the mass
        of the semiconductor causes the conductor to move (when free to
        move) in the same direction (passive grav. mass). </p>
      <p>The gravity gradient then arches out with reduced flux density)
        into the surrounding space and then returns to the opposite
        (negative end) of the semiconductor. The pattern resembles the
        magnetic field around a bar magnet. </p>
      <p><i>Page 121.</i> </p>
      <p>Any mass resident in the ambient part of the gravity field will
        obtain a ponderomotive thrust in the opposite direction. This
        was discussed on p. 112. </p>
      <p>It is possible that such a gravitator may be sensitive to
        "absolute" velocity, the motion of the earth in space. It may
        operate very much like a DC motor, with its motion resulting in
        a generator action – producing a counter emf. </p>
      <p>Such a counter emf would alter the input current, making itself
        evident as a change in input resistance. </p>
      <p>The gravitational permeability of the ambient space would also
        alter the total flux density and it too would make itself
        evident as a change in input resistance. </p>
      <p>At least two factors, therefore, may affect the wattage demand
        of the gravitator: (1) velocity thru space and (2) gravitational
        potential of that region. </p>
      <p>Such a gravitator, fixed to the Earth, would operate, I
        believe, as a sensor for both the movement of the Earth and the
        gravitic potential of the region thru which the earth passes. </p>
      <p>Two additional factors may influence such a sensor, (1) the
        electrostatic charge upon the Earth and (2) the transient
        pulsing or cyclic effect of gravitational waves (possibly from
        the center of our galaxy). </p>
      <p><i>Page 122.</i> </p>
      <p>The electrostatic charge of the Earth would affect the
        conductivity of the semiconductor directly --- increasing
        negativity causing increased conductivity. Note: This could be
        easily checked by an experiment wherein the resistance
        (carbon-metal) bridge is placed upon an insulated island and the
        potential altered several hundred thousand volts. </p>
      <p>The sensitivity to gravity waves is the same as the sensitivity
        to the ambient gravitational potential or flux density. Incoming
        gravity waves affect the gravitic permeability of the ambient
        region, hence the flux density thru the semi-conductor, then the
        counter emf and back to the input resistance or wattage demand.
      </p>
      <p>In 1946, the Giocobini Zinner comet caused rapid erratic
        fluctuations of the electrometer, while the Earth passed thru
        the residue of the comet’s tail. No explanation has been
        advanced. </p>
      <p>I suppose we could speculate that this strange effect was
        caused either by (1) rapid variations of gravitic potential or
        permeability of the ambient region, or (2) variations in the
        electrostatic charge of the Earth, both effects being caused by
        the impingement of particulate matter upon the Earth from the
        comet tail. </p>
      <p><i>Page 123.</i> </p>
      <p>Next March (1974), the earth will pass thru the tail of the
        Kohoutek comet, and I hope to have several resistance bridge
        recorders running, in the hope of getting another look at this
        strange manifestation. </p>
      <p>All of these efforts may help in tying together the theory
        covering the Miller observations, the Sanford experiments on
        resistance, the Weber gravity wave observations (or whatever the
        are) and my own observations for the last 50 years (which have
        never been formally published. </p>
      <p>Today, we have ordered a 2-channel recording galvanometer
        (Brush) with adequate amplifiers to observe the resistance
        variations in several different bridges. Surely, something
        worthwhile will come of all this effort and expense. </p>
      <p>We are also consulting with Dr Pres at Cal Tech and plan to
        have another meeting with him next week, at which time we will
        give him photostats of electrometer records (recently processed)
        covering readings for the ears 1937, 1939, 1946, 1947, 1948, and
        1949. </p>

      <p><b><i>114. A Semiconducting Rod as a Sensor for Earth Movement
            thru Space.</i></b><a name="114"></a> </p>
      <p>Sept 12, 1973. </p>
      <p>On p. 121, it was proposed that the gravitator may be sensitive
        to the absolute motion of the Earth thru space --- inferring as
        to both the direction and extent of that motion. </p>
      <p>The simplicity of this hypothesis is overwhelming and I am
        inclined to carry it further in an attempt to test it ---
        possibly "to absurdity". </p>
      <p>It was stated that, in effect a massive rod would have lower
        resistance, higher wattage demand when aligned with a motion
        vector opposite to its internal electric field (meaning in this
        case the direction of electron flow from neg to pos.). When
        aligned in the same direction as its electric field the
        resistance would increase, resulting in lower wattage demand.
        This then is equivalent to the motor/generator effect where, as
        velocity increases, a counter emf is generated which reduces
        (and even reverses) the wattage demand of the motor. </p>
      <p>Hence, it would seem possible that by merely rotating the
        gravitator (altering its direction in any way) that a change in
        resistance would occur. </p>
      <p><i>Page 125.</i> </p>
      <p>Case #1 --- High wattage demand (low resistance) <br>

      </center>
      <p>Case #2 --- Low wattage demand (high resistance) </p>
      <p>In the above representation, (f) is the ponderomotive force
        resulting from the action of the internal (synthetic) gravitic
        field caused by the joint E1 (electrogravitic) effect. In Case
        1, this force is opposed by the existing motion, so as to cause
        increased wattage demand (lower resistance), whereas in Case 2,
        the existing motion is assisting so as to cause lower wattage
        demand or higher resistance. </p>
      <p>This "directional sensor" capability was referred to on p. 84
        and may be tested shortly when suitable resistance units become
        available. </p>
      <p>If this concept is valid, it may offer some explanation for the
        behavior of the Miller interferometer. Although the steel arms
        of the interferometer were not charged, nor were they given any
        electric gradient deliberately, the intermolecular structure of
        the steel may have developed such gradient by electrogravitic
        (more precisely gravito-electric) induction from its motion thru
        space. This may have caused inter-molecular contraction.
        Perhaps, this may turn out to be the mechanism of the L-F
        Contraction. </p>
      <p>But why the Miller effect exceeded the theoretical L-F
        contraction or (more exactly) was only about 1/20 of the total
        expected shift, all of which should have been cancelled by the
        L-F contraction, remains unexplained. The relativists are simply
        ignoring it! </p>
      <p>Then, of course, the systematic and cyclic change in resistance
        observed in 1892 by Sanford appears never to have been seriously
        considered. To my knowledge, few (if any) physicists today have
        ever heard of Sanford’s results or, for that matter, would
        consider them valid if the subject were brought up. For such
        reasons, difficult to understand, the ideas presented in this
        book will undoubtedly be classed as rank heresy. But we hope
        this will not alter the truth, which will eventually emerge.
        Only time will tell. </p>
      <p>Now comes the controversy regarding the validity of Weber’s
        work allegedly purported to have observed gravity waves --- now,
        more particularly the effects correlated with sidereal time.
        Weber has stated he believes he has been receiving gravity
        radiation from the galactic center. </p>
      <p>If our electrometer records for 1937 and 1939 are considered in
        the same light, we also might make the same claim that radiation
        was being received from the galactic center. </p>
      <p>But the question I raise at this time is --- Does velocity (of
        the Earth) thru space contribute? Could the Earth be running
        thru regions of varying gravitational potential such as may
        result from clouds of dust, variations in the density of the
        solar wind, etc. If the gravito-electric concept is valid and
        electric fields are intimately tied in with gravitational
        potential, what of possible variations in the electrostatic
        charge of the Earth --- and/or the Earth-Moon system. </p>
      <p>Why is it that the electrometer, consistently for 6 years, has
        shown an effect readily correlated with the phases of the Moon?
      </p>
      <p>Weber’s equipment records only "events", sudden shock stimuli
        which cause his cylinders to resonate mechanically. Of course,
        as Weber reasons, the stimuli could also be the arrival of a
        wave of that same frequency. Perhaps evidence, even, of a
        "whistler" train of waves of varying frequency which resonate
        (at one point) with the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Could it be that Weber’s cylinder, longitudinally and
        transversely, resembles Miller’s interferometer arms? Did
        Miller’s "arms" respond to gravity waves? </p>
      <p><i>Page 128.</i> </p>
      <p>To my knowledge, Miller reported no sudden fringe shifts such
        as Weber might call an "event". If he had, he may have
        attributed it to an earthquake! </p>
      <p>The interferometer has the advantage over the Weber cylinder,
        of providing "steady state" readings. The electrometer has the
        same advantage. The resistance bridge likewise has this
        advantage, and with a possible sensitivity many orders of
        magnitude greater. </p>
      <p>I can see a similarity, both in structure and function, between
        the four instruments mentioned above. All appear to depend upon
        the same set of phenomena, the relationship between electric and
        gravitational fields. Of the four, I like the resistance bridge
        (differential mass) the best and feel it has the most to offer
        in the future </p>
      <p>I certainly hope we can proceed without delay to build and test
        various bridge and various resistive elements in the light of
        this new concept. </p>
      <p>Possibly not only will the results add greatly to the fund of
        scientific knowledge but may provide new devices for
        astronomical measurements and new methods, such as the
        gravitator, for commercial utility. </p>

      <p>On p. 125, the possibility that a resistor may be sensitive to
        absolute motion was considered. If the resistor were aligned
        with the motion, it is suggested that the resistance would

        the absolute motion of the Earth thru space. (This, of course,
        is impossible in the view of today’s technology). </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, method No. 1 may take the form of a resistive
        bridge where similar arms carry currents in opposite directions,
        as: </p>

      </center>
      <p>Here, the resistance balance is established between pairs of
        arms where current is flowing in opposite directions. </p>
      <p>The receding would be maximum when the resistors were aligned
        with the movement and minimum when at right angles to the
        movement. </p>
      <p><i>Page 130.</i> </p>
      <p>The practical value of such an instrument would be enormous,
        especially in this age of space travel. It would be, in effect,
        a compass for space, unaffected by the magnetic field of the
        Earth. Not only that, it would confirm (finally) the earth’s
        movement away from the galactic center toward that point in
        space (as Miller believed) approx 5h RA –70 Decl. at about 208
        km/sec. </p>
      <p>Method No. 2. </p>
      <p>If resistance changes with polarity, according to the original
        premise, the in-alignment resistor will act as a rectifier, as:

      </center>
      <p>The greater the resistance differential the greater will be the
        indicated voltage DC. No motion, hence, no resistance
        differential would produce no DC voltage. While the circuit
        illustrate above contributes a half-wave rectifier, the same
        principles apply to a full wave rectifier (by using 4 – 2 pairs
        --- of resistors properly aligned). A capacitor is shown merely
        to smooth the DC output. </p>

      <p><b><i>117. Variations in Resistance Bridge Output.</i></b><a name="117"></a> </p>
      <p>Sept 16, 1973. </p>
      <p>Containing the observations started Sept 8 (p. 107) two systems
        are now operating: </p>
      <p>No. 1 --- 10,000 ohm --- 19 V, Output ~ 10 ua. <br>
        No. 2 --- 200,000 ohm --- 38 V, Output ~ 10 ua. </p>
      <p>The former is connected to indicate conductivity while the
        latter indicates resistance of the wire-wound arms. Observations
        to date show a true reciprocal relationship. Continuous
        variations in readings are readily apparent, some rather rapid
        fluctuations are occasionally seen, but these are of such small
        magnitude that exceedingly close observation of the 0-50 ua
        meter is necessary to detect them. </p>
      <p><i>Page 132</i> </p>
      <p>Tomorrow, I understand, the 2-channel Brush recording
        galvanometer will be delivered and this instrument will have
        such amplification and sensitivity that these rapid fluctuations
        will be ready observed and recorded. </p>
      <p>At 10:05 pm, I happened to be watching the meter with a
        magnifying glass and saw a sudden jump from 9.95 to 10.03 ua,
        fluctuating at the high level for about 30 sec then returning
        the former reading. There is no question that rapid fluctuations
        exist. The Brush will be able to record anything up to 100 Hz.
        If higher frequencies are present, it will require a scope.
        Also, if there are frequencies in the audible range, a suitable
        amplifier and loudspeaker may provide some fascinating
        information. Even the variations as I have just witnessed may be
        audible. The next two or three weeks (when we have the proper
        equipment) will certainly be interesting. </p>
      <p>The microammeters used in this experiment (p. 107) are 1800
        ohms. Maximum deflections so far has been 9.5 to 10.0 ua or 0.5
        ua = 0.0009 V or approx 1 mV. The Brush recorder therefore
        should have ample sensitivity. Also an audio amplifier, using
        the crystal microphone pickup, should provide adequate
        amplification for ~ 1 mV. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Sept 17, 1973. </p>
      <p>On the premise that the variation in resistance is "felt" by
        the more massive conductor (wire-wound arms) primarily when the
        conductor is in the alignment of absolute motion, the following
        thoughts emerge: </p>
      <p>(1) The flow of current (in the conductor) is in the alignment
        with the absolute motion. </p>
      <p>(2) Current vector and velocity vector are unidirectional. </p>
      <p>A velocity vector sensor may, therefore, have this circuit. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebooks,%20Vol%202_files/133.jpg" width="351" height="412"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the above circuit, current flow in the carbon resistors is
        in opposite directions (canceling) while that in the wire-wound
        resistors is unidirectional. It is the thought that the
        indicating meter will read maximum or minimum when the
        wire-wound arms of the bridge are aligned with the earth’s
        movement, thru space, and only when so aligned. </p>
      <p>As to whether it will be maximum or minimum, an analysis is as
        follows: </p>
      <p>(1) Based on the counter emf theory (p. 124), when current flow
        (opposite to electron flow). </p>
      <p>(2) The meter reading, therefore, would be maximum when the
        wire-wound arms and the current in those arms is in the same
        direction as the absolute motion. </p>
      <p>(3) Hence, such a bridge would "point" in the same direction
        that the Earth is moving. It would be a kind of "Space Compass".
        It is entirely possible that the current or energy asymmetry may
        introduce a torque on a carefully balanced system so that the
        system would actually align itself at a position of minimum
        current flow. </p>
      <p>(4) In summary then, such a space compass would align itself so
        that the positive end "points" in the direction the Earth is
        moving in space. </p>
      <p>I am wondering if this may not be as Miller predicts: 5h RA –70
        Decl. (See p. 130). </p>
      <p><i>Page 135.</i> </p>
      <p>The basic diagram of such a system where current asymmetry
        provides mechanical torque so that the space compass actually
        aligns itself toward the point in space toward which the earth
        is moving is: </p>

      </center>
      <p>Mounting has 3 degrees of freedom. </p>
      <p>This is predicted on the belief that a counter emf is generated
        in an y conductor or semiconductor, with polarity as indicated
        above, when it is moved longitudinally. If that conductor is
        carrying a current, the resistance will be increased and the
        current will drop to a minimum. </p>

      <p><b><i>118. Results of Tests of Models A-14, 15 and 16.</i></b><a name="118"></a> </p>
      <p>Nov 9, 1973. </p>
      <p>It is now quite apparent that the bridge structure outlined on
        p. 79 is operative. The results are quite surprising as to
        magnitude. The two arms of the bridge are of wire-wound and
        carbon composition resistors of approximately the same
        resistance. It is adjusted at the start to a null voltage which
        is fed to both strip-chart recorder and a visual digital
        readout. </p>
      <p>Three models have been constructed. A-14 (45 V at 600 K), A-15
        (300 V at 1.2 megs) and A-16 (6 V at 10 K). All units are
        running concurrently. Records for the past two weeks indicate a
        consistent drift downward on all three units; i.e., toward the
        negative on the charts (which probably means that the Earth is
        becoming increasingly electropositive). </p>
      <p>It has not yet been determined which arm of the bridge is
        changing the more, the wire-wound arm (sp. gr. 7.8), or carbon
        comp. (sp. gr.2.0). I suspect that it is the carbon side. And I
        am wondering why this variation has not been discovered before
        this or predicted in resistance theory. </p>
      <p><i>Page 137.</i> </p>
      <p>While all three models indicate a common trend, there are
        individual consistent differences which were not foreseen. These
        differences must be explained. They obviously are not sporadic
        or random. </p>
      <p>When one examines the basic differences in the construction of
        the three models, it appears that voltage (applied) and
        resistance are the only operating factors. Hence, one might
        classify the three models as follows: </p>
      <p>Model --- V x R (voltohms) <br>
        A-16 --- 6 x 10<sup>4</sup> <br>
        A-14 --- 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> <br>
        A-15 --- 3.6 x 10<sup>8</sup> </p>
      <p>If voltage represents the "driving" field which acts upon the
        conducting electrons and R represents the "distance" or gradient
        thru which this force acts, then F<sub>d</sub> = work or energy.
        Hence, it is possible these three models operate at three
        different energy levels, perhaps some kind of quantum
        relationship. </p>
      <p>If this is found to be the case, we might actually have the
        evidence for many energy level, only three of which we may have
        identified. </p>
      <p>Following this line of reasoning, there may be a series of
        so-called "spectral bands" in this newly-discovered phenomenon,
        expressed as follows: </p>
      <p><i>Page 138</i> </p>
      <p>Spectral Bands (energy levels) <br>
        Exponent ( V x R ) --- Model <br>
        +10&nbsp; --- A-17 <br>
        +9 --- A-17 <br>
        +8 --- A-15 <br>
        +7 --- A-14 <br>
        +6 --- A-14 <br>
        +5 --- A-14 <br>
        +4 --- A-16 <br>
        +3 --- A-16 <br>
        +2 --- A-16 <br>
        +1 --- A-16 <br>
        0 --- A-18 <br>
        -1 --- A-18 <br>
        -2 --- A-18 <br>
        -3 --- A-19 </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is now proposed that we construct Model A-17
        with a total R = 10 megaohms and V = 1 KV. </p>
      <p>Also Model A-18 --- R = 1 ohm, V = 1.5 (battery) </p>
      <p>These models will be constructed in the Menlo Park shop
        (Polytec) during the week of Dec 3, 1973. </p>
      <p>Additional recording and printout instruments are being
        installed and will be operational during the week of Nov 12 and
        thereafter. </p>
      <p>More definitive information will become available. </p>

      <p><b><i>119. Conductor Density and Resistance Variation</i></b><a name="119"></a> </p>
      <p>Nov 9, 1973. </p>
      <p>Contrary to the opinion expressed on p. 136, a provisional
        examination of the circuit and performance of Model A-15 appears
        to indicate that the wire-wound resistors, rather than the
        carbon-comp. resistors, are responsible (largely) for the
        anomalous resistive variation which the bridge detects. </p>
      <p>This would bear out the hypothesis that the bridge functions
        because of a mass differential of the two arms. Here, the
        density of the wire (arm) is 7.8 whereas that of the carbon
        (arm) is approx 2.0 --- a differential of 5.8. It is believed
        that the carbon (low mass) arm holds relatively steady while the
        iron (high mass) arm suffers a (larger) change, a spreading due
        mainly to the higher-density arm. This is certainly evidence of
        a gravitational relation. </p>
      <p>In the Sanford experiments (p. 63), measurements were made of a
        copper wire vs (it is assumed) an iron-wire resistance decade
        box. Therefore, the copper (sp. gr. 9.0)is measured against iron
        (sp. gr. 7.8) --- differential 1.2. Both iron and copper would
        vary in resistance, but the variation in copper would be the
        greater. </p>
      <p><i>Page 140</i> </p>
      <p>An experiment is planned (p. 77) using platinum or tungsten
        wire-wound resistors. Here, the mass differential would be
        appreciable --- approx 16 gr/cm<sup>3</sup>. It is supposed that
        the tungsten would show the greater resistance variation. This
        combination would be superior to the iron-carbon combination by
        a factor of about 3. </p>
      <p>In the use of tungsten wire in velocity sensors (p. 129) it is
        preferred for the same reason. </p>
      <p>Aluminum wire, it seems, would be preferred over carbon-comp.
        because of its greater stability and freedom from resistor
        noise. However, since the drawing of aluminum into very fine
        wire is difficult (smallest size approx 0.001 inch) the higher
        resistance bobbins are quite large. Where size is no problem,
        aluminum wire resistors have a definite advantage. Therefore,
        the combination of tungsten with aluminum is preferred. </p>
      <p>Assuming that tungsten (or the more massive wire) is primarily
        receptive to these strange newly-discovered resistance changes,
        one may draw certain conclusions regarding sensor performance
        which are based on observations over many years. Some of these
        conclusions are as follows: </p>
      <p>(1) Resistance decreases as the original electrometer readings
        increase. <br>
        (2) Resistance decreases as Earth negative charge increases. <br>
        (3) Decreases as moon crosses upper meridian. <br>
        (4) Decreases at 16h ST (Ohio 1937) <br>
        (5) Decreases to minimum 4 days after full moon. <br>
        (6) Elevation ? </p>
      <p>The above may be subject to correction or revision as further
        evidence comes from alternate records. </p>
      <p><i>Summary:</i> </p>
      <p>Based on the above, but still subject to confirmation, the
        possibilities are as follows: </p>
      <p>(1) There exists a basic change in electrical resistance to
        which all conductors are subject which has an extra-terrestrial
        origin. </p>
      <p>(2) The magnitude of this change appears to be dependent only
        upon the mass or density of the conductor, the more dense or
        massive the greater the magnitude of the resistance change. </p>
      <p>(3) Platinum has roughly 10 times the variation to which
        (porous) carbon is subject. </p>
      <p>(4) Resistance bridges made of platinum vs carbon-composition
        resistor arms easily reveal this extra-terrestrial effect. </p>
      <p>(5) Other optimum combinations are gold-aluminum or
        tungsten-aluminum. </p>
      <p>(6) The electrostatic charge upon the conductor also influences
        its conductivity. </p>
      <p>(7) Electro-negativity lowers resistance or increases
        conductivity. </p>
      <p>(8) Electron density probably is responsible so that increase
        in (free) electron population increases conductivity. </p>
      <p>(9) The Earth, being an insulated sphere in space, is free to
        accept, maintain and/or vary its electrostatic charge. </p>
      <p>(10) Influenced to a great extent by solar wind, this charge
        may vary over wide limits. It appears probable that the earth is
        positively charged relative to the Sun (Sanford). </p>
      <p>(11) This may be due in part to the gravito-electric
        equilibrium whereby the gravitational potential of the sun
        induces an (equivalent) negative electric potential on the Sun.
      </p>
      <p>(12) If the Earth’s orbital position (ambient) has (in my view)
        a higher gravitational potential, then the Earth would have a
        positive potential relative to the Sun. </p>
      <p>(13) Earth’s position relative to the Sun (perigee and apogee)
        would vary the electrical potential of the Earth because of the
        corresponding change in gravitational potential. </p>
      <p>(14) At full moon, the moon would be more positive than the
        Earth for the same reason. At new moon more negative. </p>
      <p>(15) The moon, therefore, undergoes a cyclic electrical
        potential change in concurrence with its phases, sweeping from
        maximum positive to max neg and return, with the potential of
        the Earth remaining near the mean. </p>
      <p>(16) Actually, the above is an over-simplification. The
        earth-Moon system has a center of gravity (supposed to be approx
        1000 miles beneath the surface of the Earth) about which both
        bodies rotate. </p>
      <p>(17) The moon may induce an opposite charge on the surface of
        the earth closest to it. As the earth revolves this surface
        charge may travel from E to W, producing a diurnal change in
        surface potential at any one location. </p>
      <p>(18) This diurnal pattern will change from day to day depending
        upon the phase of the moon. </p>
      <p>(19) At or shortly after full moon the observed pattern (Ohio
        1937) is an increase in (resistor) conductivity, hence electric
        negativity. The low appears about 4 days after new moon. </p>
      <p>(20) This delay of approx 4 days in each instance may be caused
        by the capacitance lag of both the moon and the Earth. </p>
      <p>(21) It must be borne in mind that the electrical capacitance
        of the Earth is enormous --- estimated at about 1 farad. Such
        capacitance undoubtedly has a tendency to smooth out all
        electrostatic variations, as well as to introduce a time lag. </p>
      <p>(22) To date, the readings of all three resistance bridges in
        operation (Models A-14, 15 and 16) have shown a consistent drop.
        This means lowered negativity and lowered conductivity. </p>
      <p>(23) If bio-electric relations exist, this probably means
        lowered mitotic rate possibly leading to lowered psychic and
        physical well-being in humans, and hence, a lowered stock
        market. </p>
      <p>(24) Such a relation may indicate that the membranes between
        living cells, which act as electrical living cells, which act as
        electrical conductors between cells, perform their functions
        better when their electrical conductivity increases. A decrease
        in conductivity, on the other hand, would cause a loss of body
        energy. This would seem to be the logic of this "radiation"
        effect on human beings. </p>
      <p>(25) As to the relation of human affairs to the moon, full moon
        again seems to have an effect on human activity. Chronic
        illnesses, hospital attendance, mental institutions, police
        activity, all have known correlations. Even the words "lunatic"
        or "looney" seem to show that this effect has been known and
        recognized for a long time. </p>
      <p>(26) If resistor sensitivity to this phenomenal variation is,
        in fact, a function of the mass of the resistor material, there
        may be materials lighter than carbon in which the sensitivity
        may be minimum, possibly zero --- a material which is stable.
        However, such light materials (if metals) are chemically
        dangerous to handle, such as lithium, potassium, sodium or
        magnesium. </p>
      <p><i>Page 145.</i> </p>
      <p>A better avenue of investigation would be electrolytes or
        liquids (semiconductors) of specific gravity les than one. </p>
      <p>(27) Leaky oil (transformer oil containing moisture) would be a
        possibility. It will be recalled that leaky oil was used in the
        electrometer (1937) where this effect was first observed for a
        full year. </p>
      <p>(28) Bridge arms of platinum vs leaky oil would appear to have
        maximum effect. Damp pine wood or balsa may be equally
        effective. </p>
      <p>(29) And this brings to mind the possibilities of low-density
        solutions wherein the conductivity is the result of ion
        mobility. </p>
      <p>(30) The question then is whether ion populated density also
        varies as free electron density is believed to vary. If it does
        not, then any ion-conductance arm (of a bridge) would be an
        excellent zero reference against which to measure the anomalous
        resistance change of all electron-conductance materials
        including all the metals. </p>
      <p>(31) Another interesting avenue of investigation is the
        relation of this phenomenal variation of resistance to
        superconductors --- specifically, to the transition Temperature
        T<sub>c</sub>. It as already been observed that different
        isotopes of the same superconductor showed that T<sub>c</sub> is
        proportional to M<sup>-1/2</sup>, where M is the isotopic mass!
        Could it be that T<sub>c</sub> (of a given superconductor)
        varies with extra-terrestrial factors, possibly gravitational
        and/or electrostatic potential? </p>
      <p><i>Page 146.</i> </p>
      <p>Are the investigators of superconductivity aware of an
        anomalous changes in T<sub>c</sub> (cyclic or secular
        variations)? Surely, the resistance changes so apparent (in our
        results) at room temperature must extend into the low
        temperature region. One would naturally expect to find anomalous
        variations in the superconductivity transition temperature. </p>
      <p>(32) In all of the observations of this anomalous variation of
        resistance made to date. DC has been used. The resistance
        bridges have all been battery-powered. It must be bore in mind
        that AC bridges are equally effective if this is truly a
        resistance effect. The variations from null are similar to the
        straight DC system. </p>
      <p>(33) One important difference might be foreseen. If the
        incoming "cause" of the resistance change is alternating, rather
        than steady, the rectified null voltage as measured on our
        readouts would show it as DC. We would not be able to discern an
        AC "cause" of high frequency. </p>
      <p>(34) The inductance of our wire-wound resistors, together with
        the inter-winding capacitance could be resonant, so that Model
        A-14, A-15 and A-16 may all have different resonant frequencies,
        hence, different spectral sensitivities. </p>
      <p>(35) Evidence of differing readout characteristics has already
        been observed, especially between A-14 and A-15. </p>
      <p><i>Page 147.</i> </p>
      <p>If all models (so far operated) were merely recording a scalar
        value such as a flux density, all would follow exactly the same
        pattern, This is not the case. </p>
      <p>Disregarding a vector effect (alignment of the wire-wound
        resistors) or azimuth sensitivity, the readings of the three
        instruments are not strictly parallel. All, so far, have had a
        significant downward trend, which obviously is not localized
        within each instrument, but is shared by all. </p>
      <p>Individual differences persist however. So that it has been
        convenient to assume that each is operating on a different
        "channel" or spectrum band, depending on some factor or
        combination of factors within each instrument. </p>
      <p>The only factors which are different and distinguish one sensor
        from another are voltages and resistance. Both may be involved.
        Hence we have come to classify the sensors as follows: </p>
      <p>Model A-14 --- 50 V x 600,000 ohms = 3 x 10<sup>7</sup>. <br>
        Model A-15 --- 300 V x 1,200,000 ohms = 3.6 x 10<sup>8</sup>. <br>
        Model A-16 --- 6 V x 10,000 ohms = 6 x 10<sup>4</sup>. </p>
      <p>But it is still quite puzzling why distinct channels exist. Is
        it a resonant effect somehow in tune with incoming natural
        frequencies? But frequencies in what? </p>
      <p>Studies should be made, using signal generators both in the
        audio and RF bands, to determine if these models are resonant. </p>
      <p><i>Page 148.</i> </p>
      <p>This determination, it seems to me, is vital to the future of
        the research in this field. We must find out why the several
        models, each one quite positive in is reading, are slightly
        different from one another. </p>
      <p>One thought is that they each respond t a different energy
        level --- but again, energy level in what? If resonance is not
        involved, it is extremely difficult to understand how energy
        levels could be present. Obviously, the problem is not simple.
        We seem to have a "bear by the tail". </p>
      <p>Assuming for the moment that resonance is involved, the
        following thought occur to me: </p>
      <p>(1) Resonant frequency must depend upon voltage and/or
        resistance, as f || V ohm. </p>
      <p>(2) Based upon the idea of resistor inductance and its relation
        to frequency, the higher the voltohms, the lower the frequency,
        A voltohm-to-frequency scale might be as follows: </p>
      <p>LF: 10<sup>10</sup> voltohms <br>
        10<sup>8</sup> <br>
        10<sup>6</sup> <br>
        10<sup>4</sup> <br>
        HF: 10<sup>2</sup> <br>
        0 <br>
        10<sup>2</sup> <br>
        VF: 10<sup>4</sup> </p>
      <p>With frequency increasing as VOhm drops. </p>

            the Electrostatic Potential.</i></b><a name="120"></a> </p>
      <p>Nov 11, 1973. </p>
      <p>In the previous sections, it was suggested that the reading of
        these sensors would be related to the electrostatic potential of
        the Earth. It is believed that the resistance of the more
        massive wire (arm of the bridge) decreases as the potential of
        the Earth increase. Or, in the other words, wire conductivity is
        directly related to electro-negativity. The reasoning behind
        this is that free-electron density increases conductivity. </p>
      <p>A laboratory test of this premise is easily performed, as: </p>

      </center>
      <p>Negative output of power supply should increase reading,
        positive output decrease it. </p>
      <p>This method may be used to calibrate all sensors. </p>

      <p><b><i>121. Electron Mobility and the Role of Phonons.</i></b><a name="121"></a> </p>
      <p>Nov 13, 1973. </p>
      <p>The thinking expressed in earlier sections of this record book
        that electrical conductivity is primarily a function of electron
        density is only partly true. Other factors affect the migration
        of electrons (electron mobility) beside density. One of the
        flow-controlling factors is the density and energy of the
        phonons which are present. </p>
      <p>Phonons have distinct energy levels which are related to their
        momentum. Collision with electrons may transfer this momentum to
        the electron thereby increasing the electron’s mobility, hence
        charge transfer. The energy of the phonon may be expressed as E
        = hw, a momentum <i>g</i> and velocity <i>V</i>. </p>
      <p>The observed behavior, so far, of Model A-16 (6 V x 10,000
        ohms) indicated a step phenomenon. The voltage balance of the
        bridge, near null, at approx 0.009 V goes by steps. The voltage
        value of these steps is yet to be determined. This could be
        evidence of a quantized behavior of the phonons. </p>
      <p>Another interesting behavior pattern of A-16 is the jump ---
        and groups of jumps. Each jump approx 0.001 V. Groups of jumps
        occurred near noon Nov 14 and again in the early evening about
        sunset. The nature of these jumps indicates that they are not
        random electrostatic discharges near the equipment (frictional
        electricity from the wool carpet, etc.) but are definitely
        related to the quantum voltage levels in the resistor (sensor).
        The action looks like a charge-transfer avalanche. Initiated by
        a factor, as yet unidentified, the conductivity suddenly jumps
        (increases) approx 1/10 of the full (recorder) scale, then
        decays back to its former level. No new jump occurs until the
        voltage returns to its previous starting level. A change in the
        starting level (or return level) sometimes precludes further
        jumps. </p>
      <p>These jumps are sometimes quite rare, sometimes very frequent,
        sometimes singly and sometimes in a long series --- not
        necessarily at regular intervals. </p>
      <p>We will watch the A-16 recorder for further characteristics. It
        is noted that A-14 also engages in jumping, sometimes randomly,
        sometimes in groups, but always quite irregular in timing. There
        is no (as yet) correlation between the jumps of A-14 and A-16.
        No concurrent jumps so far have been observed. This seems to
        eliminate the possibility of scales flux as a cause, seeming to
        point up the possibility of distinct spectral bands or channels.
        However, the underlying flux density does seem to affect all
        three sensors in the same way. All the sensors have shown a
        consistent drift downward (increasing conductivity) in the last
        three weeks. </p>
      <p><i>Page 152.</i> </p>
      <p><b><i>122. Momentary Losses of Electrical Conductivity.</i></b><a name="122"></a> </p>
      <p>Nov 15, 1973. </p>
      <p>The jumps of Model A-16 are not apparently caused by increases
        in conductivity (as at first believed --- p. 151) but are
        "jumps" in resistivity. Rather than being produced&nbsp; by a
        avalanche of charge carriers (electrons) they must be produced
        by a sudden lessening of charge carriers; that is, a sudden
        lessening of charge carriers; that is, a sudden increase in
        resistance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;A factor must come in from space which suddenly increases
        electrical resistance in a susceptible channel (in the observed
        case, it is spectral band +4, which is 6 V x 10,000 ohms ---
        Model A-16). The inhibiting factor must be of very short
        duration --- possibly a millisecond or less. The recording
        galvanometer presently in use (Monsanto Model 531-A) is much too
        slow to respond to the full magnitude of the resistance
        "glitch". </p>
      <p>At first thought, it was believed these "glitches" might be
        ionization bursts from cosmic ray showers, but ionization bursts
        produce increased conductivity, not increased resistivity. We
        must look for extra-terrestrial factors of extremely short
        duration which temporarily "paralyzes" electrical transmission.
