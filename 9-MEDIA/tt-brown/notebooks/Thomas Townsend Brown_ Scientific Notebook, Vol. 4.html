    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">During my absence from the Haleakala
      Observatory (trip to the mainland Dec 17 ’74 to Jan 16 ’75) the
      automatic computer was continued in operation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Readouts showed a sudden and intense
      disturbance on all sensors beginning at (or shortly after 1 AM
      Honolulu 150 Degrees time on Dec 21, 1974, and lasting approx 3
      hours. On certain sensors the effect lasted several days. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another disturbance, also sudden and
      intense, occurred beginning at, or shortly after, 7 AM Honolulu
      time, on Jan 7, 1975. This disturbance, on certain sensors, also
      lasted several days. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, HI; Jan 28, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One cannot patent a rock, even if the
      rock generates electricity! But one can patent a circuit using a
      resistor, a method patent, if the results represent a new and
      useful application. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, it is appropriate at this point
      to illustrate a series of basic circuits which might form the
      fundamentals leading to patent protection. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In certain special cases where the
      resistive materials, like granitic rocks, are electrically
      polarized, the diode rectifiers need not be used, but their use
      does not detract in such cases. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Even with granitic rocks, which
      basically act as gravito-electric receptors, and are slightly
      polarized naturally, the use of the diode improves performance as
      an electrical energy source. The method therefore includes the 3
      circuit elements, resistor, diode and (storage) capacitor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 4</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In describing the operation of this
      form of electric generator, it s believed that the resistor (any
      high resistance) intercepts radiation from the ambient (possibly
      gravitational radiation from space) and then coverts the incoming
      energy to RF (broad noise spectrum) intrinsically within the body
      of the resistive material. This RF noise appears at the terminals
      of the resistor or at the sides of the granite block (for example)
      to which electrodes have been attached. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This RF is then rectified by the diode
      and the DC is stored in the capacitor. The terminals of the
      storage capacitor provide the output leads of the "generator". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As mentioned earlier in these notes,
      certain granitic rocks appear to be electrically polarized and put
      out DC without the aid of an external diode. The rectifying action
      obviously takes place within the body of the rock. It is not
      conceivable that the DC output could in any way originate
      externally if one assume the source is gravitational (or other)
      high frequency radiation. No external DC source, such as
      atmospheric electric fields, appears to be operative. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A suggested method claim may be: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Method for generating electricity,
      consisting in utilizing a circuit containing a resistor, diode and
      capacitor, connecting the same in series, and exposing said
      circuit to an ambient energy source. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 5.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) An electric generator comprising a
      circuit containing a high resistance, a diode rectifier and a
      storage capacitor whereby an electrical potential difference is
      created and stored for use. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) A generator according to claim 2
      utilizing a body of resistive materials as the high resistance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(4) A generator according to claim 2
      utilizing granitic material as the high resistance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(5) A generator according to claim 2
      wherein the diode rectifier is an integral part of the polarized
      resistive material. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(6) A generator according to claim 2
      wherein polarizable resistive material possesses capacitance. </p>

          Voltage Output by Passing Current through Resistors.</i></b><a name="181"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, HI; 1-29-75. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the foregoing section, the only
      current which passed thru the resistors was that which was
      self-polarized. Aside from the RF current itself, the only other
      current was DC from the diode action. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The thought occurs that if this
      phenomenon is rooted in resistor noise (from whatever source), it
      may be increased by increasing the (bias) current thru the
      resistor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, the following circuit should be
      considered: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p6.jpg" width="617" height="322"></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>182. The Effects of High
          Temperature.</i></b><a name="182"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu; 2-2-75. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All the sensors seem to have
      temperature effects, some rather unpredictable. This is the reason
      we have preferred to place the sensors in a temperature-controlled
      cabinet. Under constant temperature, the observed variation in
      voltage output were believed more clearly to reflect the
      variations in the ambient radiation, whether gravitational or
      otherwise. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In general, it appears to e noted that
      voltage output increases with temperature. If this were the result
      of thermal noise, the additional output may be directly traced to
      the incident (incoming) thermal energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If, however, the increase in
      temperature produces an increased susceptance to the incoming
      gravitational radiation, then higher temperature brings about
      increased gravito-electric conversion efficiency, and higher
      readings are the result. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">No critical tests of this possibility
      have been made. The thought is being presented here merely in
      regard to increasing sensor (converter) output or efficiency. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Going further along this line, it is
      proposed that high temperature rock tests are in order. How high
      to go is a matter of speculation. Do red hot rocks produced high
      output voltages? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 8.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The answer is important in connection
      with "in-hole" generation of electricity from dry-rock geothermal
      reservoirs. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To date, all extraction of energy from
      geothermal sources comes about thru the emission and harnessing of
      steam or hot water. No method seems to be available for the direct
      conversion of in-hole heat to electricity. Ordinary thermoelectric
      generators require both hot and cold junctions. To my present
      knowledge, there is no (single) hot junction thermoelectric
      converter available. It is thought here that red hot rocks may do
      this kiNd of job. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, could it be that hot rocks
      (with suitable electrodes attached) may generate RF which could be
      conducted away (by coaxial cable) and subsequently rectified? Not
      only would such a system completely revolutionize the concept of
      obtaining geothermal energy but it would have many other
      applications as well. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Commercial generating stations today
      use fuel (coal, gas, oil, etc.) to generate steam which then runs
      turbines and electric generators. Converting heat directly into
      electricity would eliminate the steam step and conceivably
      increase efficiency substantially. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>&nbsp;Page 9.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Systems would be as follows: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p9.jpg" width="670" height="807"></center>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>183. Re-Emission of Radiant
          Energy by Masses.</i></b><a name="183"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, Feb 7, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec 173 of Notebook #2, I discussed
      the possibility that various regions of the Earth’s surface may be
      radiating energy. This radiation may be gravitational or it may be
      something else not yet identified or recognized. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This hypothesis has grown out of the
      strange behavior of the rock sensors in various location, or when
      moved from place to place. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When one considers that a single rock
      generates an emf which is conducted away, it means that energy is
      being removed from the rock. If the rock is to remain stable as to
      its energy content, it must receive energy at the same rate it is
      losing energy. Hence, there must be incoming radiation. This, I
      believe, is basic. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, if the electrical current is
      opened, so that no electrical energy is conducted away from the
      rock, then the internal energy of the rock builds up to a
      saturation point. Either it must at this point, refuse or reject
      any further incoming energy or it must re-emit that energy as fast
      as it is received. Since there appears to be no mechanism to valve
      the incoming radiation I am inclined to the latter view that
      re-emission takes place, but this re-emission need not be (and
      probably is not) within the same spectral band as the incoming
      radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 11</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this respect, the action is similar
      to fluorescence, were light is re-emitted, but at a different
      frequency. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There are other examples. RF radiation
      striking matter causes an increase in temperature so that as the
      temperature rises, infrared is emitted and this increases until a
      balance --- input vs output --- is reached. All phosphors, in
      general, do the same thing. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p11.jpg" width="586" height="173"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming a constant primary, then </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">E<sub>pri</sub> = E<sub>sec</sub> + E<sub>elec</sub>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the electrical circuit is opened
      then </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">E<sub>pri</sub> = E<sub>sec</sub> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, it follows necessarily that all
      rocks must re-emit or re-radiate, especially if there is no
      conversion to electricity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If there is conversion to electricity
      and that electrical output is converted by Joule heating within
      the rock, then the rock becomes warmer than the ambient. This may
      be the reason for the Brush "spontaneous generation of heat in
      certain complex silicates, lavas and clays". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 12.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This means that a rock may have a
      second re-emission spectral band as heat: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p12.jpg" width="655" height="143"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would appear that the re-emission
      spectral band need not be the same as the primary --- depending
      upon the nature of the rock or the temperature of the rock. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In physics generally, except in the
      case of direct reflection, re-radiation, or fluorescence is
      seldom, if ever, of the same frequency as the incident primary
      radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I cannot conceive that rocks merely
      reflect the primary, hence, I believe the secondary is of a
      different frequency and this varies from rock to rock depending
      upon internal composition. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now the question of resonance comes
      up. Is there some internal characteristic of granitic rocks,
      perhaps a kind of resonance, which permits the rock to select its
      particular frequency from the broad band of incident primary
      frequencies? In other words, are rocks tuned like a radio receiver
      so that they respond only to a certain frequency? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Where conversion to electricity takes
      place, this would explain the difference in emf generated by
      different rocks at the same instant. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 13.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming that the primary for a
      certain rock is composed of the secondaries of adjacent rocks, and
      assuming that the certain rock referred to is resonant, then it
      follows that the receptor rock may be directly influenced by the
      secondary of an adjacent rock with which it is resonant. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p>.<img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p13a.jpg" width="550" height="165"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Therefore, the second rock, which is
      the sensor and is generating an emf, is subject not only to its
      own primary, but also t the secondary of an adjacent rock with
      which it resonates. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">So, in a system of rocks, an extremely
      complex interrelationship may exist, with all neighboring rocks
      contributing to the emf output of the sensor rock. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p13b.jpg" width="442" height="251"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 14.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this case, the resonant sensor rock
      would respond to the total flux of the secondaries of all the
      adjacent rocks, but particularly that portion of the total flux
      with which it is resonant. It would also respond to that portion
      of its own primary with which it is resonant. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the above examples, I have referred
      to adjacent rocks. How adjacent? Will a large mass like a granite
      mountain at a distance produce the same effect as a small granite
      rock close by? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">And what about other materials than
      granite? What about lava, or clay or ocean water? This thing goes
      wild --- it gets more and more complicated. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, if the crust of the Earth
      generates secondary emissions and it comes from near and far and
      it comes from granite, marble, clay, ocean water, hot magma and
      possibly even the core of the Earth itself, it is no wonder that
      the spectrum is so broad. And it is no wonder that various regions
      within that total spectrum continuously shift up and down
      according t the relative intensities of these various secondaries.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I begin to see where it is a most
      complex phenomenon. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 15.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Actually, one may say that the primary
      for any sensor is the complex blending of the secondaries of all
      masses of whatever nature anywhere within range. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the macrocosmos, one could then
      believe (for the same reason) that the secondaries of the stars,
      every star in the galaxy, bathes the Earth. One could say that the
      primary striking the Earth comes from the secondaries of every
      other body (material body) in the Universe. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">So far as the Earth is concerned, its
      primary is composed not only from the secondaries of the stars
      (near and far) but of all the planets, the moon and the sun! The
      Earth then, as its part, re-radiates so that its secondaries
      travel outward to the moon, the sun, all the planets and the
      stars. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All matter in the universe must
      therefore be tied together in a vast network of primaries and
      secondaries, of incoming and outgoing radiant energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">What is the nature of this radiant
      energy? Is it gravitational? Does it produce te force of gravity?
      Or is it something new, something which may never have been
      discovered or even postulated? Is it limited to the speed of light
      or is it (as Newton postulated) "action at a distance" with
      infinite velocity? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 16.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>184. A Communication System
          Using Secondary Radiation.</i></b><a name="184"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, Feb 11, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, p. 11, it was
      proposed that masses receive what is termed primary radiation from
      the ambient and, upon saturation, re-radiate secondary radiation.
      However, If electrical energy is generated in the process, and
      that energy is conducted away, the amount of re-radiation is
      reduced. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, the incoming energy
      must always equal the total outgoing energy, i.e., the electrical
      plus the secondary. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">E<sub>pri</sub> = E<sub>sec</sub> + E<sub>elec</sub>.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would appear, therefore, that if
      one varies the electrical output, the radiation (secondary) output
      would vary inversely. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If one modulated the electrical
      output, the secondary radiation (whatever it is), would be
      modulated with inverted phase. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p16.jpg" width="500" height="215"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 17.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the secondary radiation of one
      mass, which is being modulated, becomes (in part) the primary of
      another mass, then it would seem that the electrical output of the
      second mass would be accordingly modulated. Hence: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p17.jpg" width="618" height="257"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Therefore, it would appear that a
      communication system is possible, using secondary radiation as the
      transmitting agent. If that secondary radiation is gravitational
      in nature, it would be very penetrating --- passing readily thru
      electromagnetic shields. This then would be a way to test the
      communication possibilities as well as providing some clue as to
      the nature of secondary radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We might call this "rock
      communication" since rocks would constitute the antennae of both
      the transmitter and the receiver. If the emission frequency of the
      receiving rock and the receptive frequency of the receiving rock
      matched, the system would be tuned very much like a radio system.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>185. Geophysical Regions as
          Active Emitters</i></b><a name="185"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu; Feb 15, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As we continue to get more data from
      the various sensors, it begins to appear that the variations which
      occur, and show up in the charts, would be due to variations in
      the secondary radiation from land mass domains. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The whole idea that regions of the
      Earth’s crust emit some form of radiant energy is interesting, to
      say the least. This emission is not electromagnetic, so far as we
      know. Of course, there is heat radiation --- secondary radiation
      from the sun, then conceivably fluorescence (from certain minerals
      and rocks) as the secondary emission from sunlight. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The idea that there may be a type of
      re-emission or fluorescence from gravitational radiation from
      space is new. But I wonder if this may not be exactly what it is.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this is true, then the primary
      radiation from space account for the energy of excitation. Various
      regions (granite, lava, clay, perhaps sea water) respond
      differently according to their resonance and each region emits its
      own characteristic spectrum. The intensity of each varies from
      time to time for reasons which may become clearer as the research
      continues. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 19.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The various sensors are resonant also
      and respond to the terrestrial region with which they are most
      closely tuned. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It has been suggested in one of the
      previous sections (Sec. 173, p. 140) that moving a sensor around
      in the automobile that various regions might be mapped, perhaps
      even an isometric chart prepared: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p19.jpg" width="524" height="145"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this is possible, what does the
      chart represent? Obviously, regions of greater secondary emission.
      But what are some of the factors affecting the emission: moisture
      (the presence of water) or heat (possibly sub-surface
      temperature)? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Did the high readings over Kula
      represent high sub-surface temperature? If so, this may represent
      a valuable tool for locating geothermal reservoirs. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I shall conduct some surveys over the
      Koolau Dome area on Oahu. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Does this mean, if true, that the
      secondary emission of rock is a function of its temperature? Is
      this additional emission due to thermal energy conversion? Or does
      the heat act catalytically, making the rock (or region) more
      susceptible to the incoming primary, so as to derive more energy
      from it? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Either way, the additional secondary
      emission is indicative of heat. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Considering that virtually all our
      sensors here in Hawaii show a definite diurnal pattern --- low at
      6-7 AM and high at 6-8 PM, could this be ground temperature? It is
      easily proved that it is not air temperature. How deep in the
      ground could such changes in temperature occur? The lag from air
      temperature is quite understandable. Could the secular change be
      due to the variations in temperature of individual geothermal
      regions? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">What about rainfall? Does ground
      moisture play a part --- either as water content or by its cooling
      action? Obviously, deep layers of earth or rock do not change
      their moisture content rapidly. Something else must cause the
      sudden glitches. Could they be cosmic ray showers? Or some other
      unidentified energetic radiation? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In summary so far, it now appears
      highly probable that our sensors are responsive to the secondary
      emission of various regions of the ambient matter, rocks, sand,
      water, any dense mass. </p>

    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu; Feb 18, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If granitic rocks generate an emf
      depending upon temperature (either by direct thermoelectric
      conversion or by increased gravitoelectric susceptance) then what
      about lava rocks? Could the massive and dense (3.2 gr/cm<sup>3</sup>)
      material making up the Koolau Plug radiate (increased) secondary
      radiation because of its possible high temperature? Or is there a
      kind of Curie Point, above which such secondary emission is
      precluded? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming that the Plug is hot, as
      evidenced by its lack of magnetization, could there be an
      increased radiation coming from that region above the plug which
      is below the Curie Point? Only field tests will reveal the answer.
    </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p21.jpg" width="579" height="390"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 22</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One could argue, based on the sensor
      evidence so far, that there must be a gravitic "Curie Point". In
      other words, there must be a temperature (depending upon the
      nature of the rock) above which secondary (gravitic) emission is
      not possible. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Otherwise the entire thickness of the
      Earth’s crust would be radiating with such overall intensity that
      it would mask the individual surface domains which now appear so
      strongly. Even the deeper sections, even to the core, might be
      radiating unless precluded from doing so by some critical or
      cut-off temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Returning to the consideration of the
      Koolau Plug, if the temperature of the plug itself (connected to
      the deep magma below) is above the gravitic cut-off, then no
      radiation would come from the plug. However, if the rock between
      the crest of the hot plug --- extending clear to the surface, is
      below the cut-off, then it surely would be radiating. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, if all this is true, it
      represents a geophysical tool to explore warm spots too deep to be
      detected by infrared aerial surveys. By pinpointing the
      intermediate depth warm spots, one could predict regions of strong
      temperature gradients and, therefore, the existence of hot spots
      below. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 23.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Laboratory tests should be conducted
      of secondary emissivity with temperature. It isn’t enough to
      merely heat a rock sensor and to determine its emf output as a
      function of temperature. What we are talking about is gravitic
      emissivity from ambient rocks near te sensor rock. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p23.jpg" width="752" height="217"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the above consideration, I have
      speculated upon the effect of temperature upon the secondary
      emission of ambient rocks or domains. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">But domains (depending upon the type
      of material) --- granite, lava, clay, sand or possibly water ---
      differ in the characteristic spectrum of their secondary emission.
      It is possible that spectral signatures differ widely, so that one
      may eventually be able to identify the domain by its spectral
      signature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">But a change in temperature, or even
      moisture, could affect the signature, either to change the
      intensity or the spectrum, or both. No wonder the various sensors
      reveal a complex of independent variables, considering that each
      sensor responds to its tuned ambient domains near and far away. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 24.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These surely are not temperature
      related, but must come in to the various emitting domains from
      space as changes in the primary --- either as intensity changes or
      spectral shifts. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Some glitches affect all sensors
      simultaneously, or within a few minutes. It is possible that the
      ambient domains respond differently to the primary glitches from
      space, both as to resonant frequency shift and general intensity.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would appear, therefore, that while
      the sensor itself may be responsive to these "space" glitches, it
      is more reasonable to believe that the sensor mainly picks up the
      response (as secondary emission) of the ambient domains to said
      "space" glitches. The effect, therefore, may be one step removed.
    </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p24.jpg" width="498" height="311"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The same indirect effect may apply to
      the secular variations which may also come in from space. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 25.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">[Missing] </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 26.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In summary, therefore, it may be said
      that ambient domains, emitting secondary radiation are tuned and
      have characteristic spectral signatures which are picked up by a
      sensor similarly tuned. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Any sensor may pick up the combined
      radiation from a vast mosaic of domains of similar spectral
      characteristics. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">At this point, it is believed that the
      daily (solar-driven) variations in the domain temperature affect
      the sensor, not the temperature of the sensor itself. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The peaking temperature (phase) of the
      various masses comprising the domain are never precisely the same,
      but may vary over many hours --- hence, the difference in peaking
      time (or phase). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Proximity of the sensor to its
      (resonant) domain is important as the action is presumed to fall
      off as a function of distance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the case of the Koolau Plug,
      resonant in a certain spectral band, we may have to try different
      sensors in order to find one with the same (or close) spectral
      sensitivity. What would be different about the Koolau Plug, from
      the neighboring domains? Probably its density or its temperature.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Earth-currents have been observed and
      measured over vast regions of the earth’s surface for many years.
      Much of this early work was performed by the Carnegie Inst. during
      and prior to 1930 by O. Gish. Diurnal variations were consistently
      observed which seemed to be related to the Earth’s magnetic
      envelope. Observations also bore correlation with solar flares,
      magnetic storms and auroral displays. There is quite a literature
      on this subject. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Continuation of these earth current
      measurements in Hawaii showed the existence of self-potential
      domains, as: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These domains appeared to be related
      to (or caused by high subsurface temperatures, thus indicating the
      probable locations of geothermal reservoirs. No explanation, to my
      knowledge, has been advanced for the cause of this electrical
      potential. It has been thought to be caused by some (obscure)
      oxidation process. But one may ask: oxidation of what? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 28.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am of the opinion, at this moment,
      that these self-potential domains are of the same origin as the
      domains as discussed in Dec. 185, p. 18. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rocks within the domain must be
      generating higher emf than those in the surrounding area, hence an
      electrical gradient outward as shown in Fig. 1, p. 27. I
      understand that some of these self-potential gradients run as high
      as 900 mV. This is not incompatible with the emf produced by our
      individual rock sensors. It may simply mean that the rocks below
      the surface are hot and that their gravito-electric (if that is
      what it turns out to be) conversion of energy is greater. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I plan to take a portable EA recorder
      with a rock sensor in the automobile to the Koolau site this
      weekend, making continuous measurements in and about the area. It
      is entirely possible that a telluric domain can be pinpointed and
      profiled. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, it was
      pointed out that telluric electricity, so-called self-potential,
      appears to be generated in hot geothermal domains. The electrical

      gradient. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, it would seen that if we placed
      a large electrode in the center of the domain and other electrodes
      in the periphery, and substantial current might be observed,
      outward from the center. In other words, if we placed electrodes
      in regions of different temperature, currents would flow from the
      hot region to the cold region. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Which means that electrons must flow
      inward toward the hot region. But where is the return circuit? Let
      us worry about that later. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the meantime, one might generalize
      that the hot magma is positive, while the upper crust of the earth
      is negative. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 30.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Or, that the top of a drill hole (into
      a geothermal reservoir) is negative, while the bottom is positive.
      If large enough electrodes were embedded at each place, a
      commercially useful current may be obtained. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is interesting to consider at this
      point whether the electrical energy is entirely converted from
      thermal energy or whether gravito-electric conversion is partly
      responsible. As stated before, high temperature may increase the
      susceptance of rocks to gravitational radiation, so that more
      gravitic energy is captured. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A test might be to look for glitches
      or secular changes typical to primary space radiation. Purely
      thermal conversion would depend only on temperature differential
      and probably would be fairly constant. </p>

          Shielding.</i></b><a name="189"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, Mar. 3, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It has recently been noticed that when
      a shielded sensor (No. 16-GZZ-100) is removed from the vicinity
      (along side of) an unshielded (but Plexiglass encased) sensor No.
      17-DZZ-100 and 18-DZZ-1000, the two unshielded sensors increase
      emf output substantially. Obviously, they sense the presence of
      the metallic (aluminum) shielded sensor alongside. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Two reasons or this: (1) a depressing
      effect resulting from interfering resonance, or (2) the effect of
      the adjacent metal case. I am inclined to favor the latter
      explanation, as: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p31.jpg" width="593" height="254"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This could, of course, be the result
      of partial electromagnetic shielding --- provided by No. 1, if em
      radiation is causing the emf in No. 2 and 3. But em radiation
      cannot explain the diurnal and other sensor characteristics. So
      let us consider something radically different and perhaps not
      considered in contemporary physics. That is a kind of "ether"
      flow. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 32.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If a critical flow of ether existed
      (in this instance), it may find greater conductivity (or
      permeability) in the metal. Hence, it would be diverted away from
      the Plexiglass encased sensors. When the metal is removed, the
      flux would then increase in the two other sensors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This may throw an entirely new light
      on the entire phenomenon. Could it be related to ether or ether
      flow? And it presents a new possibility in the design of the
      resistor-type sensors, as follows: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p32.jpg" width="559" height="431"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 33.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This hypothesis can be rather easily
      tested by inserting a large diameter rod in the center of the
      ceramic tube which forms the substrate for the large resistor,
      such as the GZZ or DZZ series. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rods of both light and heavy metal
      should be tested, say aluminum and lead. If we are observing a
      kind of gravitational flux permeability, there should be a
      difference. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Just as magnetic flux follows an iron
      core, so possibly a gravitational flux follows a lead core. I
      wonder! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Magneto-electric/gravito-electric
      induction: Inductive windings generate an emf then the core is
      center. If a lead core is centered within a resistive winding,
      would it be a parallel situation? Would it represent
      gravito-electric induction? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;In looking back over the sensor
      records, I find an interesting fact: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p33.jpg" width="625" height="359"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 34.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This seems to indicate that any kind
      of case (on the outside) reduces the emf output. The effect is the
      same as if it were only the result of electromagnetic induction
      --- from ambient em noise --- but this does not seem to be borne
      out. It is not incompatible with an inductive hypothesis of
      another sort, perhaps gravito-electric. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another aspect of this finding and
      interpretation is that a sensor is influenced by the nature of its
      surroundings. In the apex, maximum readings may be expected. When
      surrounded by heavy walls or large metal objects, the readings
      would be less. I believe this was borne out at the Haleakala
      Observatory, where on one instance a sensor was attached to a
      steel column. Virtually no reading. Removed from the vicinity of
      the column, the reading became normal. Hence, one might say that
      steel framing (in a building) reduces the readings of the sensors.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence a sensor may serve as a detector
      of neighboring masses --- a proximity sensor if you will. The
      greater the density or mass the greater is the effect. But the
      mechanism of this effect is the action of the neighboring mass
      upon the ether flux (much as I hate to use that word --- nothing
      else quite fills the bill). </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p34.jpg" width="602" height="199"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 35.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Fig. 1, the flux lines are
      concentrated thru the sensor. In Fig. 2, the adjacent mass has
      "stolen" the field. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This brings up the possibility that
      certain "long form" sensors may be directional --- that is,
      respond when in the alignment of the flux. In the previous Figs 1
      and 2 the flux was assumed to be vertical. But what of a
      transverse or horizontal flux? Does flux density shift from
      predominately vertical to strongly horizontal and back again? Is
      this the mechanism of the diurnal variation? Now, we must carry on
      some careful orientation tests. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Are we possibly talking about ether
      drift? I am no sure that there is no ether drift. Certainly, the
      long labors of Miller have never been contradicted by valid
      experiment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming for the moment that ether
      drift does exist and that the movement o the Earth around the Sun,
      coupled with the axial rotation of the Earth gives rise to the
      diurnal variations which we consistently observe, could we place a
      long sensor on an equatorial mounting and continuously observe the
      direction of motion? I am inclined to think we could. </p>

          EMF Output.</i></b><a name="190"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, March 10, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It has long been observed, both in the
      emf output of rocks and resistor-diode combination hat continuous
      rapid variations exist. These variations have appeared to be
      mostly random, with a few instances where regular periods of
      several minutes to several hours have been observed. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A volcanic rock of about 10 cm
      diameter was picked up on the beach at Waikiki, oven-dried a 400
      F, then after cooling, copper-print electrodes were painted on (in
      the usual manner). Output was about 60 mV. But when connected to
      the EA recorder immediately showed a rapid regular pulsation of
      approx 1 second frequency. See Chart at left (1 sec marks). Also
      another frequency appeared of about 1/3 second pulse duration.
      Phase shifting complicated the pattern. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is the first time, to my
      knowledge, that rapid regular pulsations have been observed. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, the big question is, what is the
      source? Other rocks picked up the same day do not show this
      pattern. Hence, it is not in the recorder circuitry, but comes
      from the particular rock. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 18, it was suggested that by
      using cores of heavy material, the output of resistive sensors
      could be increased. Lead and aluminum rods, as cores within DZZ
      resistors, were suggested. This might give some clue as to the
      so-called gravitational permeability, or (if you will) ether flux.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An experiment has (this day) been
      conducted which may relate to the above. One of the recently
      acquired resistors (DZW-100 megaohm) was filled with beach sand
      from Kuhio Beach. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tested both before and after filling,
      revealed substantial gain in emf output with a sand core. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Could this mean increased grav.
      permeability or could it mean proximity to a re-emitting mass as
      discussed in Sec. 183? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 38.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This experiment raises the question as
      to the effect of other core materials: </p>

      sands. <br>

      (4) Lead monoxide (litharge). <br>
      (5) Lead monoxide and glycerine compound. <br>
      (6) White silica sand. <br>
      (7) Molding sand (with clay content) <br>
      (8) Carborundum or alundum. <br>
      (9) Powdered metals, lead, aluminum, etc. <br>
      (10) Iron filings. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Water, sea water. <br>
      (2) Alcohols. <br>
      (3) Carbon tetrachloride --- heavy non-conducting liquids. <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It appears to be quite definite, at
      least in the instance of the first test with Kuhio Beach sand)
      that the emf output increased from approx 63 mV to over 115 mV and
      still rising! There is no question that the sand core did increase
      the output of the sensor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, the next question is: Is this due
      to re-emission&nbsp; (secondary radiation) from the sand? If it
      has a frequency spectrum, is it related to the spectrum of the
      entire Kuhio Beach area? What is the diurnal pattern? Could it be
      affected by the temperature changes of the Kuhio Beach area? These
      are interesting and perhaps very important questions. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the answer can be related to the
      area from which the ore material is obtained, we may have an
      important geophysical sensing tool. Of course, the porcelain tube
      (substrate) of the resistor may have its own contribution and this
      must be taken into account. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By this same reasoning, a rock sensor
      may be related to the area from which the rock came. Granite rocks
      from granite areas. Lava rocks from specific volcanic areas. One
      wonders about liquid cores. Could a salt water core be related to
      the body of ocean water? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There is a growing belief that the
      so-called "events" observed by Joseph Weber in his gravitational
      radiation detectors are not due to oscillations of the large
      aluminum cylinders. The very nature of the electrical impulses
      from the strain gauges does not appear to resemble the kind of
      thing one would expect from a "ringing" cylinder. If shock
      excited, the cylinder would engage in decremental excitation, as:
    </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">at the resonant frequency --- 1661 Hz
      or 1580 Hz, as the case may be. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, the events indicated by
      resistance changes in the strain gauges do not show this
      decremental pattern, but something quite different. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It leads one to believe that the
      events are not indicative of cylinder oscillations but of some
      effect arising within, or related to the electrical circuit. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, one must look to resistive
      changes or to voltage "bursts" in the resistive materials. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 41.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This brings to mind that the effects
      observed and reported in the previous section (191) and in 189 may
      be responsible for the Weber events. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If resistive material lies adjacent to
      a large mass, is it possible that the secondary emission from the
      mass could affect the resistance? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the case of the sand core
      experiment, it seemed clear that the presence of the sand affected
      the output of the sensor. If the sand were replaced with a mass of
      metal, such as aluminum, would there be similar, or even greater,
      augmentation? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is precisely the arrangement in
      the Weber experiments. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A better arrangement might be to
      surround the mass with resistive material (preferably
      non-inductive). </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Or, using Weber-type cylinders, simply
      attach sheets of resistive material, of 100 megaohm or more, to
      the sides of the cylinder, just as the strain gauges are attached.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The only difference would be that
      large high-resistance non-inductive sheets are used instead of the
      comparatively low-resistance strain gauges. Then using also diodes
      for rectification of the RF induced in the sheets. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Other large masses may be used even
      more effectively. It need not be an expensively machined cylinder.
      Any large hunk of material would serve as an emitter. Perhaps,
      even a mountain. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is all based on the belief, at this
      point, that radiation from space (gravitational or something else)
      is the primary --- supplying energy, and that the mass engages in
      fluorescence, emitting a secondary which generates RF noise in
      neighboring resistive material. The spectral band of the secondary
      may be quite different from that of the primary, depending upon
      the composition of the re-emitting material and its temperature. </p>

          Rocks.</i></b><a name="193"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, Mar. 24, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rock sensors act as storage batteries
      and may be charged. Just how long the charge remains varies with
      the particular rock. Rocks in series are able to store a higher
      voltage. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, rocks have a very high
      (natural) capacitance. More than capacitance, it seems to be in
      the nature of a persisting excitation. So long as the excitation
      persists, the voltage sustains. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thus, it is not simple capacitance
      depending upon the dielectric constant of the dielectric but
      something else, a form of excitation which requires an energy
      input and then decays. This decay is far slower than if the effect
      were merely capacitance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This difference (from ordinary
      condenser action) is clearly noted when the rock is shorted. When
      the short is removed the potential returns to a value almost as
      great as before the short occurred. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 44.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this respect it is similar to
      electrets which may be shorted and then return to normal when the
      short is removed. Hence, we may again refer to rocks as
      geo-electrets (Sec. 172). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There is this difference. Carnauba wax
      electrets retain a high voltage but can support virtually no
      current. Geo-electrets seem to be able to support large currents,
      depending upon the size. Large rocks may conceivably provide
      substantial current. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This places the geo-electret in the
      class of a chemical cell or storage batter, and may, as a matter
      of speculation, find an application commercially as an energy
      storage means. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One may picture large blocks of
      granite, connected in series, as equivalent to storage batteries
      --- with the advantage of not requiring service or replacement and
      conceivably having indefinite, unlimited life. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 46.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This then becomes a radially polarized
      electrical domain. Measurements of the so-called self-potential of
      this region would establish the existence of such a domain. Can
      this pinpoint the presence of subsurface heat? Apparently, it is
      believed that it can. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This would infer that the hottest
      region is positive and that the heat gradient and electric
      gradient are parallel. Hence, in the case of the Koolau Plug, the
      central region of the plug is positive while the periphery is
      negative. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This charge retention in rocks,
      perhaps also in many solids (crystalline and amorphous), may be
      due to dipole orientation. A gradient or field probably aligns the
      constituent dipoles, so that a net potential difference results.
      The greater the number of aligned dipoles, the greater is the net
      potential. But the alignment decays, as individual dipoles flip to
      random positions. Hence, the net voltage drops. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thermal agitation would appear to
      hasten this decay. Hence, the higher the temperature the more
      rapid the decay. At some temperature (as with the Curie Point in
      magnetism) dipole orientation cannot be maintained and the net
      charge would disappear. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 47.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Conversely, at lower (cryogenic)
      temperatures, the net charge may possibly be retained
      indefinitely. This, I believe, is true with electrets generally,
      although certain electret waxes (of very high resistivity)
      maintain charge for long periods of time. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Going forward with this thinking, one
      might say that the (natural) residual charge of a rock may be
      wiped out by heating to a certain temperature which we shall call
      the Electrical Curie Point. Then apply a high electric gradient to
      the rock as it is cooling, possibly to some cryogenic temperature
      where the charge persists without decaying. The stored energy
      would have come from the applied field. Could it be removed by
      shorting or an electrical load? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Or would there be a replenishment of
      that charge thru the mechanism of primary and secondary radiation,
      as discussed in the earlier sections? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Is it possible that a newly-acquired
      rock sensor must be polarized to be sensitive to the incident
      radiation? Does the degree of polarization affect the spectral
      band to which the rock responds? Can one change the circadian
      signature of a sensor by applying a field or gradient? This may be
      possible with rocks but why would it be effective with the
      so-called synthetic rocks --- resistor, diode, capacitor sensors
      where dipole orientation seems inappropriate. </p>

          Polarization.</i></b><a name="194"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 1, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is believed that the storage of
      electricity in rocks is the result of polarization, i.e., the
      alignment of electric dipoles within the body of the rock. When a
      field is applied, the dipoles are aligned and this energy is
      retained by that alignment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As the alignment decays, the charge
      decays also. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Initial alignment may result from
      atmospheric gradient, as suggested in Fig. 3, p. 45. This may
      account for the seemingly valid observation that the upper side of
      rocks (such as those picked up on the beach) are positive. This
      may also be accounted for as gravito-electric induction. Perhaps
      even the atmospheric gradient is the result of gravito-electric
      induction. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Recent tests, where a field is applied
      to initially polarize a rock show a phenomenal reversal of initial
      polarity. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Volumes of sand, in insulated
      containers, act as rocks. This is probably to be expected. Sand
      grains in contact with each other actually form a series of
      dipoles. </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Here, too, the original polarizing
      charge decays and reverses, as in Fig. 1. Variations, diurnal and
      secular, occur then in the reversed charge. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is believed many granular or
      powdered materials behave in this way. Tests are proposed with
      litharge, silica sand, monazite, black lava sand, barium titanate
      powder, clays, coral sand, etc. Is it a function of mass and/or
      dielectric constant? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 2, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 144, Notebook 3, dated 2-7-74,
      reference is made to the interaction of the gravitational and
      electric fields. It was pointed out that the atmospheric electric
      field, the mountain effect, and similar vertically-oriented
      electric fields may be caused by the gravitational field of the
      Earth. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This reference goes on to suggest a
      possible gravity-vector instrument useful in space navigation. It
      describes such an instrument in Fig. 4 (p. 66), based on the
      belief that the upper end o a vertical resistor is positive with
      respect to the lower end. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 170 (pp 133 and 134), the
      electrical polarization (possibly by the gravity flux) was
      extended to include rocks and grains of sand. Gravito-electric
      induction was again proposed in Sec. 171 (9-14-74). Improved
      sensors for gravity-flux were described (p. 139, Fig. 1) where
      beach sands, or loess, would be settled in a fluid. During
      settling, the individual sand grains would have an opportunity to
      orient before compacting. Hence, a permanent geo-electret would be
      formed. Such a sensor was illustrated in Fig. 1, p. 139. In every
      case, it is believed that the positive end of the sensor will be
      up, and negative down. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 51.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In an experiment performed today,
      Kuhio Beach sand was paced in a Plexiglas tube with electrodes at
      each end, as: </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Immediately, the upper electrode
      became positive. Voltage approx 60 mV. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When the tube was inverted, the upper
      end again became positive, at about the same potential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, it again pointed up the
      relation of electrical polarity wit the gravity vector. It is a
      difficult phenomenon to explain in terms of contemporary physics.
      To my knowledge no known electrical manifestation is related to
      gravity with the possible exception of the orientation of polar
      molecules in florigen/heterauxin which seems to be responsible for
      the vertical growth of plants. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, the next question arise: what of
      centrifugal fluids? Is the effect, as in Fig. 1, responsive to
      inertial fields? Is there equivalence between inertial and
      gravitational mass, or is somehow an exception? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 52.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Only future tests will reveal the
      answer. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Today, most of the recording
      equipment, including the digital data logger was moved to the
      basement, constant temperature seismic vault of the Hawaii Inst.
      of Geophysics. Recording was started at 1600. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The vertical sensor is still at my
      apartment in Waikiki. I shall move it to the University tomorrow.
      I plan to place it on a trunnion mounting, so as to invert it

      read voltage and polarity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the above experiments, it is
      important to electrically shield the Plexiglas tube from
      electrostatic gradients in the ambient. Ideally, the tube should
      be placed within a grounded metal case which is attached to the
      trunnion support. Shielded cables must be used also. Observations
      should be made as to whether the maximum voltages occur in the
      zenith-nadir alignment (as it should be if it truly gravity flux)
      or whether, if mounted equatorially, it might indicate some
      contribution by a cosmic field. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 3, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, vertical
      dipole induction from the gravity gradient was discussed.
      Crystalline materials, such as rocks or grains of sand, were
      considered. It was discovered that the sand sensors were superior
      to rock sensors for detecting the gravity vector. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The mechanism is not clearly
      understood at this point, but it is believed that dipole rotation
      may be responsible. Sand is better than crystalline rock possibly
      because the resident electric dipoles may rotate more freely. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is now suggested that amorphous
      materials and fluids, especially liquids, which have high
      resistivity, density and dielectric constant, may be better than
      sand. An insulated tube filled, let us say, with carbon
      tetrachloride or bromine or acetylene tetrabromide may allow rapid
      orientation of resident dipoles. Since high resistivity appears to
      be required, liquids with ionic conduction would not be suitable.
      Liquids with suspended powders may also be suitable. Matching the
      density of the liquid to the powder would help to keep the powder
      in suspension. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 13, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Various circuits have been tried, with
      more or less success, putting sensors in series order to build
      higher voltages. Strange effects occur which make the results
      disappointing. After a time, some of the sensors go negative
      (reverse their polarity) so that the total voltage is not
      sustained. This seems to occur not only with
      resistor-diode-capacitor sensors but also with rock sensors in
      series. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The reason for "going negative" when
      related in a circuit with other sensors is certainly not clear. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A slightly different circuit is
      suggested: </p>

          Temperature.</i></b><a name="199"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 15, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For some time, there has been
      conflicting evidence as to the effect of temperature, not only
      upon the resistor-diode-capacitor sensors, but also upon the rock
      and piezoelectric types. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There appears to be some complex
      temperature dependence upon the sensor itself, but there are
      instances where the actual sensor temperature is constant and the
      (remote) ambient temperature changes --- producing a change in
      output. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, a sensor might
      indicate a temperature change of a remote medium and yet (itself)
      remain at a constant temperature. The "remote" medium may be air,
      or, conceivably, it could be masses of rock, sand, or water. It
      could be termed a remote-sensing pyrometer, almost like an optical
      pyrometer except that no part of the pickup changes temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This may turn out to be a phenomenon
      related to secondary radiation (see. p. 23). If the neighboring
      radiating mass is warmed, it could radiate more (scalar increase)
      or it could increase the radiation frequency. This could be
      entirely a remote-activated effect. The sensor itself need not
      change temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 56.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There have been several striking
      instances which point to this conclusion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Sensors operating in constant
      temp. conditions (cabinets) sense the temp. variations of the
      environment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) Sensors in boxes of large thermal
      inertia sense rapid changes in the ambient temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) The entire phenomenon of diurnal
      variations, where sensors are heat-shielded. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Air (atmospheric) probably has the
      greatest (diurnal) effect, although soil, sand or surface rocks
      may contribute to a daily temperature effect with different
      phasing. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Could this explain the various diurnal
      pattern (circadian cycles) which are observed? </p>

          Materials as Sensors.</i></b><a name="200"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Almost from the beginning of this
      research, as early as 1927 at Janesville OH, massive high-K
      dielectrics have been used. At the naval Research Lab (1931-33),
      the assigned official project was "The Anomalous Behavior of
      Massive High-K Dielectrics". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Various massive high-resistance
      materials were tested. At Janesville, powdered lead monoxide
      (litharge) was mixed with molten paraffin (or beeswax) and cast
      into blocks with electrodes cast on opposite sides. These were
      called "molecular gravitators". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When these blocks were free to move,
      either as a pendulum or on a rotary support, and charged to
      150-300 KV DC, a mechanical force developed which moved the block
      in the direction neg to pos. The force varied with time even
      though the applied emf was held constant. This force appeared to
      have solar, lunar, and sidereal periodicities which was
      subsequently studied (over the years) in great detail. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Other materials such as lead monoxide
      and glycerine (chemically reacted), marble, lead monoxide in
      bakelite binder, were tried with varying success. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 58.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In later years, when high-K
      dielectrics as used in ceramic capacitor, were developed,
      attention was directed toward barium titanate and the like. As
      piezoelectric technology developed, other suitable materials came
      into being. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Today, various piezoelectric products
      such as those put out by Clevite Corp. (Cleveland) are on the
      market. Most of these materials are truly massive high-K
      dielectrics. Great progress has been made in the last 40 years,
      since the time of the project at NRL. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These new piezoelectric materials are
      "clay-like" substances which are molded like potters clay and
      fired. During the firing, a high voltage field (DC) is applied
      which aligns the natural dipoles and provides a (more or less)
      permanent polarization, thus making an "electret" capable of
      retaining a potential difference for a long period of time. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such an electret, like the earlier
      classic electrets of carnauba wax, will not support an electrical
      load. The voltage drops to zero, but recovers again when the load
      is removed. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Polarized piezoelectric transducers
      are used in submarine signal applications, sonar, etc.
      Polarization is needed for in-phase coupling. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 59.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The literature on the subject is
      extensive, but there is still some uncertainty as to the factors
      which affect the behavior of piezoelectric materials. In the
      following paragraphs, I shall point out some interesting
      observations which may (or may not) be related to gravitational
      radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) In the first place, these
      materials are truly massive high-K dielectrics. Barium titanate is
      one of the heaviest. Its dielectric constant, in some cases, is
      over 20,000! And it has very high electrical resistivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) The polarization life is quite
      long, and for practical purposes virtually steady. Minimum decay.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) It is an ideal material for
      intercepting gravitational radiation over a broad band, converting
      the energy of the gravitational radiation into an emf. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(4) Each constituent dipole acts as a
      gravito-electric converter, resulting in an increase in dipole
      gradient and total charge. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(5) The total charge of each dipole is
      additive along the alignment of dipoles so that total polarization
      (emf) is increased by the incident gravitic radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(6) Hence, there is a certain seeming
      parallel between piezo-electricity and gravito-electricity. The
      reasoning is this: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 60.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) In a photocell, incident light (em
      radiation) falls on a surface of material which emits electrons
      (classic photoelectric effect). The electrons are driven
      (energetically) to a collector electrode nearby. The collector
      becomes negative whereas the emitting surface becomes positive.
      Here is then an electric gradient, a polarization, or, if you
      prefer, an increased polarization. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) In a gravitocell, gravitic
      radiation penetrates thoughout the volume of a polar material,
      causing one of the constituent poles to emit electrons which are
      energetically driven to the other pole, leaving the first pole
      positive and making the second pole more negative, thus increasing
      the polarization or total emf. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) It must be borne in mind that the
      photoelectric effect is essentially a surface effect --- being the
      surface exposed to the incident light. Electrons are ejected from
      various distances below the surface, governed by the light
      absorption constant of the material, possibly from the Fermi
      level. The displaced electron (caused by photon absorption)
      travels through the crystal lattice to the surface. This travel to
      the surface requires energy and is called the work function. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 61.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(d) There is a distinct relation
      between the frequency of the light and the generated emf.
      Einstein’s equation is h ( v – v<sub>o</sub> ) = eV where h =
      Planck’s constant and v the frequency. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(e) The action of a gravitic quantum
      or graviton is similar to that of the photon. The action, however,
      occurs not just on the surface or near the surface, but throughout
      the volume of susceptable material. It may be termed ponderomotive
      in that it acts throughout the volume or mass of material. Rock
      sensors are examples. The electrical energy is generated
      throughout the entire volume of the rock, not just on the surface.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(f) High density of the receptor
      material appears to be a factor. The greater the mass, the higher
      is the graviton capture rate. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(g) High dielectric constant (high-K)
      may serve several functions: (1) to slow up the incident graviton
      so as to facilitate capture; (2) to concentrate the generated emf,
      or, (3) to store energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(h) In the case of a barium titanate
      sensor, it seems reasonable to assume that the heavier part (Ba)
      is the electron emitter and therefore positive. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 62.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The receptor would be the titanate
      half and the negative side of the dipole molecule. As in the case
      of a photocell, escape energy from the barium atom may be required
      so that work function would again apply. Alloys with cesium might
      lower that work function, or, as is the case with certain
      semi-conductors, intermetallic compounds such as Cs3Sb or
      Na-K-Cs-Sb, or other impurity states could lower the work
      function. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This may account for the observation
      that certain rocks, for example, granitic or lava rocks produce
      higher outputs. Impurities may be desirable. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) Since electromagnetic and gravitic
      radiation are closely related, the energy is directly related to
      frequency (hv = eV). Hence, the higher frequency bands of the
      gravitational wave spectrum are the more energetic, and probably
      have the greater effect on the sensors. Frequencies equal to those
      of light (especially blue and above) may be the most effective.
      Possibly gravitic frequencies may extend to those of x-rays or
      gamma rays. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(j) There is a theory that
      electromagnetic radiation from a dense star, passing through a
      fixed magnetic or electric field (surrounding the star or in the
      path of travel) will be slowly (gradually) converted into gravitic
      radiation. Hence, gravitic radiation, of the same frequency as
      light, may be present. One could thing of red, yellow, green, blue
      or violet gravitic radiation, with wavelengths expressed in
      Angstrom units (8000 to 4000A) as may be the case. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 63.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There would seem to be the possibility
      that monochromatic lines exist or other typical spectral
      configurations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(k) If such conversion actually takes
      place, i.e., from em to gravitational (at the same frequency), the
      residual light (not fully converted) must have lower energy than
      it did at the start --- hence, appear shifted to the red. Could
      this account for the cosmological red shift or the as yet
      unexplained redshift of certain stars or clusters? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(l) If this conversion is true, the
      total gravitic radiation in the band from 4000-8000 A must be
      great. Could it equal or exceed that of light? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(m) Hence, rock electricity from
      cosmic gravitic radiation may be homologous with photoelectricity
      from starlight or sunlight. Gravitoelectric and photoelectric
      conversions are parallel and the instrumentalities are similar.
      Both emit electrons (which are captures) by gravitons in one
      instance, photons in the other. Both convert energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(n) The term "white" gravitic
      radiation may have real significance, as a cosmic energy flux. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 64.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Summary:</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This section sets forth the
      parallelism of gravitic and em radiation throughout the entire
      spectral range. The hypothesis suggests the existence of gravitic
      radiation of the same frequency as light, extending possibly to
      x-rays or gamma rays. The lower end of the spectrum, the RF and
      sub-RF, has already been suggested by Press and Thorne. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Methods of detection are believed to
      be similar. Gravitons cause emissions of electrons from emissive
      materials, just as photons do. The gravitoelectric effect
      parallels the photoelectric effect. The gravitocell is similar to
      the photocell. Both are energy converters. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The gravitocell is volume dependent
      while the photocell is surface dependent. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Many natural materials are
      gravitocells, such as granitic rocks or siliceous sands, lavas, or
      clays. Polarization is important, so as to direct electron
      emission, Otherwise, emission is random and no net field or
      current can be generated. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a gravitocell, electron emission is
      facilitated by heating, hence it is somewhat temperature dependent
      up to its Curie Point. Impurities (certain semiconductors) may
      reduce the work unction, causing increased eV. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 65</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Piezoelectric materials with high
      polarization appear to be desirable because of the "field" needed
      to direct the electron emission. This field is internal. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Polarization aligns the dipoles within
      the gravitocell. During electron emission each dipole increases
      its potential difference, and since the dipoles (aligned) are in
      electrical series, the net emf of the series increases. Electrodes
      are at the ends of the series of internal dipoles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A reverse action may also take place
      during electron emission. Since the emitted electrons fall through
      the fixed field, the positive pole attracts the electrons, tending
      thereby to reduce the fixed field. This could cause, and does
      appear to cause, polarity reversal in the output. Very strong
      polarization is suggested to prevent such reversal. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Electron emission may conceivably be
      directed or influenced by a magnetic field. Direction would be at
      right angles to the field. This will be the subject of a further
      section. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>201. Quasi-Luminous Gravitic
          Radiation.</i></b><a name="201"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, Apr. 19, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is an extension of the hypothesis
      developed in the previous section. It concerns the idea that the
      broad spectrum of natural gravitational radiation extends beyond
      the range considered by Press and Thorne (p. 342, <i>Gravitational











        Wave Astronomy</i>). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These authors consider the spectral
      region from ELF to VHF. The concept presented here concerns the
      extension into quasi-luminous regions expressed in Angstrom Units,
      i.e., 8000 to 4000 A. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One reason for this belief is that
      theory exists in the literature today that em radiation (including
      light from stars) may be gradually converted into gravitational
      radiation (of the same frequency) while passing through static
      electric and/or magnetic fields which exist around certain stars
      or in galactic space. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such conversion must generate (if it
      exists) substantial amounts of quasi-luminous gravitic radiation
      throughout space. Our eyes cannot see it for the reason that our
      photosensitive receptors do not capture it. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is interesting to note that such
      conversion of the visible light from certain stars to gravitic
      radiation reduces the energy of the residual visible light,
      causing a redshift of that residual light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 67.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Is it possible that the anomalous
      redshift, observed in the light from certain star clusters, is not
      due to Doppler recession (as previously generally supposed) but to
      the energy depletion resulting from this conversion? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It may point up the existence of a
      substantial flux of quasi-luminous gravitic radiation throughout
      all cosmic space. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such radiation would have enormous
      penetrability, whereas light does not. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This penetrability permits gravitic
      "light" to penetrate throughout large volumes of heavy masses. If
      the method comprising such masses is electron-emissive through
      graviton capture --- just as photosensitive material is
      electron-emissive through photon capture --- a flux of free
      electrons is created. If a field exists to direct a flow of these
      free electrons, an electric current is created. This electrical
      energy is derived entirely from the incident gravitic light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The so-called "rock electricity" may
      result from such an energy conversion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since the eV so derived is a direct
      function of frequency, and rocks may vary in functional resonance,
      various rock specimens may be responsive to various spectral bands
      and output phasing (in their circadian rhythms) may be quite
      individual. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 68.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, certain rocks may be
      "green" sensitive, certain others "red" sensitive. And the
      incident radiation may vary as to green-red balance. The broad
      background radiation may be termed as white, but it could become
      reddened or blued in irregular (secular) or diurnal patterns. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Photocells (solar cells) convert light
      (visible and IR) from the sun. This is a practical source of
      electrical energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Gravitocells convert gravitic light
      into electrical energy, but the source is galactic, not just the
      sun. It is possible the sun may contribute to the total flux. This
      possibility requires further study. The thought here, however, is
      that this represents a new and untapped practical source of
      electrical energy if true. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The structure of photocells is
      technically fairly well understood. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The structure of gravitocells may be
      closely parallel. It is because of this parallelism that theory
      and practical development may "hang its hat". </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If quasi-luminous gravitic radiation
      is a valid concept and if the flux density at the Earth is
      adequate, it could represent an alternate source of much-needed
      energy of practical proportions. </p>

          Gravitocell.</i></b><a name="202"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honnolulu, Apr. 19, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Gravito-sensitive materials bear the
      same relationship to gravitic light as photosensitive materials
      bear to ordinary light. Both are fundamentally electron-emissive.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The photoelectric effect is primarily
      a surface effect (or a variable short distance under the surface).
      Incident photons penetrate to the conductor band relatively close
      to the Fermi level within the atom. In semi-conductors,
      penetration is largely to the valence band. Electrons are emitted
      (dislodged by the photon) which migrate through the lattice to the
      material surface. There they may be captured by an electrode
      which, thereupon, becomes negatively charged. A current can be
      generated between the main body of emissive material and this
      electrode. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In photoconductivity, the action is
      similar. Free additional carriers (mostly electrons) are generated
      when photon energies are absorbed in electronic transitions.
      Electrons are excited from a filled (atomic) band to a conduction
      band. Electron holes are injected into the valance band. At
      thermal equilibrium, photoconductivity depends on the energy of
      the incident photons. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 70.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In both photoelectric and
      photoconductive phenomena, photons kick electrons loose. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In gravitoelectric phenomena,
      gravitons also kick electrons loose, but the penetrability of
      gravitons permits the increase of free electron flux throughout
      the mass of the conductive (or semiconductive) material which
      absorbs the gravitons. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Gravitic radiation (let us now think
      of it as principally gravitic light) is highly energetic but
      almost perfectly penetrating. It has been said that such radiation
      is as penetrating as neutrinos! Nevertheless, it is almost
      perfectly penetrating, not perfectly penetrating. Mass (high
      density materials) keep it from being perfectly penetrating.
      Absorption is a function of mass. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Heavy materials would, it would
      appear, capture an unknown small portion of the ambient graviton
      flux, but the energy represented by that small portion may be
      substantial. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Predicated, therefore, on this
      possibility, graviton capture is assumed. Gravitons (sub-quanta)
      with energy of gravitic light may be extremely energetic. Their
      absorption is believed to be capable of electron emission or
      electron-hole formation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The thrust of all this is that
      electrical conduction (generally) may be affected. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 71.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This may be termed gravitoelectric
      conduction or gravitoelectric conductivity. It would be parallel
      to photoconductivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All conductors would be subject to
      this phenomenon, which would be observed as a change in
      resistance. It would appear that the more massive conductors would
      be the more vulnerable. The drop in resistance (caused by graviton
      capture) would be a function of mass. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, this may not be strictly true
      and might depend on electron hole recombination rates and other
      factors not related to mass. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The simplest form of gravitoelectric
      sensor may be a length of wire which is carrying a current. See
      Sec. 123, Notebk # 3 (1973. Effects would be observed as a change
      in resistance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Any semiconductor may show the same
      effect. Biased high resistance conductors seem to show an
      additional effect by acting as an electromotance, i.e., generation
      of a current. In such a device, the energy of the absorbed
      gravitons is converted into electrical energy in almost the same
      way as photons convert into electrical energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 72.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the ambient flux of gravitons
      changes the population of electron hole pairs within a conductor
      and the net movement of the charge carriers is directed, a usable
      current is generated. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Charge carriers may be directed by (1)
      An electric gradient (bias); (2) A magnetic field; (3) A gravity
      field (such as the Earth’s gravity field). </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Fig. 1, polarization is supplied by
      an HV external battery. Graviton-induced emf is counter to this
      polarization if electrostatically induced. If current-induced, it
      is augmentative. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Fig. 2, polarization is built into
      the emissive material. An electrostatic field is established
      within the mass. Graviton-induced charge carriers tend to migrate
      in the direction of the field, tending to reduce the field, thus
      decreasing the polarization. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Fig. 3, the alternating magnetic
      flux drives the graviton-induced charge carriers (as well as the
      free resident carriers) so as to increase output current. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a new type of sensor. Its
      output is AC. If RF driven (without core), the output would be
      augmented RF. </p>

          Bias.</i></b><a name="203"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 21, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, it was
      proposed that additional charge carriers (pairs) are created in
      massive dielectrics by the absorption of gravitons, an effect
      similar to pair creation in photoemissive materials by photons. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The difference lies in the difference
      in penetrability of gravitons and photons. Gravitons easily
      penetrate thru the massive material, whereas photons penetrate
      only a short distance below the surface. In the case of
      photoelectric emission of electrons, the electrons lose energy in
      escaping thru the crystal lattice (work function). In
      photoconductivity, it is the change in conductivity which results,
      rather than the emission of electrons. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The effect of gravitons is presumed to
      be on conductivity primarily. Electron hole pairs are created
      throughout the body of dense dielectric material. Recombination
      takes place rapidly unless a field (or current flow) exists. In
      such case, the additional charge carriers increase the
      conductivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would appear that a relationship
      exists between the current and the conductivity, i.e., the greater
      the current&nbsp; (or bias, the greater the conductivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 75.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These would be less time for
      recombination, or at least the rate would be lower. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In summary therefore, gravitocells
      should be biased, either by a current flow or by an electrostatic
      field (electric polarization) or em induction. </p>

      current. <br>

      Fig. 3, electromagnetic induction. <br>
      Fig. 4, high-freq. induction. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is recalled that the first gravitic
      sensors were believed to be operative because of a change in
      resistance. Resistance bridges were used, having arms of resistive
      material of different density. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Later, resistors (&gt;100 megaohms)
      were used, together with a diode. It is now seen that the diode
      (once AC was intercepted) provided the flow and the bias, which
      was then augmented. The establishment of the bias in rocks is not
      as yet understood. Once established, however, it could be
      sustained. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">But the purpose of this section is to
      point up the need, even with rock sensors, to use a battery to
      provide a reliable constant voltage bias. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 76.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An experiment is in progress today
      which, I believe, adds weight to this thinking. As follows: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p76.jpg" width="628" height="228"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The circuit actually measures the
      conductivity of the rock, but it provides the rock with a bias.
      Graviton-created charge carriers (electrons and holes) add to the
      normal conductivity. Variations in gravitic flux are readily
      observed as a change in conductivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is noted that conductivity
      increases at noon each day, hence it is an indication that the
      flux increases at noon. It does not appear to be temperature
      dependent. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Does this mean that the sun is a
      source of gravitic light as well as em light? What of gravitic
      heat --- slightly lower frequency? If this is so, would it
      represent an alternate source of energy? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 2, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, the biasing
      of rock sensors was discussed. It appears that the sensitivity
      (receptivity) or rock sensors to gravitic radiation is increased
      as some function of bias voltage. In an experiment currently
      underway a 45 V "B" battery is used. Diurnal sensitivity appeared
      to increase 10-fold over that of the normal which resulted from
      the rock’s natural self-potential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The thought, therefore, extends to the
      use of higher voltages. What would be the result? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">With the setup as shown in Fig. 1 (p.
      76), voltage across the rock ranges from 35.0 V at noon to 36.0 V
      during the night. Incoming radiation appears to reduce the rock
      bias, by lowering the resistance of the rock. This voltage
      variation is not steadily or smoothly changing; it is highly
      erratic, possibly noisy. Extraction of energy may be possible by
      rectifying this noise, as: </p>

      Perhaps the coupling transformer should be RF along with the
      amplifier. Will the voltage output of the RF transformer represent
      the incident gravitic radiation? Can it be recorded on a
      strip-chart recorder? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If resistors (100 megaohm or above)
      are substituted for the rock and constant voltage HV supply
      (possibly 10 to 25 KV) are used with the circuit described in Fig.
      2, "resistor" noise may be studied. Will this be the same kind of
      white noise ordinarily observed as resistor noise (Johnson or
      Nyquist)? Will there be any evidence that the cause if of cosmic
      origin? </p>

          Sensitivity.</i></b><a name="205"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 25, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">At the very start of these observation
      on resistive changes (Record Bk. 2), it was believed that a
      resistance differential effect would be observed between
      conductors of high mass vs low mass, i.e., tungsten vs aluminum.
      Resistance bridges were proposed. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the tests which followed, many
      bridge sensors were built. All showed positive results but were
      somewhat erratic. Low voltages &lt;6V were used. Now it appears
      very much higher voltages should have been used. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Matching rocks against standard
      resistors, the following circuit is suggested: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mass differential is provided between
      the rocks (or barium titanate blocks) and standard resistors which
      match in resistance. Adjust to null. It is thought that graviton
      flux increase will increase the conductivity of the
      electrically-stressed rocks creating a shift in the null. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 80.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Audible variations would be observed
      by placing an amplifier pickup in the circuit in place of the

      <p><b><i>Qualight and Qualitics</i></b></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 201, p. 66, the idea that the
      spectrum of natural gravitational radiation from space may extend
      into optical frequencies was presented. This broad natural
      spectrum, rather than stopping at microwave frequencies (as
      suggested by Press and Thorne) may conceivably extend upward into
      thermal and optical frequencies, possibly even to x-rays and gamma
      rays. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thus, the gravitic spectrum would
      parallel the electromagnetic spectrum. One would be the homologue
      of the other in all respects, except penetrability. Many of the
      properties of light may also be found in so-called quasi-light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, to assist in this concept,
      certain terms have to be invented. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Qualight" would be defined as
      quasi-light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"Qualitics", the homologue of optics.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 81.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><i>206. Qualitic Astronomy</i></b><a name="206"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, added to optical astronomy, radio
      astronomy and gravitational astronomy is a newcomer. While
      qualitic astronomy is related to basic gravitational astronomy, it
      is (or would appear to be) a discipline unto itself. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The whole idea of qualight is new, so
      far as I am aware. Qualitic radiation from the stars, with its
      many parallels to light, should be a new and separate regime. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Origin of Qualight</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is conceived that qualight is
      created by the conversion of light into gravitational radiation.
      Such conversion is believed to take place (gradually) as light
      traverses fixed electric and/or magnetic fields, such as those
      which surround certain dense stars or clusters or exist (for
      instance) even in the galaxies or in inter-galactic space. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This gradual conversion results in
      reddening of the residual light, and possibly explains the
      redshift with distance and the anomalous redshift observed in
      certain dense and active clusters nearby. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Integrated throughout space, the total
      energy of this converted light, as a presently existing flux, must
      be enormous, equaling or possibly exceeding the light flux. In
      other words, the total flux of qualight may equal (or exceed) the
      total flux of light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Qualight has one distinguishing
      property --- its penetrability. But it cannot be perfectly
      penetrating. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is reasonable to assume that
      absorption is a direct function of mass. Hence, heavy materials
      would absorb some of the qualight energy. Heavy metals (gold,
      tungsten, and the light) would appear to be principal candidates.
      But heavy dielectric materials (of high-K) may also absorb
      qualight. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Evidence of this absorption is the
      principal point of concern here. Energy is converted during
      absorption, possibly in most instances, into electricity or em
      radiation, being the reverse of the process by which qualight was
      created in the first place. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, throughout the universe, there
      may be energy exchange --- em into gravitic radiation and back
      again into em radiation ending in heat. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 83.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, light is converted
      into qualight which, through a process similar to
      photoconductivity, creates pairs of charge carriers (electrons and
      holes) which recombine with the evolution of heat. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another point of significance is that,
      if an electric or magnetic field exists in the material where
      charge carriers are created, so as to prevent immediate
      recombination, an electric gradient is generated which not only is
      measurable but may be useful. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In metals, because of high electrical
      conductivity, electric gradients are low and difficult to observe.
      In dielectrics, however, electric gradients are readily observed.
      Hence, one turns to heavy (massive) dielectric materials to
      observe these effects. This is probably the reason why rocks
      intrinsically show electric polarization --- the so-called
      self-polarization. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Properties of qualight homologous to
      those of light: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Refraction: Bending of qualight by
      massive bodies seems a reasonable assumption. This will be
      developed in greater detail. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) Re-Radiation (Fluorescence): </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When qualight is absorbed by a mass,
      energy is converted to electricity which, if not conducted away,
      builds to a maximum or saturation condition. At this point,
      re-radiation takes place. This re-radiation may be electromagnetic
      or gravitic or both. It may be in the form of heat or could (in
      part) be qualight at the same or different frequency. As such, it
      might be termed gravitic fluorescence. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rocks of the earth may show gravitic
      fluorescence. This possibility was discussed in Sec. 183, p. 10.
      The re-emission spectra of various rocks may be quite different,
      so as to create domains on the surface of the earth. (Sec. 157, p.
      100, Notebk 3). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It has been suggested that
      astronomical bodies, such as the moon and the planets (as a whole)
      reradiate, and that the spectral bands may be distinctive to the
      body. Therefore, for example, the re-radiation of gravitic energy
      (qualight) by the moon may be observable on earth. It may have its
      own spectral signature, differing markedly from that of the sun or
      the planets. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 85.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This re-radiation, at the same or
      different frequency may be termed gravitic fluorescence. It is
      homologous to optical fluorescence. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tuned sensors may be able eventually
      to pick up and distinguish lunar fluorescence from that of other
      planets or the sun. Such effects may or may not have tidal
      characteristics. Fluorescence from Mars or Venus may be equally
      observable. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One begins to wonder at this point as
      to possible effects of qualight or gravitic radiation generally
      upon human behavior. Could astrology have some basis in fact? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Are the well-documented correlations
      between the lunar phases (full moon, etc) and police-crime
      frequency and hospital attendance traceable to such a relation?
      Are plant and animal life processes in any way responsive to
      qualight? Certainly, ordinary light has profound basic effects;
      why not qualight as well? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The subject has vast implications. It
      seems to be utterly new and yet not entirely unexpected.
      Throughout biology there has been a thread of mystery which may be
      cleared up, at least in part, by the recognition of such cosmic
      forces. </p>

          Bias Voltage.</i></b><a name="207"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu April 27, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There appear to be a definite relation
      between the conductivity of a rock with the bias voltage applied.
      Increase in bias causes an increase in conductivity. This is to be
      expected if polarization results in facilitating charge-carrier
      separation (electrode and holes) and charge transport. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If incident qualitic radiation
      initially produces charge pairs (the qualitoelectric effect), the
      population of such pairs is directly related to the resultant
      conductivity. And this is further assisted by the existing
      polarization as established by the applied bias. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p86.jpg" width="218" height="181"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">At 220 V bias, rock = &lt;100 K ohms;
      Radiant = &gt; 2 ma.(approximately) </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, it would appear that by
      increasing the bias to the highest practical value, the rock
      conductivity would be increased and, concurrently, permit a more
      reliable measure of the intensity of the incoming radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 87.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this circuitry, it would appear
      that the current readout would indicate the intensity of the
      incident flux. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">High sensitivity indicating (or
      recording) instruments would not be needed. High input impedance
      would not be an important or limiting factor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Using long-life "B" batteries of, say,
      200 V, a portable sensor could easily be constructed, as: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This, of course, assumes a linear
      relation between bias and conductivity. If the relation is not
      linear (or approx so), and resistance is reciprocal, would the
      resistance reach minimum somewhere above 200-300 V? </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, April 27, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous section, it was
      foreseen (based on further confirmation) that very high voltages
      may be the key to obtaining direct conversion of gravitic energy
      into usable electricity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Unbiased rock electricity does not
      have (it seems) a practical and reliable electrical output. But
      with a bias of several kilovolts, it may have. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would seem that rocks (and possibly
      other equivalent forms of dense dielectrics) will act as an
      electromotance when biased to the KV range. It is interesting to
      note that no bias current would be required. Hence, no current is
      consumed in the excitation. The output of the electromotance
      represents the net or usable gain. This gain, then, is the net
      conversion of gravitic energy into electrical energy. Its output
      is DC. </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the above circuit, as soon as the
      rock becomes fully biased (10 KV), it is generating a current in
      excess of the bias current. Minimum energy comes from the exciter
      and the system becomes self-sustaining. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If excessive current is drawn, the
      output voltage may be drawn down to below 10 KV, at which time
      energy is again drawn from the exciter. Output current, therefore,
      is limited to that value where the output voltage does not fall
      below 10 KV. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The output voltage of 10 KV is merely
      illustrative. Larger masses of heavy high-K dielectric (or rocks)
      and very much increased voltages may be used. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, May 1, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It now appears quite definite that the
      sensitivity of the rock sensors is increased by a bias voltage.
      Such a field (through the body of the rock) provides polarization.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Based on the hypothesis that internal
      electric polarization facilitates charge-carrier separation
      (retarding recombination) of the gravitoelectrically-produced
      pairs, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in
      conductivity will be a function of the polarization voltage. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, increasing the applied
      bias increases the rock conductivity. It is quite possible that
      the amplitude of the diurnal or secular variations will be
      increased as well. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A simple suggested circuit is: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p90.jpg" width="583" height="124"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The resistor provides a cushion so as
      to permit the variations in rock output to be observed, yet
      providing a steady polarization voltage to the rock. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 91.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another more sensitive circuit,
      because it permits a balanced or null position, is: </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this circuit, the output of the
      rock is balanced against the steady bias (to a very sensitive null
      position). Any slight change in the resistance of the rock is
      readily observed and recorded. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Circuits as in Fig. 1 and 2 are being
      tested now and the results, so far at least, are quite
      encouraging. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another example of bias-assistance in
      sensors is that of the resistance-diode-capacitance type, the
      so-called "synthetic" rock, as: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the circuit shown in Fig. 4, the
      applied bias opposes the polarity of the resistor diode emf,
      tending to balance the gravitically-generated emf. An adjustable
      resistance, either in parallel or in series with the 1G resistor,
      provides for null adjustment. At null, this makes possible an
      extremely high sensitivity for diurnal measurements. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The sensor is a piezoelectric tube
      (probably lead zirconate or equivalent). It is placed on a thermos
      flask for temperature stability and the flask is covered with
      aluminum foil which is grounded. The coaxial lead to the recorder
      is also shielded and grounded. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is noted that the output, as
      indicated on the strip-chart recorder, shifts from positive to
      negative (polarity reversal) with a definite diurnal cycle which
      does note correlate with room temperature. Placing the sensor in a
      thermos bottle increase its temperature time constant making it
      virtually insensitive to rapid variations in temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 95.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is sensitive, however, to sudden
      atmospheric pressure changes, showing sudden jumps with varying
      wind pressure. Long-term variations in pressure do not show. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, these are present long term
      variations which are diurnal. The interesting finding is that
      there is a fairly regular polarity reversal ( + to - ) in the
      morning and an opposite reversal ( - to + ) in the afternoon.
      During midday, the readings are negative while during the night
      they are positive. Please note, however, that opposite polarities
      (depending on recorder connections) are possible. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is quite clear that polarity
      reversal take place (at this time of the year) about 8 AM and at
      about 6 PM. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In assembling the charts over the last
      20 days, it begins to appear that there may be a sidereal drift of
      4m/day. Assuming an Earth-shading effect, it may mean that the
      source of this radiation is in the region approx 15h RA. Only by
      continuing these observations over a period of several months
      (better 1 year) can one be certain that this sidereal drift

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Diurnal variations are pronounced at
      the penthouse whereas only long-term (secular) variations are
      observed in the vault. Diurnal variations are minimal. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It would appear that ambient mass is
      responsible, acting very much like an electrical capacitance, to
      smooth out more rapid variations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The mechanism is far from being
      understood. Speculating a bit: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Ambient mass may re-radiate
      gravitic (cosmic) radiation on the same (or lower) spectral band.
      As such, it may be viewed as gravitic fluorescence. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 97.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In such an event, the ambient mass may
      become excited in order to re-radiate, and this excitation may
      have persistence, therefore </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) a time lag would be introduced and
      a soothing effect. <br>
      (b) also, possibly energy absorption by the ambient mass, so as to
      reduce the sensor readings. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In general, this would mean that in
      order to observe maximum diurnal variations and all sudden
      changes, elevation (above earth) is important. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Locations in vary tall buildings are
      foreseen, especially where the surrounding walls of the instrument
      room are of light (non-metallic) material. To insure against
      electrostatic gradients, copper screening is suggested. The ideal
      would be a thermally-insulated wooden shack with complete copper
      screening, as high as possible above the earth. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is true that such construction
      would no shield against magnetic fluctuations, but the sensitivity
      to such fluctuations can be determined by deliberately introducing
      magnetic fields throughout the enclosure. The same applies to the
      penetrating em radiation, that which penetrates the copper
      screening. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 98.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now that the equipment is being moved
      to SRI, perhaps some recording might be done at the top of some
      very high building in San Francisco. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another interesting test would be to
      install recording equipment in a mobile lab which could be moved
      to various elevations and regions of various ambient mass. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is with this thought in mind that I
      would like to rent a camper this summer, install recording
      equipment and travel across the USA. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The necessary 115 V AC could be
      supplied by a converter from 12V storage batteries which could be
      recharged periodically. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Perhaps such a trip could start from
      Palo Alto, using the recorders now being shipped to SRI.
      Installation could take place at Polytec Prod. Co. at Menlo Park.

          Sensors.</i></b><a name="212"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honolulu, May 25, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the previous sections, the
      polarization of rock sensors by applying DC was discussed. Rocks
      could be polarized by heating to a temperature above the Curie
      Point, then applying a high voltage field as the rock cools
      through the Curie Point. We might call such electrified rocks
      geoelectrets. See Sec. 172, p. 137, Notebk 3. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If we are ever to extract usable
      energy from rocks, several factors must be considered: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) The rocks must be strongly
      polarized. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) If polarization voltage is
      supplied, the natural electrical resistance of the rock consumes
      energy, converting it into heat (Joule heating) and then lost. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) It is probable that the
      polarization energy may exceed the converted (gravitoelectric)
      energy, i.e., no net gain. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If, however, adequate polarization can
      be maintained by frequent short duration pulses, the situation may
      be corrected. It is proposed, therefore, that high voltage pulses
      (say, 1 millisecond) be substituted for DC excitation, with the
      pulse frequency being determined as needed to maintain a fixed
      polarization. Gravitoelectric energy may then dominate the output.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 100.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The circuit may be as follows (Figures

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Or, a switching arrangement may be
      provided to disconnect the load during the instant of pulse. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is assumed that output voltage
      would decay after each pulse, as Fig. 2. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">But the energy differential would
      favor the output because of the slow decay, being fed by gravitic
      conversion. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Avalon, CA; July 23, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For many years, I have felt that a
      correlation may be found between sidereal radiation and the stock
      market. Even as early as 1937 such a correlation seemed to exist.
      Then, through the years, no positive follow-up occurred and the
      effort was abandoned. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, realizing that the incoming
      radiation covers a broad spectrum, ranging from a few Hz to MHz
      and higher, individual sensors only cover relatively narrow bands.
      Diurnal phasing and secular variations of the various sensors are
      all different. The idea of a general correlation becomes lost in
      the welter of differences. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, by accident, a certain rock
      (Catalina Granite) has been connected to a Triplett meter Model
      8035 Type 1 for several months. Readout has been charted, and a
      phenomenal correlation with the DJ Averages appears to persist. It
      is being watched with great interest. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There appears to be a lag (radiation
      to DJ) of about 4 days. In the earlier correlation (1937 and
      1939), the lag appeared to be about 2 days. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">No explanation seems to exist. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 102.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Charting was started May 31, 1975 and
      is continuing (July 23). Five reversal of trend have, so far,
      taken place. The probability of this is astronomical. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Continual charting is necessary before
      we can be sure, but if a correlation (with a 4-day lag) is, in
      fact, confirmed, the financial possibilities are staggering. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In anticipation of such possibilities,
      I have prepared a prospectus of an experimental market account to
      be known as the magnum Fund. Such a fund would operate under the
      aegis of the Townsend Brown Foundation. Participation might be
      offered to interested scientists or other knowledgeable person
      purely as a venture experiment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If successful, profits would be routed
      into scientific research. The office of the fund would be in
      Sunnyvale, CA with Dean Witter and Co (Palo Alto) as the broker. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Avalon, July 23, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The phenomenon of self-potential in
      rocks was first observed in Catalina granite. For some time it was
      believed that it could be observed only in silicaceous materials,
      but in Hawaii it was also found in beach sand, primarily
      calcareous. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, I am wondering if calcareous
      solids such as bone (human bone) might also give rise to
      self-potentials. It would be interesting to try fresh animal bone
      such as beef), dried bone and even ancient bone to see if an emf
      is present, and (even more significant) if such potential varies
      in a diurnal or secular pattern. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If so, one may speculate on the
      possibility that, in living bone, the bone marrow is affected by
      the electric field, possibly altering the generation of red blood
      cells or the many other complex biochemical functions living bone
      serves in the body. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This may be a clue as to the
      mechanisms by which sidereal radiation may affect man’s mental or
      physical well-being, hence, his mood relative to investments. </p>

          Polarization.</i></b><a name="215"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, CA; Oct. 5, 1975. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The beneficial effects of polarization
      have been repeatedly observed. There is no doubt that, by
      initially applying a high voltage to a rock sensor, a higher
      reading (output) is obtained. The rock acts like a storage
      battery, retaining a charge for long periods of time. But unlike a
      capacitor, the charge cannot be instantly shorted. It tends to
      return to its former value. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, over long periods of time,
      the charge gradually diminishes and some rocks "go dead". It is
      obvious that the rocks have simply become depolarized. Such rocks
      may be reactivated or repolarized by subjecting them to a high
      voltage, especially when the potential is maintained or several
      days. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Since it is believed the incoming
      radiation (possibly gravitational radiation) produces RF in the
      body of the rock, a method is herein suggested to maintain
      polarization. </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <p><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20Scientific%20Notebook,%20Vol.%204_files/p104.jpg" width="472" height="177"></p>
    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 105.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The use of a diode to rectify the RF
      supplies a DC polarization voltage. The diode passes pulses only
      in one direction and will continue to charge the rock so long as
      the rock output (DC) potential does not exceed the peak inverse of
      the diode. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Units of this type may be placed in
      series to produce and maintain higher output potentials. This may
      be the answer to a commercially useful power source, as: </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Before connecting the diodes, the rock
      slabs should be individually polarized (or if a high voltage ---
      RF --- is used, the entire series may be polarized at once). The
      diodes are connected only after the voltage has fallen to a value
      below the peak inverse of the diodes. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such a circuit may prevent
      depolarization. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the foregoing sections, various
      methods have been proposed to maintain polarization in rocks. In
      Sec. 209, a simple circuit is described to accomplish this. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This circuit now appears to deserve
      further consideration and testing. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Koolau Plug rock normally has a
      self-potential at room temperature of about 400 mV. Using a
      bleeder-type charging circuit to balance the load of the readout,
      this self-potential is greatly increased: </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Starting today, this circuit, using
      400 V power supply and 2G resistors, is being tested for diurnal
      fluctuations. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Polarized piezoelectric ceramic
      cylinders were tested in Hawaii, See Sec. 200 and 210. The
      characteristic of retained polarization appeared to make them
      effective sensors. This work should be continued. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Now, it appears that ordinary high-K
      ceramic capacitors are good sensors for diurnal variation and
      glitches. The so-called "cartwheels" --- 2000 uufd are examples.
      Even without polarization, the observed diurnal fluctuations are
      striking. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In tests now underway, five cartwheels
      are connected in parallel. Vestigial self-potential is present to
      a few millivolts. These capacitors are aligned, when connected
      together, so that the self-potential or remnant polarizations are
      in the same direction. Squeezing the individual capacitors with
      the fingers produces a voltage shift of all five units in the same
      direction. This, of course, is a piezoelectric effect shared by
      most ceramic capacitors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The capacitors are then connected in
      parallel, enclosed in a plastic (insulating) bag which is then
      wrapped in aluminum foil which is grounded. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 109.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The assembly is placed in the constant
      temperature (90 F) box and connected directly to a millivolt
      recorder. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Rapid variations are observed, so that
      it is helpful to connect a 2 ufd polycarbonate capacitor to smooth
      the output. </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Three glitches have appeared to date
      (2 neg and 1 pos) which instantly carried the recorder pen to the
      chart limit. Recovery to the original reading took place within a
      few minutes. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The rapid fluctuations (extreme
      sensitivity) is a feature of this system. Diurnal cycles, even at
      constant temperature, are clearly evident. Atmospheric
      (barometric) pressure does not seem to be responsible or even to
      affect the voltage output. Vibration, within the limits of
      observation during the tests, likewise appears to have no effect.

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, CA; April 22, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">From the very beginning of this
      gravitational research (Janesville, 1926), lead monoxide
      (litharge) has been used as a high-K dielectric material. The
      advantage stems from is high density (mass as well as its high
      dielectric constant (K). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Early gravitators were made of
      litharge bound in paraffin or beeswax. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">More recently, litharge-glycerine
      mixtures have been used. This is not actually a mixture but a
      chemical compound, inasmuch as a chemical reaction takes place
      following mixing. This reaction is exothermic, resulting in a
      rock-hard mass which is quite heavy and, after drying, is a good
      (high-K) dielectric. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sensors made of this material appear
      to develop self-potential with higher current capabilities.
      Internal resistance is lower, so that generated power (wattage) is
      higher. This material makes excellent gravitic sensors --- not
      particularly piezoelectric and only slightly pyroelectric. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, the direction this research
      seems to be taking is toward the more massive metal oxides and
      carbides as dielectric materials. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 111.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One of the most promising appears to
      be tungsten carbide (WC). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tungsten carbide powder or granules
      bound in Carnauba wax is suggested. Tests are being planned. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The electret ability of Carnauba wax
      is well known. It is the classic electret material, capable of
      generating (more accurately, retaining) quite high voltage, even
      in the K range when properly polarized. But the resistance of
      Carnauba wax is so high that only microamperes can be withdrawn.
      The output energy is entirely related to and dependent upon the
      (input) polarization energy. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The thought now is that by loading
      Carnauba wax with tungsten carbide powder, the resulting massive
      electret would gain energy from gravitic radiation, acting as a
      converter as well as a storage device. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tungsten carbide has a very high
      density (specific gravity) almost that of gold. The carbide has a
      fairly high electrical resistance, so that it may make an ideal
      material for gravitic sensors. Tests of this material are being
      planned at the present time at UC Berkeley. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the foregoing section, tungsten
      carbide was suggested as a suitable high-output gravitic sensor.
      The high density of tungsten and the carbide make it particularly
      desirable as a gravitic radiation receptor. The carbide powder is
      mixed in a suitable liquid binder such as Carnauba wax (molten)
      and polarized during cooling and solidification. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To reduce thermal effects
      (pyroelectricity), casting may be done in Dewar flasks. High
      voltage DC is applied during cooling to polarize the sensor. </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is believed that the use of WC will
      provide relatively high self-potential. If allowed to cool and
      settle slowly, compacting the WC particles, a lower internal
      resistance will result. This will produce a higher power output
      (watts). </p>

      glycerin and litharge (PbO) was discussed. A small shielded sensor
      (aluminum box 2 x 4 x 6) has been tested and found to be one of
      the best sensors made to date. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tests at the UC Berkeley indicate that
      its power peak is somewhere near 100,000 ohms. Continuous voltage
      output of approx 5 mV was obtained with a 10,000 ohm resistance
      load. The output undergoes a surprisingly smooth diurnal cycle of
      approx 20 mV with the Houston recorder as the only load (100
      megaohm). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Strangely, this sensor reversed
      polarity when it was moved from Berkeley to Sunnyvale. At the
      moment, it is operating in my apartment in Sunnyvale, ranging from
      –2 to –20 mV. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Originally, it was polarized
      (positive) with 300 V DC, while it was hardening. At Berkeley, it
      indicated approx +50 mV. The reason for reversal of polarity is

      UC Berkeley. It has a sudden commencement at 0300 PST (110 GMT) on
      Tuesday, May 4. Catalina granite went off-scale at 97 mV; its peak
      could not be traced. Barium titanate peaked 28 minutes later (20%
      rise) --- voltage gain from 6.96 to 8.35 mV, then fell to a
      minimum at 0350, a total duration of approx 50 minutes. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be pointed out that this
      event occurred in the mineshaft early in the morning. No person
      was present. Power failure (or surge) was ruled out by
      investigation by Jim Jardine, who deliberately produced failure
      the following morning with no similar effect. Instrumental trouble
      also was ruled out. The glitch appears genuine. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is noted that this event occurred
      at approx 17h sidereal time, at approx upper meridian transit of
      the galactic center. This may or may not be a coincidence. In any
      event, it is a strong (pulse) increase in energy recorded in two
      different dielectrics. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, May 10, 1976 </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Because of their high
      capacitance-to-volume ratio, electrolytic capacitors are generally
      used in compact circuitry. Because of their electrolytic
      (electrochemical) construction, they usually generate a small emf.
      This emf is often temperature related. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, it now turns out that these
      compact capacitors may also be gravito-voltaic. Test with Mallory
      18,000 ufd reveal a surprising diurnal variation at constant
      temperature. Voltage ranges from –0.5 to –1.5 mV during recordings
      today. It is noted that the polarity of the self-potential is
      reversed fro that indicated as the working polarity of the
      capacitor. Phase is also reversed, with maximum occurring at
      approx 10 AM and minimum late at night. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Jim Jardine reports that a [blank] ufd
      electrolytic (at UC Berkeley) shows a pronounced diurnal (and
      other) variations which surprised him. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I plan to put the Mallory 18,000 ufd
      in the constant temperature box in the mine. Results will be
      reported. </p>

          Great Pyramid.</i></b><a name="223"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is fascinating to speculate on the
      reasons for building the pyramids of Egypt and, for that matter,
      the massive stone monuments of the Yucatan Peninsula and
      elsewhere. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thoughts have been expressed that some
      form of energy may be concentrated by the peculiar (pyramid)
      shape. Is it possible that this may be true? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Measurement of self-potential in the
      mineshaft at Berkeley indicate a greater flux density than
      outside. If this flux is gravitic radiation (possibly in the
      optical frequency range), perhaps the same king of increase may be
      present within the pyramids. Reradiation of the incident primary
      (from space) by a rock mass may be termed gravitic fluorescence
      (see Sec. 211). The reradiated energy may have different spectral
      characteristics from the primary. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Gravitic fluorescence, it is
      conceived, would be homologous to optical fluorescence. For
      example, minerals fluoresce under UV light. The color is
      characteristic if the mineral, not of the incident UV. The
      re-emission of energy is at a lower frequency. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 117.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the case of gravitic fluorescence
      of granite, the primary radiation from space may have optical
      frequency, even quasi-UV, and the re-emission may be gravitic in
      the Angstrom range or lower. As such, it would be invisible and
      non-detectable as an em radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, if the granite of the
      great pyramid serves to intercept and re-emit primary gravitic
      radiation from space, the flux density at the center of the
      pyramid would be greater than outside. There may be, in effect, a
      focusing of the flux toward the pyramid center. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this is so, the King’s Chamber
      would be located near this focus. Did the architects of Cheops
      understand this? Could this knowledge have come from a more
      advanced technology of some extraterrestrial culture? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Is this increased flux density
      observable today? Would granite sensors, such as those we have in
      operation at UC Berkeley (in the mineshaft) reveal a higher
      self-potential? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another point upon which we might
      speculate is the strange and unusual structure of the King’s
      chamber and its overhead or roof. Why is there a series of granite
      rocks, with space between, above the King’s Chamber? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 118.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This strange structure is as follows:

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Could this configuration amplify the
      gravitic flux produced by the body of rock forming the rest of the
      pyramid? Are the limestone blocks insulators? Is this overhead
      arrangement of granite blocks for the purpose of increasing the
      flux density in the King’s Chamber below? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the lab, could we use this
      arrangement of granite slabs (spaced and insulated from each
      other) to intensify gravitic flux density? Would this produce a
      higher self-potential in the bottom rock? </p>

          Secondary Radiation.</i></b><a name="224"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, June 7, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If future experiments to confirm the
      existence of gravitic fluorescence (secondary radiation) from
      rocks, does this radiation have biological effects? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is hard to conceive that Nature has
      failed to utilize this form of energy in one way or another. The
      fact that our human eyes do not perceive it does not mitigate
      against its presence all around us. Do birds or fish perceive it?
      Is the homing instinct related to such possible perception? Were
      the ancients aware of its existence and/or influence? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the foregoing section, the thought
      was advanced that the pyramids (and other prehistoric stone
      structures) might be receptors and concentrators of gravitic flux.
      Were the architects aware of the possible effects even though they
      may not have known the reasons? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Was the geometrical shape of the
      pyramids convenient as a burial mausoleum for kings or was the
      shape chosen for other (perhaps advanced) esoteric reasons? Did a
      more advanced culture (perhaps extraterrestrial) dictate the
      pyramid shape to accomplish some result? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 120.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Was this shape purposely selected and
      utilized to aid the king in the afterlife? If so, would the
      increased flux density esoterically assist toward this end? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is rather amazing to see that the
      sarcophagus (believed to have held the king’s body at one time) is
      located exactly at the center of the pyramid (Cheops) and at a
      location which could be the focus of secondary radiation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It has been reported that
      mummification is accelerated in the pyramid and that organic
      bodies do not decay. Could this radiation be responsible? If so,
      does such radiation assist organic processes or suppress them? Is
      such intense flux life-giving or death oriented? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">What of the many explorers who have
      penetrated the pyramids in the past? Men who have spent long
      periods, cutting into corridors, mapping and studying? Was their
      health or longevity affected? I should like to conduct some
      research on the subject. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In any event, it would be worthwhile
      to study the possibility that secondary radiation may have
      profound effects on biological processes, beneficial or
      detrimental. Could stone or concrete buildings, for example, prove
      to be hazardous to health and well-being --- perhaps even
      carcinogenic? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 121.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In this age of concrete buildings, are
      we overlooking one of the reasons for increased incidence of
      cancer? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Some measurements of gravitic flux
      density must be made. A portable sensor, similar to a Geiger
      counter, would be very helpful. As a geophysical survey tool, a
      gravitic flux meter may be used to map subsurface domains of
      granite or geothermal reservoirs, even perhaps deposits of
      minerals or oil. It is with this end in view that I am hoping to
      fit out a mobile laboratory or survey vehicle (camper) to conduct
      profile studies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such studies may provide isometric
      maps of natural flux density across various California (and other)
      regions which may be extremely valuable. No other survey tool,
      available today, could provide such information. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A flux meter of this type could be
      used in the determination of pyramid radiation, if such radiation
      does, in fact, exist. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A group from SRI pans to make a trip
      to Egypt this summer in connection with other studies. It is our
      hope that they will be able to take a gravitic flux meter with
      them, specifically to use in the Cheops pyramid. </p>

          Materials and Binders.</i></b><a name="225"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, June 9, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Receptors</i>: In looking for
      possible receptor materials, the principal characteristics would
      seem to be mass and high dielectric constant. Conducting metals
      are excluded because of usual inability to obtain voltage
      gradients in thicker sections. In thin sections (filiform) there
      is a chance that usable self-potential can be obtained. Long thin
      wire sensors will be discussed in the next section (226). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In general, high-mass sensors must be
      of high-resistance materials. Lead monoxide (PbO) was the first of
      such materials to be tested. It is heavy and has a high electrical
      resistance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Barium titanate and lead
      zirconate-titanate are similarly effective. Both have been used in
      sensors made to date. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tungsten carbide is a new contender
      for the honors and promises to be even more effective (See Sec.
      219). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">These heavy powders may be bonded by
      compression, sintering, or by the use of a binder. Initial
      polarization is not normally possible during compression or
      sintering, although in the future some technique may be worked
      out. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 123.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Binders</i>: Several liquid binders
      are possible which can permit polarization during hardening. Among
      them are the waxes, such as paraffin, beeswax and Carnauba wax.
      Polarization is accomplished by applying a high-voltage field as
      the binder hardens upon cooling. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Other binders such as polyurethane and
      methyl acrylate harden by the use of an accelerator. There are
      many plastics of this nature which may be used to bind the
      receptor materials. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another interesting possibility is
      ordinary Portland cement. When mixed with water it is electrically
      conducting, but its resistance increases as it sets. Concrete
      blocks may prove to be effective sources of gravitic
      self-potential. If the aggregate is crushed granite, monazite sand
      or even such receptor material as tungsten carbide, the use of
      Portland cement (or the like) may be quite effective. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It must be borne in mind that the
      internal resistance of a gravitic battery must be low if high
      currents are required. If only high voltage is required, the
      internal resistance may be high. Peak power output from any
      receptor material depends upon matching the internal resistance
      with the load. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, June 9, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The generation of white RF noise in
      long wires was discussed in Sec. 140 and 180. This RF is rectified
      by a diode and stored in a capacitor (as DC). If the molecules of
      the metal forming the wire are polarized aligned) by a strong
      current while the metal is cooling from a high temperature, the
      long wire becomes polarized so as to produce a DC self-potential.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Thus, the metal of the wire becomes a
      gravitic receptor. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tungsten, due to its high mass (sp.
      gr. 18) in fine wire form appears to be ideal. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A tungsten wire sensor would then be a
      non-inductive resistor of very fine wire which has been cooled

          Resistors.</i></b><a name="228"></a> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, June 11, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 226, the idea of long-wire
      sources of self-potential was set forth. The thought was developed
      that long wires of massive materials (such as tungsten) being
      cooled while conducting a current, would retain a polarization
      which would result in a continuing self-potential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this is so, long-wire resistors may
      be made gravitovoltaic by subjecting them to a high initial
      voltage, then lowering the voltage slowly as the resistor cools.
      The high initial voltage and current aligns the constituent
      molecular dipoles which remain aligned as the current drops and
      temperature is lowered past the Curie temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, resistive materials in general,
      if heated by excessive DC current above the Curie point, then
      allowed to cool, would thereafter become a source of
      self-potential. In other words, an overloaded resistor may become
      a battery. This would, indeed, be a surprising discovery if valid.
    </p>
    <center style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 127.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One wonders why this effect has not
      been noticed before. High voltage resistors have been operated at
      high currents with seemingly constant characteristics, or have
      they? If anomalies have been noted, perhaps they have been
      attributed to errors in observation. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming that long-wire resistors can
      be polarized by DC overloading so that they will (thereafter)
      produce a voltage, the problem of creating a useful battery may be
      solved. The internal resistance may be selected to match the load
      and hence provide peak power output. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Various metals, not necessarily
      tungsten, may have differing characteristics, as to Curie
      temperature, retention of polarization, and resultant
      self-potential. Tungsten was originally suggested because of its
      high density, but aluminum, iron, copper, nichrome and many other
      metals, alloys or even ductile ceramets may prove to be better. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">After all, there is very little basic
      difference between resistive materials in so far as the ability to
      generate self-potential is concerned. Mass (density) is important.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In Sec. 219, tungsten carbide (WC) was
      proposed as a probable effective material for a battery. Much
      depends upon its electrical resistance. This will have to be
      researched. The high mass of tungsten compounds appears to make
      them ideal as gravitic receptors. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tungsten carbide (WC), bitungsten
      carbide (W2C), thorium tungsten and the like may be compressed (as
      powders) into a heavy semi-conducting mass. Better still, if high
      temperature casting is possible, or if the material is sintered,
      the resultant mass may make an effective battery. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such a mass would be heated above the
      electrical Curie temperature and then, in the presence of a high
      electric field, oil-quenched (or otherwise cooled) to retain
      electric polarization. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Also present is a vertical anisotropy,
      wherein the maximum voltage always appears when the front end is
      up, i.e., toward the zenith. In most observations, voltage at
      zenith is double the voltage at nadir. This appears to have no
      relation to the proximity or direction of an electric line. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When the sensor (resistor, diode,
      capacitor combination) is horizontal, the azimuth effects are
      observable with greatest voltage when the front (end) is directed
      toward the south (presumably the magnetic south). When in this
      position, voltage is further increased when the south end is
      raised (presumably to the point (angle) where the sensor is
      aligned with the magnetic declination). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To be convincing, this experiment must
      be repeated out in the open, away from power lines, etc., which
      now confuse the results. Shielding studies should also be carried
      on, although shielding may cancel out the basic effect in which we
      are interested. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this phenomenon is indicative of an

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Where an emf is generated (as in any
      kind of electromotance, such as a battery), and the external
      circuit has low resistance, the internal resistance (of the

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This Joule heating will undoubtedly be
      present if a petroelectric source is shorted. An active
      petroelectric sensor should become warmer than its ambient if it
      is electrically shorted. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The energy of the evolved heat may be
      converted from optical frequency gravitational radiation.
      Increased petroelectric voltage would cause increased heating.
      Therefore, the temperature would necessarily correlate with the
      diurnal or secular variations in the gravitic input. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If this is true, certain rocks or
      other gravitovoltaic materials (if shorted) will be warmer than
      their environment. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 132.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This presents some interesting
      possibilities. For example, a large rock (in nature) may be
      petroelectrically active, but will not be warmer than the
      environment until it is electrically shorted. If, however, it is
      finely ground and the sand-like particles are mixed, and if the
      particles themselves are petroelectrically active, it follows that
      shorting per se results from the interacting of the particles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Conclusion:</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Finely ground petroelectric
      material (especially when compressed) may be found to be warmer
      than the environment. This spontaneous evolution of heat may show
      the same diurnal and secular variations as the unground pieces
      which are electrically shorted. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) The spontaneous evolution of heat
      of certain complex silicates, lavas and clays (ref, Charles F.
      Brush) may be due to gravitoelectric conversion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) Such heating would be directly
      related to the energy (at that frequency) of the incident
      optical-frequency gravitic radiation </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This phenomenon appears to be the same
      as that discovered by C.F. Brush in Sandusky clay and related
      materials. Calorimetric tests were performed by Harrington,
      National Bureau of Standards. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">For some time, I have toyed with the
      idea that the electric permitivity of space, as well a the
      magnetic permeability, is not constant but varies from place to
      place, as, for example, in regions of great gravitational
      potential. Ref. Sec. 109 (1973). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Further, it would appear that
      variations with time may appear, as, for example, with the passage
      of a gravitational wave. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, a K-wave may be
      indistinguishable from a gravitational wave, one being concurrent
      with the other. The gravitational wave would be difficult to
      detect, but the K-wave may be relatively easy to detect. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Reviewing the proposal set forth in

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the K of the ambient space varies,
      the low-K Pyranol would be (percentagewise) affected more than the

      indicating high resistance multivoltmeter would reveal the
      differential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Both types of capacitors will have

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The relatively large amplitude of the
      secular and diurnal variations make it difficult to set alarm
      limits (contacts) for glitch warning signals. A continually moving

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the various tests using
      electrolytic capacitors as storage means, the question has arisen
      as to the capacitor stability. Do such capacitors develop
      self-potential similar to rocks? Is such self-potential (if it
      exists) due to an electrochemical or gravitic source? Does it
      partake in diurnal fluctuations which are not related to changes

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the foregoing section,
      consideration was given to the spontaneous emf produced by
      electrolytic capacitors. Using high-capacitance units, such as
      Mallory 3V, 115,000 ufd, with a standard cell 3V bucking circuit,
      measurements are proposed for detection of charging-discharging
      rate, as: </p>

    </center>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The capacitor is initially charged to
      3V by closing switch, allowing sufficient time to become
      thoroughly saturated. Then the switch is opened. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The conductivity of the mV meter is
      such as to (normally) keep the capacitor fully charged
      (polarized). Any variation in the self-potential of the capacitor
      (above below 3V) will be indicated as a plus or minus voltage by
      the meter. All this assumes, of course, that the standard cell
      voltage remains constant. This test should be conducted at

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Results</i>: Battery constant at
      1.542 V, the capacitor stabilized at approx 1.080 V, the readout
      represented the difference 0.462 V. But the readout underwent
      systematic variations not entirely due to temperature changes.
      Variations occurred while room temperature remained constant.
      Furthermore, a strong glitch occurred between 0600 and 0610 (temp.
      steady at 66 F) today of magnitude 26 mV. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is to be understood that during
      this glitch the capacitor emf fell 26 mV and then returned to its
      former value within 10 minutes. No external factors were observed
      which could have accounted for the sudden voltage drop. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 142.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In an attempt to understand the
      significance of this negative glitch, the following thoughts come
      to mind. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) It must be recognized that the
      energy storage in a 115,000 ufd capacitor is relatively great.
      Over short periods of time, such as 10 minutes, high stability
      would be expected. What could cause momentary loss of voltage with
      subsequent complete recovery? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) If the stored energy remained
      constant, voltage change could (I believe) result from a momentary
      change in the dielectric constant (K) of the dielectric material
      of the capacitor. A sudden increase in K would cause a
      proportionate decrease in V. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">(3) A similar result might come from a
      sudden increase in the conductivity of the dielectric. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Hence, the voltage dip may be caused
      by (1) an increase in K, or (2) an increase in conductivity
      (decrease of resistance). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Ionizing radiation, such as a cosmic
      ray shower or gamma ray burst from space could, I suppose, produce
      a sudden increase in conductivity. If so, the use of electrolytic
      capacitors as sensors for such penetrating radiation would be
      worth investigating. To my knowledge, no such evidence exists
      today. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 143.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">One must consider the observed fact
      that the voltage returned to its former value after the glitch. If
      the momentary effect resulted from an increase in conductivity,
      would there not be a loss of energy (Joule heating?), although
      this loss, of course, if it exists, would be miniscule and
      probably not observable. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The remaining possibility which must
      be recognized is a momentary change in K of the dielectric. Could
      such a change be induced by incident radiation or by the ambient
      K, perhaps even a K-wave from space? See Sec. 234. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The possibility of detecting K waves
      is certainly exciting. If such waves do exist in space, what is
      their origin and velocity? Are K waves limited to the velocity of
      light? Do they convey energy? If not, why should they be limited
      to the velocity of light? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">As to their possible effects, are they
      observable only in capacitors? Are high-K capacitors more
      receptive? Are there other manifestations in cosmology, such as
      pulsing red-shifts or other anomalous optical phenomena? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The study of electrolytic sensors must

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the circuit shown in Fig. 1, p.
      141, the meter reads in mV but actually, because of the meter
      resistance, the reading represents current. Due to the slight
      conductivity of the capacitor, this current is always positive.
      The capacitor losses always draw energy from the battery. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A high voltage bias is preferred in
      order to pass sufficient current through 2G ohm resistors to
      effect a null in the recording meter. In other words, the high
      resistance places no load on the capacitor emf. Once adjusted to
      null, so that the capacitor is charged to a value equal to that of
      the battery, the meter will thereafter reflect the voltage
      differential between battery and capacitor. Such a circuit should
      have great sensitivity. Alarm contacts on the recorder could

      random and do not appear to be related to diurnal or secular

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It now appears that electrolytic

      which are not shared by standard resistors to the same extent, A
      bridge circuit to establish a null provides a very sensitive
      detection circuit. By using an audio amplifying system in place of
      the millivolt meter, audio detection of the incoming (cosmic)
      signals may be possible. Care must be taken to avoid exceeding the

      evenly divided between the resistors and the capacitors. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sunnyvale, Feb 3, 1976. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The recent discovery that electrolytic
      capacitors of very high capacitance are similar in behavior to
      rocks is surprising and perhaps quite significant. The problem in
      this ongoing research has always been the behavior of massive
      high-K dielectrics. Aluminum electrolytic dielectrics are
      certainly included in this classification. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The fundamental phenomenon seems to be
      the spontaneous generation of an emf so-called self-potential.
      Concurrently, an apparent change in resistance is present. At
      first glance, one would conclude that the emf is caused by an
      internal battery action of chemical origin (galvanism). This would
      be especially understandable in the case of electrolytic
      capacitors, but would not be explicable with rock self-potential.
      Even so, the emf developed would surely be temperature dependent,
      and this, it appears, is true. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When one considers the changes in
      resistance (or conductivity) of both electrolytic capacitors and
      rocks, apart from their self-potential (counter-emf), the thought
      of a penetrating ionizing radiation presents itself. Any increase
      in such radiation would cause an increase in conductivity or a
      decrease in apparent resistance. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 149.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If K-waves exist, coming from space,
      the change in dielectric constant of both capacitors and rocks
      would, conceivably, cause proportionate voltage changes. But these
      would not be conductivity changes, only apparent resistance
      changes caused internally by the so-called counter-emf. Hence, it
      becomes important to distinguish between true changes in emf and
      conductivity. These factors are not readily separated. Only by
      concurrently observing each one separately can this be
      accomplished. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Effects of Temperature ---</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">There is a direct relationship,
      although somewhat complex and certainly not proportionate, between
      temperature and self-potential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Conductivity is also directly related,
      but also complex and not proportionate. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Both self-potential and conductivity
      are influenced (obviously) by unknown external factors. Hence, to
      obtain pure results, all tests must be conducted at constant
      temperature. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Glitches ---</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Both positive and negative glitches
      have been observed. If ionizing radiation is considered, a sudden
      increase (flare) would cause an increase in conductivity in all
      sensors, possibly also in self-potential. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, it is noted that glitches are
      usually negative (in electrolytic sensors) and therefore would
      indicate a decrease in ionizing radiation (if such exists). </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Page 150.</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This hardly seems plausible in view of
      such possible effects as gamma ray bursts or cosmic ray showers,
      which always increases in ionization and, hence, increases in
      conductivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Changes in ambient (or internal) K, as
      from the passage of a K-wave would (1) increase the emf as K is
      lowered, and increase current flow or apparent conductivity; (2)
      decrease the above if K is raised. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A negative glitch, therefore, may mean
      a momentary increase in ambient K. Diurnal changes, as reported in
      Sec. 233, could mean, therefore, K is high when V is down, making
      the curve of K similar to the curves shown on p. 135, that is,
      highest at noon, lowest about midnight. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Conclusions:</i> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">It now appears that ionizing radiation
      is not responsible for the observed effects, either in capacitors
      or rocks. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Another presently unknown factor must
      be responsible. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">K-waves or gravitational radiation are
      candidates, but no conclusions can yet be reached. </p>
