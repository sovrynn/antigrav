        <p align="left">There is a decided tendency in the physical
          sciences to unify the great basic laws and to relate, by a
          single structure or mechanism, such individual phenomena as
          gravitation, electrodynamics and even matter itself. It is
          found that matter and electricity are very closely related in
          structure. In the final analysis matter loses its traditional
          individuality and becomes merely an "electrical condition." In
          fact, it might be said that the concrete body of the universe
          is nothing more than an assemblage of energy which, in itself,
          is quite intangible. Of course, it is self-evident that matter
          is connected with gravitation and it follows logically that
          electricity is likewise connected. These relations exist in
          the realm of pure energy and consequently are very basic in
          nature. In all reality <i>they constitute the true backbone
            of the universe</i>. It is needless to say that the
          relations are not simple, and full understanding of their
          concepts is complicated by the outstanding lack of information
          and research on the real nature of gravitation. </p>
        <p align="left">The theory of relativity introduced a new and
          revolutionary light to the subject by injecting a new
          conception of space and time. Gravitation thus becomes the
          natural outcome of so-called "distorted space." It loses its
          Newtonian interpretation as a tangible mechanical force and
          gains the rank of an "apparent" force, due merely to the
          condition of space itself. </p>
        <p align="left">Fields in space are produced by the presence of
          material bodies or electric charges. They are gravitational
          fields or electric fields according to their causes.
          Apparently they have no connection one with the other. This
          fact is substantiated by observations to the effect that
          electric fields can be shielded and annulled while
          gravitational fields are nearly perfectly penetrating. This
          dissimilarity has been the chief hardship to those who would
          compose a Theory of Combination. </p>
        <p align="left">It required Dr. Einstein's own close study for a
          period of several years to achieve the results others have
          sought in vain and to announce with certainty the unitary
          field laws. </p>
        <p align="left">Einstein's field theory is purely mathematical.
          It is not based on the results of any laboratory test and does
          not, so far as known, predict any method by which an actual
          demonstration or proof may be made. The new theory
          accomplishes its purpose by "rounding out" the accepted
          Principles of Relativity so as to embrace electrical
          phenomena. </p>
        <p align="left">The Theory of Relativity thus supplemented
          represents the last word in mathematical physics. It is most
          certainly a theoretical structure of overpowering magnitude
          and importance. The thought involved is so far reaching that
          it may be many years before the work is fully appreciated and
          understood. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Early Investigations ~</b> </p>
        <p align="left">The writer and his colleagues anticipated the
          present situation even as early as 1923, and began at that
          time to construct the necessary theoretical bridge between the
          two then separate phenomena, electricity and gravitation. The
          first actual demonstration of the relation was made in 1924.
          Observations were made of the individual and combined motions
          of two heavy lead balls which were suspended by wires 45 cm.
          apart. The balls were given opposite electrical charges and
          the charges were maintained. Sensitive optical methods were
          employed in measuring the movements, and as near as could be
          observed the balls appeared to behave according to the
          following law: "Any system of two bodies possesses a mutual
          and unidirectional force (typically in the line of the bodies)
          which is directly proportional to the product of the masses,
          directly proportional to the potential difference and
          inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
          them." </p>
        <p align="left">The peculiar result is that the gravitational
          field of the Earth had no apparent connection with the
          experiment. The gravitational factors entered through the
          consideration of the mass of the electrified bodies. </p>
        <p align="left">The newly discovered force was quite obviously
          the resultant physical effect of an electro-gravitational
          interaction. It represented the first actual evidence of the
          very basic relationship. The force was named "gravitator
          action" for want of a better term and the apparatus or system
          of masses employed was called a "gravitator." </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Figure 1 ~</b> </p>

        </div>
        <p align="left">Since the time of the first test the apparatus
          and the methods used have been greatly improved and
          simplified. Cellular "gravitators" have taken the place of the
          large balls of lead. Rotating frames supporting two and four
          gravitators have made possible acceleration measurements.
          Molecular gravitators made of solid blocks of massive
          dielectric have given still greater efficiency. Rotors and
          pendulums operating under oil have eliminated atmospheric
          considerations as to pressure, temperature and humidity. The
          disturbing effects of ionization, electron emission and pure
          electro-statics have likewise been carefully analyzed and
          eliminated. Finally after many years of tedious work and with
          refinement of methods we succeeded in observing the
          gravitational variations produced by the moon and sun and much
          smaller variations produced by the different planets. It is a
          curious fact that the effects are most pronounced when the
          affecting body is in the alignment of the differently charged
          elements and least pronounced when it is at right angles. </p>
        <p align="left">Much of the credit for this research is due to
          Dr. Paul Biefield, Director of Swazey Observatory. The writer
          is deeply indebted to him for his assistance and for his many
          valuable and timely suggestions. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Gravitator Action an Impulse ~</b> </p>
        <p align="left">Let us take, for example, the case of a
          gravitator totally immersed in oil but suspended so as to act
          as a pendulum and swing along the line of its elements. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Figure 2 ~</b> </p>
        <div align="left">
          <center><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20British%20Patent%20%23%20300,311%20--%20Gravitator_files/00fig2.gif" width="257" height="334"></center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">When the direct current with high voltage
          (75-300 kilovolts) is applied the gravitator swings up the arc
          until its propulsive force balances the force of the earth's
          gravity resolved to that point, then it stops, but it does not
          remain there. The pendulum then gradually returns to the
          vertical or starting position even while the potential is
          maintained. The pendulum swings only to one side of the
          vertical. Less than five seconds is required for the test
          pendulum to reach the maximum amplitude of the swing but from
          thirty to eighty seconds are required for it to return to
          zero. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Figure 3 ~</b> </p>
        <div align="left">
          <center><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20British%20Patent%20%23%20300,311%20--%20Gravitator_files/00fig3.gif" width="253" height="285"></center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">The total time or duration of the impulse varies
          with such cosmic conditions as the relative position and
          distance of the moon, sun and so forth. It is in no way
          affected by fluctuations in the supplied voltage and averages
          the same for every mass or material under test. The duration
          of the impulse is governed solely by the condition of the
          gravitational field. It is a value which is unaffected by
          changes in the experimental set-up, voltage applied or type of
          gravitator employed. Any number of different kinds of
          gravitators operating simultaneously on widely different
          voltages would reveal exactly the same impulse duration at any
          instant. Over an extended period of time all gravitators would
          show equal variations in the duration of the impulse. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Figure 4 ~</b> </p>
        <div align="left">
          <center><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20British%20Patent%20%23%20300,311%20--%20Gravitator_files/00fig4.gif" width="253" height="409"></center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">After the gravitator is once fully discharged,
          its impulse exhausted, the electrical potential must be
          removed for at least five minutes in order that it may
          recharge itself and regain its normal gravitic condition. The
          effect is much like that of discharging and charging a storage
          battery, except that electricity is handled in a reverse
          manner. When the duration of the impulse is great the time
          required for complete recharge is likewise great. The times of
          discharge and recharge are always proportional. Technically
          speaking, the exo-gravitic rate and the endo-gravitic rate are
          proportional to the gravitic capacity. </p>
        <p align="left">Summing up the observations of the
          electro-gravitic pendulum the following characteristics are
          noted: </p>
        <p align="left">APPLIED VOLTAGE determines only the amplitude of
          the swing. </p>
        <p align="left">APPLIED AMPERAGE is only sufficient to overcome
          leakage and maintain the required voltage through the losses
          of the dielectric. Thus the total load approximates on 37
          ten-millionths of an ampere. It apparently has no other
          relation to the movement at least from the present state of
          physics. </p>
        <p align="left">MASS of the dielectric is a factor in
          determining the total energy involved in the impulse. For a
          given amplitude an increase in mass is productive of an
          increase in the energy exhibited by the system (E = mg). </p>
        <p align="left">DURATION OF THE IMPULSE with electrical
          conditions maintained is independent of all of the foregoing
          factors. It is governed solely by external gravitational
          conditions, positions of the moon, sun, etc., and represents
          the total energy or summation of energy values which are
          effective at that instant. </p>
        <p align="left"><b>Figure 5 ~</b> </p>
        <div align="left">
          <center><img src="Thomas%20Townsend%20Brown_%20British%20Patent%20%23%20300,311%20--%20Gravitator_files/00fig5.gif" width="251" height="273"></center>
        </div>
        <p align="left">GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY LEVELS are observable as
          the pendulum returns from the maximum deflection to the zero
          point or vertical position. The pendulum hesitates in its
          return movement on definite levels or steps. The relative
          position and influence of these steps vary continuously every
          minute of the day. One step or energy value corresponds in
          effect to each cosmic body that is influencing the electrified
          mass or gravitator. By merely tracing a succession of values
          over a period of time a fairly intelligible record of the
          paths and the relative gravitational effects of the moon, sun,
          etc., may be obtained. </p>
        <p align="left">In general then, every material body possesses
          inherently within its substance separate and distinct energy
          levels corresponding to the gravitational influences of every
          other body. these levels are readily revealed as the
          electro-gravitic impulse dies and as the total gravitic
          content of the body is slowly released. </p>

        <p align="left">The gravitator, in all reality, is a very
          efficient electric motor. Unlike other forms of motors it does
          not in any way involve the principles of electromagnetism, but
          instead it utilizes the newer principles of
          electro-gravitation. A simple gravitator has no moving parts
          but is apparently capable of moving itself from within itself.
          it is highly efficient for the reason that it uses no gears,
          shafts, propellers or wheels in creating its motive power. It
          has no internal resistance and no observable rise in
          temperature. Contrary to the common belief that gravitational
          motors must necessarily be vertical-acting the gravitator, it
          is found, acts equally well in every conceivable direction. </p>
        <p align="left">While the gravitator is at present primarily a
          scientific instrument, perhaps even an astronomical
          instrument, it also is rapidly advancing to a position of
          commercial value. Multi-impulse gravitators weighing hundreds
          of tons may propel the ocean liners of the future. Smaller and
          more concentrated units may propel automobiles and even
          airplanes. Perhaps even the fantastic "space cars" and the
          promised visit to Mars may be the final outcome. Who can tell?

          citizen of the USA, do hereby declare the nature of this
          invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, to
          be particularly described and ascertained in and by the
          following statement: --- </p>
        <p align="left">This invention relates to a method of
          controlling gravitation and for deriving power therefrom, and
          to a method of producing linear force or motion. The method is
          fundamentally electrical. </p>
        <p align="left">The invention also relates to machines or
          apparatus requiring electrical energy that control or
          influence the gravitational field or the energy of
          gravitation; also to machines or apparatus requiring
          electrical energy that exhibit a linear force or motion which
          is believed to be independent of all frames of reference save
          that which is at rest relative to the universe taken as a
          whole, and said linear force or motion is furthermore believed
          to have no equal and opposite reaction that can be observed by
          any method commonly known and accepted by the physical science
          to date. </p>
        <p align="left">The invention further relates to machines or
          apparatus that depend for their force action or motive power
          on the gravitational field or energy of gravitation that is
          being controlled or influenced as above stated; also, to
          machines or apparatus that depend for their force action or
          motive power on the linear force action or motive power on the
          linear force or motion exhibited by such machines or apparatus
          previously mentioned. </p>
        <p align="left">The invention further relates to machines and
          apparatus that derive usable energy or power from the
          gravitational field or from the energy of gravitation by
          suitable arrangement, using such machines and apparatus as
          first above stated as principal agents. </p>
        <p align="left">To show the universal adaptability of my novel
          invention, said method is capable of practical performance and
          use in connection with motors for automobiles, space cars,
          ships, railway locomotion, prime movers for power
          installations, aeronautics. Still another field is the use of
          the method and means enabling the same to function as a
          gravitator weight changer. Specific embodiments of the
          invention will be duly disclosed through the medium of the
          present Specification. </p>

          conducting of excessive heat away from the anode or positive
          electrode by means of air or water cooling devices. </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The general showing in Figure
          1 will make clear how my method for controlling or influencing
          the gravitational field or the energy of gravitation, or for
          producing linear force or motion, is utilized by any machine
          or apparatus having the characteristics now to be pointed out.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Such a machine has two major
          parts A and B. These parts may be composed of any material
          capable of being charged electrically. Mass A and mass B may
          be termed electrodes A and B respectively. Electrode A is
          charged negatively with respect to electrode B, or what is
          substantially the same, electrode B is charged positively with
          respect to electrode A, or what is usually the case, electrode
          A has an excess of electrons while electrode B has an excess
          of protons. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">While charged in this manner
          the total force of A toward B is the sum of force <i>g</i>
          (due to the normal gravitational field) and force <i>c</i>
          (due to the imposed electrical field) and force <i>x</i> (due
          to the resultant of unbalanced gravitational forces caused by
          the electronegative charge or by the presence of an excess of
          electrons on electrode A and by the electro-positive charge or
          the presence of an excess of protons on electrode B. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">By the cancellation of similar
          and opposing forces and by the addition of similar and allied
          forces the two electrodes taken collectively possess a force 2<i>x</i>
          in the direction of B. This force 2<i>x</i> shared by both
          electrodes exists as a tendency of these electrodes to move or
          accelerate in the direction of the force, that is, A toward B
          and B away from A. Moreover any machine or apparatus
          possessing electrodes A and B will exhibit such a lateral
          acceleration or motion of free to move. Such a motion is
          believed to be due to the direct control and influence of the
          energy of gravitation by the electrical energy which exists in
          the unlike electrical charges present on the affected
          electrodes. This motion seems to possess no equal or opposite
          motion that is detectable by the present day mechanics. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">It is to be understood that in
          explaining the theory underlying my invention I am imparting
          by best understanding of that theory, derived from practical
          demonstration by the use of appropriate apparatus made in
          keeping with the teachings of the present Specification. The
          practice of the method, and apparatus aiding in the
          performance of the method, have been successful as herein
          disclosed, and the breadth of my invention and discovery is
          such as to embrace any corrected or more refined theory that
          may be found to underlie the phenomena which I believe myself
          to be the first to discover and put to practical service. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In this Specification I have
          used terms as "gravitator cells" and "gravitator cellular
          body" which are words of my own coining in making reference to
          the particular type of cell I employ in the present invention.
          Wherever the construction involves a pair of electrodes,
          separated by an insulating plate or member, such construction
          complies with the term gravitator cells, and when two or more
          gravitator cells are connected in series within a body, such
          will fall within the meaning of gravitator cellular body. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In Figure 2 the electrodes A
          and B are shown as having placed between them an insulating
          plate or member C of suitable material, such that the minimum
          number of electrons or ions may successfully penetrate it.
          This constitutes a cellular gravitator consisting of one
          gravitator cell. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">A cellular gravitator,
          consisting of more than one cell, will have the cell units
          connected in series. This type is illustrated in Figure 3, D
          being insulating members and E suitable conducting plates. It
          will be readily appreciated that many different arrangements
          for cell units, each possessing distinct advantages, may be
          resorted to. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">One arrangement, such as just
          referred to, is illustrated in Figure 6of the drawings. Here
          the cells designated F are grouped in spaced relation and
          placed evenly around the circumference of a wheel G. Each
          group of cells F possesses a linear acceleration and the wheel
          rotates as a result of the combined forces. It will be
          understood that, the cells being spaced substantial distances
          apart, the separation of adjacent positive and negative
          elements of separate cells is greater than the separation of
          the positive and negative elements of any cell, and the
          materials of which the cells are formed being the more readily
          affected by the phenomena underlying my invention than the
          mere space between adjacent cells, any forces existing between
          positive and negative elements of adjacent cells can never
          become of sufficient magnitude to neutralize or balance the
          force created by the respective cells adjoining said spaces.
          The uses to which such a motor, wheel or rotor may be put are
          practically limitless, as can be readily understood without
          further description. The structure may suitably be called a
          gravitator motor of cellular type. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In keeping with the purpose of
          my invention, an apparatus may employ the electrodes A and B
          within a vacuum tube. This aspect of the invention is shown in
          Figures 4 and 5. In Figure 4 the electrodes are such as are
          adapted to be placed within a vacuum tube H (Figure 5), the
          frame and mounting being well within the province of the
          skilled artisan. Electrons, ions, or thermions can migrate
          readily from A to B. The construction may be appropriately
          termed an electronic, ionic, or thermionic gravitator as the
          case may be. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">In certain of the last named
          types of gravitator units, it is desirable or necessary to
          heat to incandescence the whole or part of electrode A to
          obtain better emission of negative thermions or electrons or
          at least to be able to control that emission by variation in
          the temperature of said electrode A. Since such variations
          also influence the magnitude of the longitudinal force or
          acceleration exhibited by the tube, it proves to be a very
          convenient method of varying the motion of the tube. The
          electrode A may be heated to incandescence in any convenient
          way as by the ordinary methods utilizing electrical resistance
          or electrical induction, an instance of the former being shown
          at J (Figure 5), and an instance of the latter at J' (Figure
          5'), the vacuum tube in Figure 5' being designated H'. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Moreover, in certain types of
          the gravitator units, now being considered, it is advantageous
          or necessary also to conduct away from the anode of positive
          electrode B excessive heat that may be generated during the
          operation of tube H or H'. Such cooling is effected externally
          by means of air or water-cooled flanges that are in thermo
          connection with the anode, or it is effected internally by
          passing a stream of water, air or other fluid through a hollow
          anode made especially for that purpose. Air cooled flanges are
          illustrated at K (Figure 5) and a hollow anode for the
          reception of a cooling liquid or fluid (as air or water) as
          shown at K' (Figure 5'). These electronic, ionic or thermionic
          gravitator units may be grouped in any form productive of a
          desired force action or motion. One such form is the
          arrangement illustrated in Figure 7 where the particular
          gravitator units in question are indicated at L, disposed
          around a wheel or rotary motor similarly to the arrangement of
          the gravitator motor of cellular type shown in Figure 6, the
          difference being that in Figure 7, the electronic, ionic, or
          thermionic gravitator units are utilized. This motor may
          appropriately be designated as a gravitator motor of the
          electronic, ionic, or thermionic type, respectively. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The gravitator motors of
          Figure 6 and 7 may be supplied with the necessary electrical
          energy for the operation and resultant motion thereof from
          sources outside and independent of the motor itself. In such
          instances they constitute external or independently excited
          motors. On the other hand, the motors when capable of creating
          sufficient power to generate by any method whatsoever all the
          electrical energy required therein for the operation of said
          motors are distinguished by being internal or self-excited.
          Here, it will be understood that the energy created by the
          operation of the motor may at times be vastly in excess of the
          energy required to operate the motor. In some instances the
          ratio may even be as high as a million to one. Inasmuch as any
          suitable means for supplying the necessary electrical energy,
          and suitable conducting means for permitting the energy
          generated by the motor to exert the expected influence on the
          same may be readily supplied, it is now deemed necessary to
          illustrate the details herein. In said self-excited motors the
          energy necessary to overcome the friction or other resistance
          in the physical structure of the apparatus, and even to
          accelerate the motors against such resistance, is believed to
          be derived solely from the gravitational field or the energy
          of gravitation. Furthermore, said acceleration in the
          self-excited gravitator motor can be harnessed mechanically so
          as to produce usable energy or power, said usable energy or
          power, as aforesaid, being derived from or transferred by the
          apparatus solely from the energy of gravitation. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The gravitator motors function
          as a result of the mutual and unidirectional forces exerted by
          their charged electrodes. The direction of these forces and
          the resultant motion thereby produced are usually toward the
          positive electrode. This movement is practically linear. It is
          this primary action with which I deal. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">As has already been pointed
          out herein, there are two ways in which this primary action
          can accomplish mechanical work. First, by operating in a
          linear path as it does naturally, or second, by operating in a
          curved path. Since the circle is the most easily applied of
          all the geometric figures, it follows that the rotary form is
          the most important. While other forms may be built it has been
          considered necessary to explain and illustrate only the linear
          and rotary forms. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The linear form of cellular
          gravitator is illustrated in detail in Figures 8, 9 and 10. It
          is built up of a number of metallic plates alternated or
          staggered with sheets of insulating material (Figure 3). Each
          pair of plates so separated by insulation act as one
          gravitator cell, and each plate exhibits the desired force
          laterally. The potential is applied on the end plates and the
          potential is divided equally among the cells. Each metallic
          plate in the system possesses a force usually toward the
          positively charged terminus, and the system as a whole moves
          or tends to move in that direction. It is a linear motor, and
          the line of its action is parallel to the line of its
          electrodes. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">There are three general rules
          to follow in the construction of such motors. First, the
          insulating sheets should be as thin as possible and yet have a
          relatively high puncture voltage. It is advisable also to use
          paraffin-insulated insulators on account of their high
          specific resistance. Second, the potential difference between
          any tow metallic plates should be as high as possible and yet
          be safely under the minimum puncture voltage of the insulator.
          Third, there should, in most cases, be as many plates as
          possible in order that the saturation voltage of the system
          might be raised well above the highest limit upon which the
          motor is operated. Reference has previously been made to the
          fact that in the preferred embodiment of the invention herein
          disclosed the movement is toward the positive electrode.
          However, it will be clear that motion may be had in the
          reverse direction determined by what I have just termed
          "saturation voltage", by which is meant the efficiency peak or
          maximum of action for that particular type of motor; the
          theory, as I may describe it, being that as the voltage is
          increased the force or action increases to a maximum which
          represents the greatest action in a negative-to-positive
          direction. If the voltage were increased beyond that maximum
          the action would decrease to zero and thence to the
          positive-to-negative direction. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Referring more specifically to
          Figures 8, 9 and 10, red fiber end plates 1 act as supports
          and end insulators, and the first metallic plate 2 (for
          example aluminum) is connected electrically, through the fiber
          end plate, with the terminal 5. The second insulating sheet 3
          is composed, for example, of varnished cambric, sometimes
          known as "empire cloth". The relative size and arrangement of
          the metallic plate and insulating sheets are best seen in
          Figures 9 and 10. A paraffin filler H is placed between
          adjacent insulating sheets and around the edges of the
          metallic plates (Figure 10a) and 6 represents a thin paraffin
          coating over the whole motor proper. 7 and 8 indicate
          successive layers of "empire cloth" or similar material, and 9
          is a binding tape therefore. A thin film of a substance such
          as black spirit varnish 10 protects and insulates the entire
          outer surface. A phosphor bronze safety gap element 11 is
          connected electrically with the terminal (not shown) opposite
          to the terminal 5. A safety gap element corresponding with the
          element 11 is electrically connected with the terminal 5, but
          it has not been shown, in order better to illustrate interior
          parts. The purpose of the safety gaps is to limit the voltage
          imposed on the motor to the predetermined maximum and to
          prevent puncture. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The rotary motor (Figures 11,
          12 and 13) comprises broadly speaking, an assembly of a
          plurality of linear motors, fastened to or bent around the
          circumference of a wheel. In that case the wheel limits the
          action of the linear motors to a circle, and the wheel rotates
          in the manner of a fireworks pinwheel. The illustrations I
          have given are typical. The forms of Figur3s 6 and 7 have been
          defined. In Figure 11, the insulating end disk 1a has an
          opening 2a therethrough for an extension of the shaft 12. The
          disk 1a is secured to a suitable insulating motor shell, by
          fiber bolts or screws in any convenient manner, there being
          another of these disks at the opposite end of the shell, in
          the same manner as the opposite end plates 1 in Figure 8. The
          cells are built upon an insulating tube 11a disposed about the
          shaft-space 3a. Thick insulating wedges 4a separate the four
          linear motors illustrated. These thick insulating wedges,
          so-called, are substantially greater in body than the
          aggregate insulating sheets of the units. In some instances,
          however, dependent upon materials employed for the charged
          elements and the insulating members, this need not necessarily
          be the case. In each motor of this circular series of motors,
          there are the alternate sheets of insulation 5a associated
          with the alternate metallic plates 6a; paraffin fillers 71
          along the edges of the plates 6a and between the insulating
          sheets 5a being employed similarly to the use of paraffin in
          Figure 8. The rotary motor is encircled by metallic
          (preferably copper) collector rings 10a, which are connected
          with the end metallic plates of the separate linear motors at
          9a and 13 (Figure 12), one of these connections 9 being shown
          in detail where the insulating tube is cut away at 8 (Figure
          11). </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">It is unnecessary herein to
          illustrate a housing or bearings because any insulated housing
          and good ball bearings, conveniently supplied, will complete
          the motor. The potential is applied to the safety gap mounted
          on the housing and thence is conducted to the collector rings
          of the motor by means of sliding brushes. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">While I have in the foregoing
          Specification outlined, in connection with the broader aspects
          of my invention, certain forms and details, I desire it
          understood that specific details have been referred to for the
          purpose of imparting a full and clear understanding of the
          invention, and not for the purposes of limitation, because it
          should be apparent that many changes in construction and
          arrangement, and many embodiments of the invention, other than
          those illustrated, are possible without departing from the
          spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Having now particularly
          described and ascertained the nature of my said invention and
          in what manner the same is to be performed, I declare that
          what I clam is: </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(1) A method of producing
          force or motion, which comprises the step of aggregating the
          predominating gravitational lateral or linear forces of
          positive and negative charges which are so cooperatively
          related as to eliminate or practically eliminate the effect of
          similar and opposing forces which said charges exert. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(2) A method of producing
          force or motion, in which a mechanical or structural part is
          associated with at lest two electrodes or the like, of which
          the adjacent electrodes or the like have charges of differing
          characteristics, the resultant, predominating uni-directional
          gravitational force of said electrodes or the like being
          utilized to produce linear force or a motion of said part. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(3) A method according to
          Claim 1 or 2, in which the predominating force of the charges
          or electrodes is due to the normal gravitational field and the
          imposed electrical field. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(4) A method according to
          Claim 1, 2, or 3, in which the electrodes or other elements
          bearing the charges are mounted, preferably rigidly, on a body
          or support adapted to move or exert force in the general
          direction of alignment of the electrodes or other
          charge-bearing elements. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(5) A machine or apparatus for
          producing force or motion, which includes at least two
          electrodes or like element adapted to be differently charged,
          so relatively arranged that they produce a combined linear
          force or motion in the general direction of their alignment. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(6) A machine according to
          Claim 5, in which the electrodes are mounted, preferably
          rigidly, on a mechanical or structural part, whereby the
          predominating uni-directional force obtained from the
          electrodes or the like is adapted to move said part or to
          oppose forces tending to move it counter to the direction in
          which it would be moved by the action of the electrodes or the
          like. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(7) A machine according to
          Calim 5 or 6, in which the energy necessary for charging the
          electrodes of the like is obtained either from the electrodes
          themselves or from an independent source. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(8) A machine according to
          Claim 5, 6, or 7, whose force action or gravitational power
          depends in part on the gravitational field or energy of
          gravitation, which is controlled or influenced by the action
          of the electrodes or the like. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(9) A machine according to any
          of Claims 5 to 8, in the form of a motor including a
          gravitator cell or gravitator cellular body, substantially as
          described. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(10) A machine according to
          Claim 9, in which the gravitator cellular body or an assembly
          of the gravitator cells is mounted on a wheel-like support,
          whereby rotation of the latter may be effected, said cells
          being of electronic, ionic or thermionic type. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(11) A method of controlling
          or influencing the gravitational field or the energy of
          gravitation and for deriving energy or power therefrom
          comprising the use of at least two masses differently
          electrically charged, whereby the surrounding gravitational
          field is affected or distorted by the imposed electrical field
          surrounding said charged masses, resulting in a
          uni-directional force being exerted on the system of charged
          masses in the general direction of the alignment of the
          masses, which system when permitted to move in response to
          said force in the above mentioned direction derives and
          accumulates as the result of said movement usable energy or
          power from the energy of gravitation or the gravitational
          field which is so controlled, influenced, or distorted. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">(12) A method of and the
          machine or apparatus for producing force or motion by
          electrically controlling or influencing the gravitational
          field or energy of gravitation, substantially as hereinbefore
          described with reference to the accompanying drawings. </p>
