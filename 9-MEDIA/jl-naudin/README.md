# Serrano thruster

I think the thrust they got out of this was extremely low.

I think this is another case of not-understanding-their-own-invention precisely.

Like, I don't understand why there are 4 alternating polarity layers instead of just 2.

It is not explained. The patent links (both of them) don't work.
