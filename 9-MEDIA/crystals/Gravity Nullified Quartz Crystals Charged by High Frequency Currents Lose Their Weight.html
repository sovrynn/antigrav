</b><p>Although some remarkable achievements have been made with 
short-wave low power Transmitter, radio experts and amateurs have 
recently decided that short-wave transmission had reached its ultimate 
and that no vital improvement would be made in this time. </p>
<p>A short time ago, however, two young European experimenters working 
with ultra short-waves, have made a discovery that promises to be of 
primary importance to the scientific world.</p>
<p>The discovery was made about six weeks ago in a newly established 
central laboratory of the Nessartsaddin-Werke in Darredein, Poland, by 
Dr. Kowsky and Engineer Frost. </p>
<p>While experimenting with the constants of very short waves, carried 
on by means of quartz resonators, a piece of quartz which was used, 
suddenly showed a clearly altered appearance. It was easily seen that in
 the center of the crystal, especially when a constant temperature not 
exceeding ten degrees C. (50 degrees Fahrenheit) was maintained, milky 
cloudiness appeared which gradually developed to complete opacity. </p>
<p>The experiments of Dr.Meissner, of the Telefunken Co., along similar 
lines, according to which quartz crystals, subjected to high frequency 
currents clearly showed air currents which led to the construction of a 
little motor based on this principle. </p>
<p>A week of eager experimenting finally led Dr. Kowsky and Engineer 
Frost to the explanation of the phenomenon, and further experiments 
showed the unexpected possibilities for technical uses of the discovery.</p>
<p>Some statements must precede the explanation. It is known at least in
 part, that quartz and some other crystals of similar atomic nature, 
have the property when exposed to potential excitation in a definite 
direction, of stretching and contracting, and if one uses rapidly 
changing potentials, the crystals will change the electric waves into 
mechanical oscillations. </p>
<p>This <i>piezo- electric </i>effect, shown in Rochelle salt crystals 
by which they may be made into sound-producing devices such as loud 
speakers or reversibly into microphones, also shows the results in this 
direction. </p>
<p>This effect was clearly explained in August, 1925 Radio News and December, 1919 Electrical Experimenter. </p>
<p>These oscillations are extremely small, but have nevertheless their 
technical use in a quartz crystal wave-meter and in maintaining a 
constant wave length in radio transmitters.</p>

<b><i></i></b><i></i><p><i><b>This schematic diagram of the experiment 
is shown in this illustration. The high frequency oscillator has been 
omitted for clarity.</b></i> </p>
<p>By a special arrangements of the excitation of the crystal in various
 directions, it may be made to stretch or increase in length and will 
not return to its original size. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<b><i>Fig 3. This shows how the quartz crystal lost weight when
 subjected to the high frequency current. The original crystal was 
balanced on the scale.</i></b></p><b><i>
</i></b><p>It seems as if a dispersal of electrons from a molecule 
resulted, which as it is irreversible, changes the entire structure of 
the crystal, so that it cannot be restored to its former condition.</p>
<p>The stretching out, as we may term this strange property of the crystal, explains the reason for its transparency. </p>
<p>At the same time a change takes place in its specific gravity. 
Testing it on the balance showed that after connecting the crystal to 
the high tension current, the arm of the balance on which the crystal 
with the electrical connections tests rode into air.</p>
<b><i><p>The illustration, of Fig 3. shows this experiment.</p>
</i></b><p>This pointed the way for further investigation and the 
determination of how far the reduction of the specific gravity could be 
carried out. By the use of greater power, finally to the extent of 
several kilowatts and longer exposure to the action, it was found 
eventually that from a little crystal, 5 by 2 by 1.5 millimeters, a 
nontransparent white body measuring about ten centimeters on the side 
resulted, or increased about 20 times in length on any side (see Fig 4.)</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transformed crystal was so light that it carried the whole 
apparatus with itself upwards, along with the weight of twenty-five 
kilograms (55 lbs) suspended from it and floating freely in the air.</p>
<p>On exact measurement and calculation, which on account of the 
excellent apparatus in the Darredein laboratory could be readily carried
 out, it was found that the specific gravity was reduced to a greater 
amount than the change in volume would indicate,</p>
<p>Its weight had become practically negative.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that a beginning has been made toward overcoming gravitation.</p>
<p>It is to be noted, however, that the law of conservation of energy is absolutely unchanged.</p>
<p>The energy employed in treating the crystal, appears as the counter effect of gravitation.</p>
<p>Thus the riddle of gravitation is not fully solved as yet, and the 
progress of experiments will be followed further. It is, however, the 
first time that experimentation with gravitation, which hitherto has 
been beyond the pale of all such research, has become possible, and it 
seems as if there were a way discovered at last to explain the 
interrelations of gravity with electric and magnetic forces, which 
connection, long sought for, has never been demonstrated.</p>
