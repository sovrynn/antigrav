## Highlight

Avoid people working on magnets that spin. There are so many. Yes it might work but creating a particular 3d shape with fields is too physically challenging.

Like james corbett says, sensitive topics can only be found via the "magic words" for example chemtrails => stratospheric aerosol injection. Avoid the word antigravity, people do not mention this instead search for things like "anomalous thrust, unexpected force, transient mass fluctuations, weight reduction, modification of gravitational"

The biggest file repository you can get your hands on is the one collected by Jeremy Rys "alien scientist". He even trained an AI on the data set. Many entries are since removed from the internet. He has spent most of his life trying to answer the question you have. You can ask him for it, and if you struggle to get a response turn to falcon space maybe apec host Tim Ventura. 

Dozens of people have dedicated their lives to solving this puzzle. It will be near impossible for you to do so. From listening to many others and my own research I can predict where your research will end. If the method exists on the internet it will be vague enough to not be replicated (like not specifying frquency or material) or it will be spread across patents that seem unrelated and are missing words you might search for but combine to a method. It seems more than several people have found the answer bit disappear right after, but not death, its usually something else. The parts cost less than several grand to buy; anyone who purchases the correct materials immediately has someone show up at their door. The solution is known since some time between 1950 and 1980 and a group tries to keep it secret. The people keeping it secret likely believe they are saving humanity from destroying itself. 

For leads look for people working on this subject who suddenly stopped posting online about it. Ask apec community members for leads. Become an expert on tt brown and his connections starting with american alchemey doc on it. If someone says they solved it and are openly telling people how, they are lying or disinfo -- the real solution makes people go dark. Look into geometric energy corp with Sam Reid and Amy Eskridge's dad. Look into who attended the chapel hill antigrav conference in 1950s.

As far as science goes I only have vibes of the correct direction. Make a known quantum effect or anomoly macroscopic via macoscopic quntum coherence. Look into scalar fields. Look into quantum chiral anomolies. If something seems to require metamaterials there exists an easier way. The solution can likely be done at home with legal supplies. Look into the terahertz gap and investigate why this frequency is so hard to generate. Look into high dielectric materials. Look for scientists that publish on the above subjects and suddenly stop.

...

My prediction for your research is arriving at a similar place as many. A dozen promising dead ends, most of which are fake paths to throw people ofd the trail. If you make a breakthrough it will likely be piecing together works that seem unrelated. Lots of people came close then went dark, perhaps you can cross reference and find something new but people who have spent thousands of hours have failed.

I didnt save my research. Here are some more:

Find out why electrons tunneling through an overcharged capacitor produces thrust. Horizon drive is many capacitors stacked. Multiple labs confirmed then for the gold standard proof they sent a device on a spacex launch to prove it could change orbits using only electricity. The device was destroyed during launch (suspicious imo).

Find out how sal pais patents combine together. They are intentionally obfuscated. Wave guides reducing inertia.

There is this female chinese scientist I forget her name who seemingly made a breakthrough then went dark. 

The second law has what is formally called boundary conditions. See the professors who give presentations to Unlab on youtube.  Understanding the conditions under which the second law does not locally hold informs you of the arena to search in and will give you intuitions for when you find a canidate solution. 

Mark from falcon space knows the most regarding the dead ends. Ive heard of many but have forgotten names. Usually they are normal researchers publishing papers regularly who stop. This informs you of what is adjacent or prerequisite to to solution.

seek people who have created standing waves or require dielectric material. seek people who investigate quantum anomolies. Seek experimentalists who claim an effect but dont claim to know why it happens.

If the claimed solution does not openly address the common dismissals like ion wind or stick-slip, its likely false/fake.
