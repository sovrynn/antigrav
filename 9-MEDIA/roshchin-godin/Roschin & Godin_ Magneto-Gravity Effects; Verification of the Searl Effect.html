      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Introduction ~</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There has been a
          great interest in examining nonlinear effects in the system of
          rotating magnetic fields. Such effects have been observed in
          the device called Searl's generator or SEG (SEG, Searl Effect
          Generator) [1-4]. An SEG consists of a series of three rings
          and rollers that go around those rings. All parts of SEG are
          based on the Law of the Squares. The rollers revolve around
          the plates that form the rings, but they do not touch them.
          There's a primary north and south pole on the rollers and a
          primary&nbsp; north and south pole on the plates. Obviously
          you will have the north pole of the roller attracted to the
          south pole of the plate. The plate and the rollers have
          layered structure. The external layer - Titan, then Iron,
          Nylon and last internal layer was made from Neodymium. John
          R.R. Searl has supposed that the electrons are given off from
          the central element (which is neodymium), and they travel out
          through other elements.&nbsp; If nylon had not been put there,
          the SEG would act like a laser and one pulse would go out and
          it would stop, build up, and another pulse would go out. But,
          with the nylon being, nylon acts as a control gate, and that
          control gate gives you an even flow of&nbsp; electrons
          throughout the SEG [4]. In [4] it was shown that in the
          process of&nbsp; magnetization of the plate and rollers, the
          combination of constant and variable magnetic fields for
          creating a special wave (sine wave) pattern on a plate surface
          and rollers surface was used. The basic effects are the
          rollers selfrunning around a ring plate and reduction of
          weight up to occurrence of propulsion and flying up of all
          magnetic system. These effects come about because of a special
          geometry of experimental setup. It was shown that the work of
          the device in critical regime is accompanied by biological and
          real physical phenomena. Unfortunately except for the listed
          references we could not find other information where similar
          effects are be mentioned. In this paper we present the
          experimental device the results we have obtained. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The Description
            of the Experimental Installation ~</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The basic difficulty
          is in a choosing the materials and maintaining the necessary
          pattern imprinting on the plate and rollers surfaces. To
          simplify the technology we decided to use a one-ring design
          with one-ring plate (stator) and one-ring of rollers (rotor).
          It is obvious, that it was necessary to strengthen the rollers
          on a rotor by the bearings and balance the rollers well. In
          the suggested design the air bearings were used which provided
          the minimum losses due to friction. From the available
          description [1-4] it was not clear how it is possible to make
          and magnetize the stator with a diameter of about one meter.
          In order to make the stator from separate magnetized segments
          executed on the basis of rare earth magnets with the residual
          induction 1T; the segments were magnetized in a usual way by
          discharging capacitor battery through the coil. Afterwards the
          segments were assembled and glued together in a special
          iron&nbsp; armature, which reduced magnetic energy. To
          manufacture the stator 110 KGs of rare earth magnets were
          used, and to manufacture the rotor 115 KGs of that material
          was used. High-frequency field under magnetization was not
          applied. It was decided to replace an imprinting technology
          described in [1-4] with cross-magnetic inserts having a flux
          vector directed at 90 degrees to a vector of basic
          magnetization of a stator and rollers of a rotor. For these
          cross inserts the modified rare earth magnets with a residual
          magnetization of 1,2 T and coercive force a little bit greater
          than in a base material was used. In Figure 1 and Figure 2 the
          joint arrangement of stator 1, elements of a rotor - rollers 2
          and a way of their mutual gearing by means of cross magnetic
          inserts 19, are shown. Between the stator and roller surfaces
          the air gap <i>d</i> of 1 mm is left. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">No layered structure
          was used except a continuous copper foil of 0.8 mm thickness
          which wrapped up the stator and rollers. This foil has the
          direct electrical contact to magnets of a stator and rollers.
          Distance between inserts in the rollers is equal to distance
          between inserts on the stator. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The ratio of
          parameters of the stator 1 and the rotor 2 in Figure 2 is
          chosen so that the relation of stator diameter&nbsp; D and
          roller diameter d is an integer equal to or greater then 12.
          Choosing such a ratio allows us to achieve a magnetic spin
          wave resonant mode between elements of a working body of the
          device. </font></p>

          of moving vertical on three supports. The value of
          displacement was measured by the induction meter of
          displacement 14; thus the change of the platform weight at
          once has been defined during the experiment in real time.
          Gross weight of the platform with magnetic system in the
          initial condition was 350 KGs. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The stator 1 was
          mounted motionlessly, and the rollers 2 were assembled on a
          mobile common separator 3, connected with the basic shaft 4 of
          the device. Through this shaft the rotary moment was
          transferred. The basic shaft by the means of friction muff 5
          was connected to the electrodynamics generator 7 and starting
          engine 6, which accelerated the converter up to a mode of
          self-sustained rotation. Along a rotor the electromagnetic
          inductors 8 with open cores 9 were located. The magnetic
          rollers 2 crossed the open cores of inductors and closed the
          magnetic flux through electromagnetic inductors 8, and induced
          emf in them, which acted directly on an active load 10 (a set
          of incandescent lamps with total power 1 kW). The
          electromagnetic inductors 8 were equipped with an electrical
          drive 11 and had an opportunity to smoothly move on supports
          12. To study the influence of the external high voltage on the
          characteristics of the converter the system of radial
          electrical polarization was&nbsp; mounted. On periphery of the
          rotor ring electrodes 13 were set between the electromagnetic
          inductors 8 having with the rollers 2 air gap of 10 mm. The
          electrodes are connected to a high-voltage source; the
          positive potential was connected to the stator, and the
          negative to the polarization electrodes. The voltage was
          adjusted in a range of 0-20 kV. In experiments the constant
          value of 20 kV was used. In case of emergency braking,
          friction disk from the ordinary car braking system was mounted
          on a basic shaft of the rotor. The electrodynamics generator 7
          was connected to active load through a set of switches
          ensuring step connection of the load from 1 kW to 10 kW. The
          converter under going testing had in its inner structure the
          oil friction generator of thermal energy 15, intended for
          taping a superfluous power (more than 10 kW) into the
          thermo-exchange contour. But since the real output power of
          the converter in experiment has not exceeded 7 kW, the oil
          friction thermal generator was not used. The complete
          stabilization of revolutions of the rotor was carried out by
          electromagnetic inductors connected to an additional load,
          which was set of incandescent lamps with total power 1 kW. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Experimental
            Results ~</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The magnetic-gravity
          converter was built in a laboratory&nbsp; room on three
          concrete supports at a ground level. The ceiling height the
          lab room was&nbsp; 3 meters. Besides the presence of the
          iron-concrete ceiling, in immediate proximity from the
          magnetic system there was a generator and electric motor,
          which contained some tens KGs of iron and could potentially
          deform the field's pattern. The device was started by the
          electric motor, which accelerated the rotation of the rotor.
          The revolutions were smoothly increased up to the moment the
          ammeter included in a circuit of the electric motor started to
          show zero or lower value of a consumed current or even a
          presence of the back current. The presence of the back current
          is detected at approx. 550 rpm. The magnetic moving sensor 14
          starts to detect the change in weight of the whole
          installation at 200 rpm. Afterwards the electric motor is
          completely disconnected by the electromagnetic muff and the
          ordinary electrodynamics generator is connected to the basic
          shaft of the device through the same muff. The rotor of the
          converter continues to self-accelerate and with the approach
          to the critical mode of 550 rpm, the weight of the device
          quickly changes. In addition to the change speed of rotation
          the weight depend of the power, removed into active load, (the
          set of ten ordinary electrical water heaters of 1 kW was used)
          and of the applied polarizing voltage, as well. At the maximum
          output power equal to 6-7 kW the change of weight G of the
          whole platform (total weight is about 350 KGs), reaches 35 %
          of the weight in an initial condition G?. A load of more than
          7 kW results in a gradual decrease of revolutions and exit
          from the mode of self-generation with the subsequent complete
          stop of the rotor. The weight of a platform can be controlled
          by applying of a high voltage to cellular ring electrodes
          located at a distance of 10 mm from external surfaces of the
          rollers. Under the high 20 kV voltage (electrodes negative
          pole) the increase of taped power in circuit of the basic
          generator more than 6 kW does not influence G while the
          revolutions per min is not decreased to 400 rpm. "Tightening"
          of this effect is observed as well as the effect of hysteresis
          on G (a kind of "residual induction"). The experimental
          diagrams given on Fig.4 illustrate the modes of the converter
          operations. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The effect of a
          local change of the platform weight is convertible relative to
          the direction of rotor turning, and has the same hysteresis.
          At clockwise rotation the critical mode comes in the area of
          550 rpm and the propulsion force against the direction of
          gravitation vector is created, by analogy, at
          counter-clockwise rotation the critical mode comes the in area
          of 600 rpm and the propulsion on the direction of gravitation
          vector is created. The difference in approach to a critical
          mode of 50-60 rpm was observed. It is necessary to mention
          that the most interesting region lies above the critical area
          of 550 rpm, but due to of a number of circumstances the
          implementation of such research was not possible. Other
          interesting effects include the work of the converter in the
          dark room when corona discharges are observed around the
          converter's rotor as a blue-pink glowing luminescence and a
          characteristic ozone&nbsp; smell. The cloud of ionization
          covers the area of a stator and a rotor and has accordingly
          toroidal form. On the background of luminescence glowing on
          rollers' surfaces we distinguished wave picture. A number of
          more vigorous strips of discharges around the rollers were
          observed. These discharges were of the white - yellow colour
          is, but the characteristic for the arc discharges sound was
          not audible.&nbsp; One more effect previously not mentioned
          was observed i.e. the vertical magnetic&nbsp; "walls" around
          the installation. We noticed and measured the abnormal
          permanent magnetic field around the converter in the radius of
          15 meters. The zones of an&nbsp; increased intensity of a
          magnetic flux 0,05T located concentrically from the centre of
          the installation were detected. The direction of&nbsp;
          magnetic field vector in these walls coincided with the
          direction of rollers' field vector. The structure of these
          zones reminded circles on water from the thrown stone. Between
          these zones a portable magnetometer, which used the Hall's
          sensor as a sensitive element, did not register abnormal
          magnetic fields. The layers of an increased intensity are
          distributed practically without losses up to a distance of
          about 15 meters from the centre of the converter and quickly
          decrease at the border of this zone. The thickness of each
          layer is about 5 - 8 cm. The border of each layer has sharp
          shape, the distance between layers is about 50 - 60 cm and it
          slightly accrues when moving from the centre of the converter.
          The steady picture of this field was observed as well at a
          height of 6 m above the installation (on the second floor
          above the lab.). Above the second floor the measurements were
          not carried out. The abnormal fall of the temperature in
          direct affinity from the converter was also found. While the
          common temperature background in laboratory was + 22? (2?) the
          fall of temperature equal to 6-8? was noticed. The same
          phenomenon was observed in vertical magnetic walls as well as.
          The measurements of temperature inside the magnetic walls were
          carried out by the ordinary alcohol thermometer with inertia
          of indication about 1,5 min. In the magnetic walls the
          temperature changes can be distinctly observed even by hand.
          The hand when placed into this magnetic wall feels real cold
          at once. The similar picture was observed at the height above
          installation, i.e. on the second floor of the laboratory as
          well as despite the ferro-concrete blocking of ceiling. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All the results we
          obtained are extremely unusual and require some theoretical
          explanation. Unfortunately the interpretation of results
          within the framework of the conventional physical theory
          cannot explain all the observed phenomena and first of all the
          change of weight. The change of weight is possible to
          interpret as a local change of gravity force or as an
          occurrence of propulsion force by repelling from its own
          field. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Direct experiment,
          confirming a presence of draft force was not performed, but in
          any case both interpretations of the weight change do not
          correspond to the modern physical paradigm and demand
          reconsideration of the standard theory of gravitation or
          criticism of the second law of Newton, both of which are only
          possible if we take into consideration the now-advert physical
          media ether as understood by&nbsp;&nbsp; Faraday-Maxwell-Mie.
          From the modern physics position electrization and
          luminescence of the converter's magnetic system in the near
          zone is not completely clear. The phenomenon of the magnetic
          and thermal "walls" may be connected with&nbsp; Alphen's
          magnetic-sound waves raised in near zone in magnetized plasma
          induced by a variable magnetic field of a rotating rotor [5].

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the present time
          we can not give an exact description of the interactions
          mechanism with environment and transformation of energy, but
          it is completely obvious, that without the use of the concept
          of physical media --- the ether in a sense of
          Faraday-Maxwell-Mie we are completely unable to give
          physically substantial theory of these phenomena. In
          conclusion, we emphasize that the issues of the biological
          influence effects and especially of the variations of real
          time stream effects, which must be taking place in an
          operative zone of the converter, were not considered at
          all.&nbsp; These issues are extremely important and absolutely
          unexplored; though there are some mentions of J.R.R.Searl
          about healing action of the SEG's radiation. Our own
          experience allows to make only cautious assumption that the
          short-term stay (dozen minutes) in a working zone of the
          converter with the fixed output power of 6 kW remains for the
          people without observed consequences. The present paper is
          only a&nbsp; beginning. </font></p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is demonstrated
          that a magnetic system based on rare-earth magnets is capable
          of converting various forms of the energy, provided that a
          certain critical operating regime is set up. As the critical
          regime is attained, the experimental setup becomes
          energetically fully autonomous. This is accompanied by local
          variations in the total structure weight, a decrease in the
          surrounding air temperature, and the formation of concentric
          "magnetic walls" at a distance of up to 15 meters from the
          experimental setup. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Introduction ~</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have
          experimentally studied the physical effects in a system based
          on rotating permanent magnets (1). Below we describe the
          technology of manufacture, assembly, and the results of
          testing this experimental setup, which is referred to as the
          converter. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Technological
            Description ~</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The converter
          comprises an immobile stator and a rotor moving around the
          stator and carrying fixed magnetic rollers. The magnetic
          system of the working body of the converter has a diameter of
          about 1 meter. The stator and magnetic rollers were
          manufactured from separate magnetized segments made of
          rare-earth magnets (REMs) with a residual magnetization of
          0.85 T, a coercive force of [Hc] ~ 600 kA/m, and a specific
          magnetic energy of [W] ~ 150 K/m3. The segments were
          magnetized by a conventional method based on a discharge of a
          capacitor bank through an inductor coil. Then the magnetized
          segments were assembled and glued together in a special
          mounting stage, which provided for the necessary tolerance in
          positioning the segments and for the removal of magnetic
          energy. Using this mounting stage, it was possible to glue the
          elements into the common unit. The stable incorporated REMs
          with a total weight of 110 kg and the rollers contained 115 kg
          of the same REM material. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The magnetic system
          elements were assembled into a single structure on a special
          platform made of non-magnetic structural alloys. The platform
          construction was provided with springs and shock absorbers and
          allowed the converter setup to move in the vertical direction
          on three sides. The motion was monitored by an inductive
          transducer. Which allowed changes ion the platform weight to
          be determined in the course of the experiment. The total
          weight of the platform with the magnetic system in the initial
          state was 350 kg. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Description of
            the Observed Effects ~</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The converter was
          installed in a 2.5-meter high laboratory room using three
          concrete supports on a ground level. In addition to the
          ordinary steel-reinforced concrete ceiling blocks, the
          converter equipment featured a usual electrodynamic generator
          and an electric motor, with a total iron weight of several
          tens of kilograms (only these parts could, in principle,
          introduce distortions into the electromagnetic field pattern
          observed). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The converter was
          set to operate by over-speeding the rotor with the aid of the
          electric motor. The motor speed was gradually increased until
          the ammeter connected in the motor circuit showed zero
          consumed current and the current direction reversal. This
          state corresponded to a rotor speed of approximately 550 rpm,
          but the motion transducer began to indicate a change in the
          platform weight already at 200 rpm. Then the electric motor
          was disconnected using an electromagnetic overrunning clutch,
          and a usual electrodynamic generator was connected instead to
          the main shaft of the converter via another electromagnetic
          clutch. On attaining the critical regime (~550 rpm), the rotor
          exhibited a sharp increase in the rotation speed; this was
          accompanied by a slow-down in the rate of the current weight
          reduction. At this instant, the first 1 kW load was connected
          to the system. Immediately upon this connection, the rotation
          speed began to decrease, while the Delta G value kept
          increasing, and so on as depicted in the figure. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A diagram
          illustrating various operation regimes of the
          magnetogravitational converter showing (I) load power (kW) and
          system weight variation; (II) 7-kW load (high voltage off);
          (III) 7-kW load (high voltage on); (IV) supercritical regime;
          (V) subcritical regime (1, high voltage off; 2, high voltage
          on). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The system weight
          variation depend both on the power consumed by the active load
          (the load consisted of 10 ordinary 1-kW heating elements) and
          on the polarization voltage applied. For a maximum consumed
          power (7 kW), a change in the total platform weight reached
          35% of the initial value in the immobile state (350 kg), which
          corresponded to 50% of the pure weight of the working body of
          the converter. An increase in the load power above 7 kW led to
          a gradual decrease in the rotor speed and, eventually, to the
          system going out of the self-generation regime and the rotor
          speed decreasing until the full stop. The platform weight
          could be controlled by applying a high-voltage signal to the
          cellular ring electrodes situated 10 mm above the external
          roller surface. Upon applying a 20 kV signal (negative
          polarity on the electrodes), an increase in the load power
          consumption above 6 kW did not affect the Delta G value even
          when the rotor speed decreased down to 400 rpm. This was
          equivalent to "prolongation" of the effect and was accompanied
          by phenomena of the remnant induction" type with respect to
          Delta G. The converter operation in various experimental
          regimes is illustrated in the figure. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The effect of the
          system weight variation is reversible with respect to the
          direction of rotor motion and exhibits certain hysteresis. For
          the clockwise rotation, the critical regime is observed in the
          region of 550 rpm and is accompanied by development of the
          force acting against the gravity vector. For the
          counter-clockwise rotation, the onset of the critical regime
          is observed at approximately 600 rpm and the extra force
          coincides in direction with the gravity vector. The onset of
          the critical regime exhibited a scatter within 50-60 rpm. It
          should be noted that, probably, some other critical resonance
          regimes may exist, which correspond to higher rotor speeds and
          markedly greater useful load levels. Proceeding from the
          general theoretical consideration, the output mechanical
          energy must nonlinearly depend on the internal parameters of
          the converter magnetic system and the rotor speed, so that the
          observed effects are likely to be far from optimum.
          Establishing of the maximum output power maximum weight
          variation, and the converter energy resource is of
          considerable theoretical and practical interest. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Besides the
          phenomena described above, a number of other interesting
          effects were observed in the system studied. In particular,
          the converter operation in the dark is accompanied by a corona
          discharge with a pink-blue light emission and by the
          production of ozone. The ionization cloud is formed around the
          stator and rotor, acquiring a toroidal shape. The general
          corona discharge background is superimposed with a wavy
          pattern corresponding to the surface of the rollers: the zones
          of increased emission intensity are distributed along the
          roller height in a manner similar to that observed for the
          high-voltage microwave induction energy storage in the
          pre-breakdown state. These zones appeared yellowish-white, but
          the emission was not accompanied by sounds characteristic of
          the arc discharge. Nor did we observe any visible erosive
          damage on the stator and rotor surfaces. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One more effect,
          which was never reported previously, is the appearance of
          vertical "magnetic walls" surrounding the setup. We have
          detected and measured an anomalous constant magnetic field
          around the converter. The measurements revealed zones of
          increased magnetic strength on the order of 0.05 T arranged
          coaxially relative to the system center. The direction of the
          magnetic field vector on the "walls" coincides with that in
          the rollers. The structure of these magnetic zones resembles
          the pattern of circular waves on the water surface. No
          anomalous field is detected by a mobile magnetometer,
          employing the Hall effect transducer, in the area between
          zones. The layers of increased magnetic field strength are
          propagating with virtually no attenuation to a distance of 15
          meters from the converter center and then rapidly decayed at
          the boundary of this 15-meter area. Each layer zone is 5-8 cm
          thick and exhibits sharp boundaries. The layers are spaced by
          50-60 cm, the spacing slightly increasing with the distance
          from the converter center. A stable pattern was also observed
          at&nbsp; a height of 5 meters above the setup (the
          measurements were conducted in a 2nd floor room above the
          laboratory; no tests were conducted on a still higher level).
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another interesting
          phenomenon consists in an anomalous temperature drop in the
          immediate vicinity of the converter. At a general room
          temperature level in the laboratory (+22 +-2 C), the
          temperature at the converter surface was 6-8 C lower. Similar
          temperature variations were detected in the vertical magnetic
          "walls". The temperature changes in the walls were detected by
          an ordinary alcohol thermometer with a reading set time of 1.5
          minutes. The temperature variations in the magnetic "walls"
          can even be sensed by the human body: a hand placed inside the
          "wall" immediately feels cold. The same pattern was observed
          at a height of 5 meters above the setup in a 2nd floor room
          above the laboratory (despite the steel-reinforced concrete
          blocks separating the rooms). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Discussion of
            Results ~</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All the experimental
          results described above are very unusual and need some
          theoretical rationalization. Unfortunately, attempts at
          interpreting the obtained results within the framework of the
          existing physical theories showed that no one of these models
          can explain the whole set of experimental data. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recently, Dyatlov
          (2) attempted to combine the concepts of electricity and
          gravity by introducing the so-called electronavigation and
          magnetic-spin coefficients into the Heaviside gravity
          equations and the Maxwell field equations. This provides for a
          relationship between the gravitational and electrical
          components, as well as between the magnetic and rotational
          components in a given medium. The assumptions are built around
          a special model of inhomogenous physical vacuum, called the
          vacuum domain model (2). It is suggested that the extra
          relationships are absent outside the vacuum domain. Although
          it is difficult to imagine a long-living vacuum domain, the
          proposed model provides for a satisfactory explanation (at
          least on a qualitative phenomenological level) for the
          appearance of emission, the system weight variations, and the
          conversion of energy taken from the surrounding medium into
          the rotational mechanical moment of the rollers.
          Unfortunately, the theory cannot provide a physical pattern of
          the observed phenomena. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Conclusion ~</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At present, the work
          on a developed variant of the converter are in progress at the
          Glushko "NPE Energomash" company (Moscow). This setup would
          allow a deeper insight into the physics of observed phenomena.
          Another aim is the creation of commercial samples for various
          practical applications. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">FIELD OF THE
          INVENTION </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This invention
          relates generally to the field of direct current electrical
          motors and generators that operate without the need for
          commutation and/or rectification, and more particularly to
          multi-rotor homopolar machines which derive their emf
          (electromotive force) from co-rotational magnets and metallic
          disk embodiment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">BACKGROUND </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Back in 1831,
          Michael Faraday discovered that a cylindrical magnet suspended
          by a string and touching a mercury bath at the bottom could
          generate electricity while spinning along its axis if a second
          electrical contact was made at the periphery of the midpoint
          of the magnet. His experiment was a one-piece homopolar
          machine since the magnet and conductor were joined together.
          Such Faraday generators have also been called acyclic,
          unipolar or homopolar generators because no commutation or
          alternating of the magnetic poles is necessary for this
          machine in order to generate electricity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The type of
          electrical output is most often direct current (DC) unless
          specific means are designed to provide an interruption of
          radial conduction and thus simulate alternating current (AC).
          Historically, DC was championed by Thomas Edison during the
          early part of the 20th century while at the same time AC was
          championed by Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse. In the
          future, DC will be coming back into style with the emergence
          of ambient temperature superconductive cables. Therefore,
          highly efficient homopolar generators will be in demand to
          meet the future market demand for DC electricity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Homopolar generators
          usually have a single disk or drum rotating in a stationary
          magnetic field with sliding contacts. The sliding contacts
          often present high resistance however. The construction and
          operation of homopolar machines for electric propulsion of
          marine vessels or railguns for example is already well known.
          Such machines include motors and generators wherein electrical
          current flows through a conductor situated in a magnetic field
          during rotation of the machine rotor. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the case of a
          homopolar motor, the current will develop a J.times.B force
          perpendicular to the direction of its flow through the
          conductor and that of the magnetic field. In the case of a
          homopolar generator, a voltage dependent on the rotational
          speed, magnetic field, and radius, is induced in a conductor
          moving within the magnetic field. When current is drawn from
          the homopolar generator, it also develops a J.times.B force
          for the same reason as with the motor but is referred to as
          back torque or armature reaction. General reference
          information including basic principles used to reduce back
          torque can be found in The Homopolar Handbook by Thomas Valone
          (ISBN 0-9641070-1-5). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The prior art rarely
          includes a one-piece homopolar machines that rotate the magnet
          with the disk. Even more unknown is the concept of rolling
          contacts. Eliminating sliding contacts is shown in the
          "Planetary Homopolar Generator," IBM Technical Disklosure
          Bulletin, Vol. 17, No. 6, p. 1786-87, November, 1974, H. D.
          Varadarajan. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Using a conducting
          belt or rolling contacts to gather current from a magnetic
          field flux cutting rotor, there is an annular magnetic field
          through which the rotor executes a planetary motion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The large stresses
          resulting from the centrifugal force of the massive,
          unbalanced planetary rotor is a distinct disadvantage,
          prohibiting high speed operation. Thus, only a low rate of
          rotation is possible with the IBM design. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The "Direct Current
          Homopolar Machine" U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,618 to Hathaway
          demonstrates an analogous concept of relative motion between
          conductive orbiting shaft and a stationary disk-shaped
          magnetized armature. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, the design
          is a bit cumbersome to be practical. Science Applications
          International Corporation claims a conductive belt, dual disk
          "Homopolar Motor-Generator" in U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,232 to Reed
          that apparently reinvents the "Dynamo Electric Machine" of
          U.S. Pat. No. 406,968 patented by none other than Nikola Tesla
          in 1889 that also has two unipolar magnetized rotors connected
          by a conductive belt. The belted dual unipolar machines solve
          one of the problems that plague the field by offering two
          sliding contacts at the low speed surface on the axle.
          However, the present invention requires only one sliding
          contact on the axle. These conductive belt machines also
          demonstrate, in principle, the concept of a multi-rotor,
          planetary design, by the process of coordinate transformation,
          since relative motion is the key to the operation of a
          homopolar generator. The concept of rolling contact is
          demonstrated with the Dalen "Dynamo Electric Machine" U.S.
          Pat. No. 645,943, where two disks are turning in opposite
          directions while in contact with each other at their
          periphery. However, the axle of each disk must remain fixed in
          place whereas each axle is in orbiting motion in the present
          invention. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Homopolar machines
          can reversibly function as motors as well, such as flywheels,
          and used as energy storage devices. First used in
          transportation applications in the 1950's, flywheel powered
          buses were designed to have the flywheel accelerated at every
          stop. Composite rotors currently have been developed which can
          spin at very high revolutions (100,000 revolutions per
          second); and the speed is limited by the tensile strength of
          the rim of the rotor. By using a multi-rotor design, the
          centrifugal forces of a large disk can be greatly reduced and
          still maintain high-energy storage or production. By using
          magnetic bearings, the friction on the axis of the rotor can
          be reduced sufficiently so that such rotors can maintain most
          of the energy for several days. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The IBM Varadarajan
          planetary rotor is unbalanced and has a low rate of magnetic
          flux cutting due to its annular magnetic field design. The
          Hathaway direct current machine has a lot of unbalanced
          conductive material orbiting the central magnetized disk which
          limits the rotational speed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The conductive belt
          designs can be subject to oxidation and slippage, even
          requiring a toothed timing belt on each axle as well. With
          most disk models of homopolar generators, as opposed to drum
          designs, sliding contacts are the single most important
          contribution of resistance inhibiting the power output of the
          machine. Internal resistance is the only limit to the output
          capability of a homopolar generator and it is important to
          reduce all sources of internal resistance to obtain maximum
          power output for a given input torque. Rather than use high
          resistance carbon brushes, medium resistance silver-graphite
          brushes or dangerous conductive liquids such as mercury, low
          temperature solder, or sodium-potassium, there is a need to
          eliminate frictional sliding contact at the high speed
          periphery of the magnetized rotor completely. Furthermore,
          rather than maintaining two sliding contacts which contribute
          friction and resistance, even in the rolling and belted
          designs, there is a need to cut the number in half to only one
          high current sliding contact. The present invention satisfies
          both of these needs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">SUMMARY </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The present
          invention derives direct current electricity by co-rotating a
          plurality of magnets and a metallic disk. It comprises an
          improved homopolar machine with dynamically balancing, axially
          parallel, cylindrical, electrically conductive magnets
          arranged circumferentially around the vertical axis of central
          stator ring. Such a design can be referred to as distributed
          generation since each magnet rotor generates only a fraction
          of the current that is transmitted through the machine. Thus,
          the conductive bearings contacting the center of each end of
          the magnet rotors may carry only one tenth or less of the
          total current. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The multi-rotor
          orbiting homopolar also does not include sliding contacts at
          each magnetized rotor rim but instead utilizes a suitable
          rolling means attached separately to magnets and also to the
          stator ring for intimately contacting and engaging non-slip
          rolling between magnets and stator as they orbit around the
          stator. The magnetized rotors maintain rotational synchronism
          and equal relative position to each other with a bearing means
          rotatably securing the top and bottom end of each magnet to a
          corresponding electrically conductive circular endplate. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The electrical
          energy is extracted, or input if used as a motor, through
          contacts on the conductive stator and at the machine's
          electrically conductive axle located in the center of the
          machine while rigidly attached to the top circular endplate
          that rotates with all of the individually magnetized rotors.
          The only single, high current, moving contact that is required
          is an electrically conductive thrust bearing that supports the
          central axle. An insulating thrust bearing meanwhile separates
          the axle from the center of bottom circular endplate. The
          stator, which is of course stationary, accomplishes the second
          contact means through a standard electrical connection with no
          need for any relative motion sliding contact. The stator may
          be optionally magnetized in the opposite direction to the
          magnetized rotors in order to increase the coercive force or
          magnetic flux density. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          OF THE BEST MODE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As shown in the
          drawings wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout
          the several views, there is generally disclosed in FIG. 1 is a
          state of the prior art. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Detailed
          descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein.
          It is to be understood, however, that the present invention
          may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details
          disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but
          rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis
          for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present
          invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system,
          structure or manner. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Turning first to
          FIG. 2 there is shown a perspective cutaway view of a portion
          of one embodiment of the present invention showing one of a
          multitude of rotors that are axially magnetized (B). This
          multitude mounted in parallel comprise the multi-rotor
          homopolar machine in close contact with a ring shaped stator
          that may be optionally magnetized in the direction opposite to
          the magnetic fields of the rotors. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Each rotor 20 has
          its own axle 21 which is circumferentially mounted vertically,
          arranged and dynamically balanced around a central vertical
          axis, on an electrically conductive but low permeability axle
          rod 21 made of copper, brass or bronze, that may penetrate the
          center of the entire magnetized rotor and rotatably attach to
          top and bottom bearing 33 on circular endplates 31, 32 shown
          in FIG. 3. In operation, the rotors orbit around the circular
          stator ring, which may or may not also be magnetized. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The invention is
          more completely shown in the elevational view of FIG. 3 with
          several rotors 20 rotatably attached to the top circular
          endplate 31 and bottom circular endplate 32 by electrically
          conductive bearings 33. The top endplate 31 is rigidly
          attached to the central axle 34 supporting the orbiting
          multi-rotor homopolar generator assembly. The hollow circular
          design of the stationary ring stator 23 is also visible in
          FIG. 3, which can be optionally magnetized to increase
          performance output. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom circular
          endplate 32 has a large hole in the center, more completely
          seen in FIG. 4, that allows inner attachment to insulating
          bearing 44 which optimally can be a non-contacting, low
          friction magnetic bearing since the weight of the rotor
          assembly is carried by the electrically conductive thrust
          bearing 41. The bottom endplate 32 is thus isolated
          electrically from the stationary Inner cylinder 43 that is the
          inner core of the stator. Inner circular assembly plates 49 of
          equal size and shape, that preferably are electrically
          conductive, rigidly attach the inner cylinder 43 to the stator
          ring 23. In accordance with the present invention, FIG. 4
          shows the side cross sectional view edge on with a cutaway so
          that the central axle 34 and hollow inner cylinder design 43
          is visible. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The insulating
          bearings 42 separate the central axle 34 from the inner
          cylinder 43. Both bearings 42 and 44 electrically maintain the
          separation of polarity of the electromotive force (emf)
          voltage of each rotor. The positive or negative polarity of
          the conductors depends of course on the rotation direction of
          the rotor magnets. One conductor 45 is electrically emerging
          from the stator assembly and ultimately emanates from the
          outer edge of each rotor 20 with the homopolar effect
          conducting the generated electricity through the rolling means
          47 and 48. The opposite polarity conductor 46 is electrically
          emanating from the center axle 21 of each rotor 20 is
          connected to the electrically conductive thrust bearing 41. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In accordance with
          an important function of the present invention, there is shown
          in FIG. 4 one embodiment of an intimately contacting and
          engaging nonslip rolling means 47 and 48. As is well-known in
          the industry where good traction with a high coefficient of
          friction (1.6 or better) but sufficiently low electrical
          resistance is desired between two surfaces, an adherent
          coating of copper can be used on both facing surfaces of the
          stator 23 and rotor 20. For the copper coating,
          electro-deposition can be used or flame spraying of copper on
          the rotor and stator outer surfaces. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another embodiment
          of rolling means 47 and 48 utilizes a geared electromechanical
          rotary joint developed by NASA Goddard Space Center (NASA Tech
          Briefs, December, 1994) which offers the advantage of a
          springy, low noise planetary gear contacting a stator ring
          gear. It was designed by NASA to overcome the disadvantages of
          sliding contacts and to ensure high traction desired for
          rolling electrical contacts. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The springy gears
          are made from beryllium copper which is a self-cleaning
          material with, in one embodiment, an average diameter of 6.35
          mm with any reasonable number of teeth. Another concept to
          creating a rolling contact utilizes a magnetic sprocket design
          with small rare earth (samarium cobalt for example) magnets
          embedded perpendicularly in the surfaces of the stator ring
          and rotor magnets. The magnetic sprocket thus utilizes equally
          spaced magnets mounted normal to the axes of the stator and
          rotor. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To demonstrate an
          important feature of the invention, there is shown in FIG. 5 a
          plan view from the top of the balanced distribution of the
          rotors 20 around the stator assembly 43 with the outer stator
          ring 23 that are equally spaced and preferably dynamically
          balanced so the centrifugal forces are equal and opposite. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Theory of
            Operation ~</i></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The main principle
          of operation is based on the fact that rotating cylindrical
          magnets creates a homopolar emf generation from Faraday's Law
          and the Lorentz Force. Physically, a rotating, non-inertial
          reference frame configuration can only be analyzed correctly
          with Einstein's general theory of relativity, utilizing a
          Thirring metric. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Particularly, where
          rotating cylindrical magnets and disk are synchronized and
          made co-rotational, such a co-rotational configuration makes
          the generator one piece like the earth's magnetic field
          itself. As the inventors explored this correspondence more
          closely, it was learned that the earth's molten, electrically
          conductive iron core also includes not one but several
          vortices in a coaxial circular arrangement. The inventors
          stumbled upon this concept while investigating the field
          rotation paradox and found that an orbiting, multi-rotor
          homopolar generator assembly would be analogous to the earth's
          electrically conductive, multi-vortex, magnetic, molten iron
          core. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The field rotation
          paradox can be easily resolved by an amateur DIY (Do It
          Yourself ) scientist by comparing the interception of a linear
          magnetic field vs. a rotating magnetic field. In the former
          configuration the meter gives the same reading whether the
          magnet is moved with respect to a pickup coil of wire or vice
          versa but in the latter configuration the meter reading is
          seen only when the disk is moved with respect to rotary
          magnetic field of cylindrical magnet but not when the magnet
          is moved with respect to the disk. The former is consistent
          with special relativity while the latter is relying on general
          relativity. Both are loosely termed "relativistic." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Assembly and Use
            ~</i></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The manufacturing,
          assembly and use of this invention is very simple even
          intuitive. The system of this invention can be readily
          assembled from the teaching provided in this disclosure by

        The Morningstar Energy Box (Tuesday, March 15, 4:30 PM)
        SPESIF-COFE4 Presentation. 2011<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        SPESIF-COFE 4 Abstract. The Morningstar Energy Box is a
        derivative of a Searl device modified in a similar fashion used
        by the Russian Scientists Godin and Roschin. These devices use
        laminated rollers and a main ring made of different materials
        used to enhance electrical and magnetic properties. Where the
        Searl device uses rollers to move around a main ring, the
        Russian device kinematically constrains these rollers within a
        mechanical cage. The operational theory for the Energy Box uses
        rotating electromagnetic fields to create gravitational effects
        and is different from those theories outlined by either Searl or
        the Russians. A prototype device is currently under test and
        unfortunately self-accelerated motion has yet to be obtained.
        The Russians have made several serious claims that their device
        produced self-acceleration to generate electricity, created a
        relatively large weight loss, generated discrete walls of
        magnetism far from the device and that a temperature drop exists
        when the device loses weight. To date, no one has validated
        these outrageous claims. However, we have found similar
        phenomenon regarding temperature loss and the discrete magnetic
        walls to occur during tests of the Energy Box and have
        correlated the temperature drop that the Godin &amp; Roschin
        device produces as being a consequence of the Unruh effect.
        Where they claimed to lose as much as 35% of the weight of a 375
        kg armature, the Energy Box only loses as much as 2% of its 490
        pounds at this stage of the test cycle. Additional tests and
        modifications are underway to hopefully increase the weight
        loss.<br>
