I can't find this guy on search engines. I might not be romanizing the Russian name right.

Alexey mentions that he invented something that could levitate 5 tons, and he was on his way to Moscow when he was found dead on the train.

Ah yes the Alexey video that he is mentioned in is the graviflyer metal video.
