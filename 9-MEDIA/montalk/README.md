Another GREAT site.

It's slightly word-salady but still good value.

# Biefeld BRown Effect and Antigravity

He proposes that positive and negative charges create inward (gravity) and outward (antigravity?) fields

# His version of UFT

Circulation in the ether generates magnetic field lines along the axis of circulation. Accelerative flows in the ether create electric field lines in the direction of flow. Compressions or expansions in the ether give rise to gravity and antigravity fields. Certain distortions create neither magnetic nor electric effects and these cannot be detected by conventional instruments.

# Alien

His alien theories seem well fleshed out.
