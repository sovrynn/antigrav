        <p align="left">Although some remarkable achievements have been
          made with shortwave low power transmitters, radio experts and
          amateurs have recently decided that shortwave transmission had
          reached its ultimate and hat no vital improvement would be
          made in this line. A short time ago, however, two young
          European experimenters working with ultra-short waves, have
          made a discovery that promises to be of primary importance to
          the scientific world. </p>
        <p align="left">The discovery was made about six weeks ago in a
          newly established central laboratory of the
          Neuuartadline-Werke in Darreskein, Poland, by Dr Kowsky and
          Engineer Frost. While experimenting with the constants of very
          short waves, carried on by means of quartz resonators, a piece
          of quartz which was used, showed a clearly altered appearance.
          It was easily seen that in the center of the crystal,
          especially when a constant temperature not exceeding 10 C / 50
          F was maintained, milky cloudiness appeared which gradually
          developed to complete opacity. The experiments of Dr Meissner,
          of the Telefunken Co,, along similar lines, according to which
          quartz crystals, subjected to high frequency currents clearly
          showed air currents which ld to the construction of&nbsp;
          little motor based on this principle.&nbsp; A week of eager
          experimenting finally led Dr Kowsky and Engineer Frost to the
          explanation of the phenomenon, and further experiments showed
          the unexpected possibilities for technical uses of the
          discovery. </p>
        <p align="left">Some statements must precede the explanation. It
          is known at last in part, that quartz and some other crystals
          of similar atomic nature have the property when exposed to
          potential excitation in a definite direction, of stretching
          and contracting; and if one uses rapidly changing potentials,
          the crystals will change the electric waves into mechanical
          oscillations. This piezo-electric effect, shown in Rochelle
          salt crystals by which they may be made into sound-producing
          devices such as loud-speakers, or reversely into microphones,
          also show the results in this direction. This effect was
          clearly explained in August 1925 <i>Radio News</i> and
          December 1919 <i>Electrical Experimenter</i>. These
          oscillations are extremely small, but have nevertheless their
          technical use in a quartz crystal wave meter and in
          maintaining a constant wavelength in radio transmitters. By a
          special arrangement of the excitation of the crystal in
          various directions, it may be made to stretch or increase in
          length and will not return to its original size. It seems as
          if a dispersal of electrons from a molecule resulted which, as
          it is irreversible, changes the entire structure of the
          crystal so that it cannot be restored to its former condition.
        </p>
        <p align="left">The stretching out, as we may term this strange
          property of the crystal, explains the impairment of its
          transparency. At the same time a change takes place in its
          specific gravity. Testing it on the balance showed that after
          connecting the crystal to the high tension current, the arm of
          the balance on which the crystal with the electrical
          connections rests, rose into the air. The illustration, Fig.
          3, shows this experiment. </p>
        <p align="left">This pointed the way for further investigation
          and the determination of how far the reduction of the specific
          gravity could be carried out. B the use of greater power,
          finally to the extent of several kilowatts and longer exposure
          to the action, it was found eventually that from a little
          crystal, 5 by 2 by 1.5 millimeters. A non-transparent white
          body measuring about 10 centimeters on the side resulted, or
          increased about 20 times in length on any side (See Fig. 4).
          The transformed crystal was so light that it carried the whole
          apparatus with itself upwards, along with the weight of 25
          kilograms (55 lb) suspended from it and floating free in the
          air. On exact measurement and calculation, which on account of
          the excellent apparatus in the Darredein laboratory could be
          readily carried out, it was found that the specific gravity
          was reduced to a greater amount than the change in volume
          would indicate. Its weight had become practically negative. </p>
        <p align="left">There can be no doubt that a beginning has been
          made toward overcoming gravitation. It is to be noted,
          however, that the law of conservation of energy is absolutely
          unchanged. The energy employed in treating the crystal,
          appears as the counter effect of gravitation. Thus the riddle
          of gravitation is not fully solved as yet, and the progress of
          experiments will be followed further. It is, however, the
          first time that experimentation with gravitation which
          hitherto has been beyond the pale of all such research, has
          become possible, and it seems as if there were a way
          discovered at last to explain the inter-relations of gravity
          with electric and magnetic forces, which connection, long
          sought for, has never been demonstrated. This report appears
          in a reliable German journal, <i>Radio Umschau.</i> </p>
