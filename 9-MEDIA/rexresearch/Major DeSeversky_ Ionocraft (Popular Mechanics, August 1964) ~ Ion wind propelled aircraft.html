        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was downright spooky.
            Without a sound, the peculiar, spiky contraption rose
            straight up, hovered awhile, climbed higher. Then it did a
            few graceful turns, stopped again, and just sat there
            silently in midair.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It seemed like levitation
            --- some trick to overcome gravity. I could not shake off
            the feeling that I was attending a kind of spiritual seance,
            or maybe a Buck Rogers show, instead of an engineering
            demonstration. The eerie scene took place in the big barn
            like laboratory of Electron-Atom Inc., research firm in Long
            Island City, New York, devoted to the development of a new
            kind of flying machine. I had been invited to watch a scale
            model being put through its paces by remote control. What we
            saw was by far the oddest aircraft since the Wright
            Brothers' motorized kite.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It had no
            prop. No jet. No wings. In fact, it had no moving parts at
            all looking somewhat like an old-fashioned bedspring, the
            rectangular rig is the nearest thing to a magic carpet. It
            needs no runway, takes off vertically and is expected to
            climb as high as 60 miles. It can crawl through the air like
            a snail, or go faster than a jet. Nobody yet knows the speed
            limit.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After a
            while, I closed my mouth. But David Yorysh, one of the
            project engineers, noticed my puzzlement.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Any
            questions?" he grinned.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Yes. What
            holds it up?"</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Ions," said
            Yorysh, as he launched into an explanation of a wholly new
            flight concept.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The magic
            carpet, called the Ionocraft, flies on pure electricity. It
            depends specifically on the fundamental principle of
            electricity that electric current always flows from negative
            to positive, and it uses two basic pieces of equipment to
            take advantage of this principle --- tall metal spikes that
            are installed above an open wire-mesh grid.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">High negative
            voltage is shot from the spikes toward the positively
            charged wire grid, just like negative and positive poles on
            an ordinary battery. As the negative charge leaves the spike
            arms, it peppers the surrounding air like buckshot, putting
            a negative charge on some of the air particles. Such
            negatively charged air particles are called ions, and these
            are attracted downward by the positively charged grid.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Okay," I
            said. "But I still don't see what holds it up." "I'm getting
            to that," Yorysh assured me as he spelled out the rest of
            the Ionocraft principle. In their mad rush from the ion
            emitter to the main grid, the ions bump into neutral air
            molecules-air particles without electric charge.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The terrific
            wallop in these collisions hurls a mass of neutral air
            down-ward along with ions. When they reach that air grid,
            the ions being negative are trapped by positive charge on
            the grid. but the grid has no attraction for the neutral air
            particles that got bumped along. So the air flows right
            through the open grid mesh, making a downdraft beneath the
            Ionocraft. The contraption rides on this shaft of air,
            getting lift just like a helicopter --- by sucking air down
            from the top.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Aerodynamically,

            it works just like a chopper," Yorysh summed it up. "But
            instead of using a rotor and blades, we create the downward
            air flow electrically by means of ionic discharge. The ions
            act on the air like a man treading water. They just push
            down."</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The engineers
            working on Ionocraft are the first to admit that their
            present rig is still a long way from any kind of practical
            aircraft. The model we saw measures only 1296 square inches
            and consists of about $5 worth of balsa wood and aluminum
            wire. But the principle holds an important promise for the
            future of aviation.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The problem
            now is improving efficiency --- getting enough lift from a
            given grid area and a given amount of energy, Present models
            cannot yet lift their own electric generators. they get
            power through a feeder cable, dangling down like an
            umbilical cord. Ionocraft engineers tend to be close-mouthed
            on performance figures.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But they will
            tell you that at present it takes 90 watts (30,000 volts at
            3 milliamperes) to fly a two ounce model. Translated into
            ordinary power-to-weight ratios, this works out to roughly
            0.96 hp. per pound, as compared with a typical 0.1 hp per
            pound of helicopter or 0.065 hp for a pound Piper Cub.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But Ionocraft
            designers are hard at work upping efficiency. One possible
            power --- boosting technique is to pulse the power in short
            high energy bursts rather than apply steady voltage. They
            are also trying out various grid patterns and ion emitter
            layouts to minimize energy loss through turbulence in the
            downdraft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Despite such
            unresolved problems, the development crew almost bristles
            with optimism, and the most optimistic of all is the
            Ionocraft's inventor Major Alexander P. de Seversky. No
            crackpot, Major de Seversky is a practical visionary who in
            many areas has been far in front of his field.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We hope to
            fly a model with self-contained power, perhaps by the end of
            the year," he told me, confidently.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Ultimately,
            the ionic drive will prove more efficient than either
            propeller or jet as a method of aircraft propulsion.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It will
            achieve lift at less expenditure of energy and fuel than
            existing form of aircraft. In fact, it will prove the most
            efficient method of converting electricity into motion."</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coming from a
            man of de Seversky's background, such a statement has an
            almost prophetic ring. A leading aircraft designer and ace
            flyer for the past 50 years, de Seversky's ideas have often
            been ahead of their time-sometimes to the embarrassment of
            other aviation experts. Losing his right leg during his
            first flying mission in World War I didn't deter him from
            downing 13 enemy aircraft in later flights. After coming to
            the United States from Russia, de Seversky developed
            bombsights and course computers during the 1920s that were
            the forerunners of today's inertial guidance systems.</font>

        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Worked
              with Billy Mitchell ~</font></b> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later he
            pioneered the design of the cantilever-skin stressed wing
            that is now in general use. He was consultant to General
            Billy Mitchell in the historic airplane-versus-battleship
            tactical experiments of the 1920s, and as a special
            consultant to the U.S. Chiefs of Staff helped formulate
            basic air strategy in World War II. He also contributed to
            the designs of the P-35 and P-43 which led to the
            development of the P-47 Thunderbolt, one of America's most
            effective wartime fighter planes. Now a trim and sprightly
            man of 70, he still likes to take out experimental jet
            planes for a spin.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The idea hit
            me as I was working on an electric air-cleaning device which
            I had invented," the major recalled.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That gadget
            was designed to fight air pollution by electrically charging
            the particles in industrial smoke and then trapping them on
            a liquid electrode with the opposite charge."</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">De Seversky
            noticed an air flow developing between the two electrodes,
            caused by ionization process previous explained.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"To an old
            flyer like me," said the major, "anything that stirs up a
            wind is a flying machine. So I began to develop the idea."
            The major seemed concerned that the Ionocraft might be
            mistaken for a kind of space vehicle.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This is not
            a spacecraft," he explained emphatically to forestall any
            misunderstanding. "It's an airplane, designed to operate
            within the atmosphere. But it will be able to do things no
            present type aircraft can accomplish."</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pointing out
            the potential advantage of Ionocraft over conventional
            planes or helicopters, de Seversky ticks off a whole string
            of radical notions:</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>High-altitude

              flight </i>--- Helicopters whirl their blades in utter
            frustration at altitudes where the air gets thin. Beyond
            20,000 feet, they get almost no lift. By contrast, experts
            calculate that Ionocraft can kick up (rather kick down)
            enough air to stay aloft at 300,000 feet.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Unlimited
              size</i> --- The bigger it gets the better it flies.
            Efficiency increases with grid area. Distributing airflow
            around the grid edge becomes proportionately less important
            in larger craft. The reason:</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Grid area
            increases faster than circumference with growing size.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We'll be
            able to build them as big as a city block" claimed de
            Seversky.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>High speed</i>
            --- No practical speed limit has been determined. The ions
            themselves flash from emitter to grid impart to the very
            high-velocity impulse. Aerodynamic drag would be the chief
            speed-limiting factor. But, streamlining of the grid edge
            and careful contouring of the craft, could minimize air
            drag.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Safety</i>
            --- No moving parts in propulsion and no wear, means less
            chance of failure, simpler maintenance.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Steering
              with Voltage ~</font></b> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Steering
            control is accomplished by applying different voltages to
            various parts of the craft. The part with the high voltage
            gets more lift, hence tilts up. The form of the Ionocraft
            does not matter. Any shape will fly, but de Seversky assumes
            that round models in the form of a flying saucer will be the
            most easily manuverable.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By a simple
            joystick control, the pilot can lift any edge of the craft,
            producing pitch and roll as if the Ionocraft had elevators
            and ailerons. He can put the craft into any flight
            attitude-noise up or down, or banking to either side. Like
            the tilt of a helicopter rotor, this inclination pushes the
            craft forward, rearward, or sideways.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">J.F. Bruno,
            the technical director of de Seversky's staff, spoke of a
            passenger gondola in future models, suspended from gimbals
            below the main grid so that it remains level regardless of
            how the main deck is tilted. Locations below the main grid
            also shields passengers from high energy flow. But, even if
            the passengers somehow got into the ion stream, it wouldn't
            electrocute them unless they got "grounded" to the main
            grid. "It would be just like birds sitting on a wire," said
            Yorysh, the man in charge of electronic design.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Until patents
            for Ionocraft were firmly nailed, de Seversky kept his ideas
            carefully under raps. That's another reason no full-scale
            prototype has yet been built. But even present scale models
            set the imagination buzzing. Manned craft are envisioned
            for:</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Commuter
              transport</i> --- With no size limit, you can pack
            trainloads of people into this VTOL craft, relieve traffic
            congestion around urban centers. The type of craft used as
            long-distance transport possibly at supersonic speeds- would
            not need big airports with long run ways.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Airborne
              traffic monitors</i> --- Hovering above bridges and major
            intersections, or patrolling above highways, one-man
            Ionocraft would provide a panoramic view of traffic
            conditions, radio information to ground traffic-control
            centers.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Grid Is
              Hard to Hit ~</font></b> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Military
              reconnaissance and rescue</i> --- Without moving parts,
            the Ionocraft is less vulnerable to small-arms fire than
            helicopters. The open grid makes a poor target. Most bullets
            would whiz right through it. Even if the grid is hit, the
            electric charge would be maintained despite the damage to
            some portions. Unlike a copter with shattered blades, the
            Ionocraft would not crash.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Weather
              observation</i> --- While satellites like Tiros look down
            on the atmosphere from outer space. Ionocraft could sail
            right into the weather-making air layers, providing valuable
            supplemental information. Being steerable, Ionocraft would
            not drift with the wind like weather balloons, but could
            hold a position over crucial areas, making local forecasts
            more reliable.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Skyborne
            antenna, kept aloft indefinitely in a fixed position by
            ground based energy supply. Ionocraft could also act as a
            skyborne antenna, extending the range of defense radar. "It
            would be like raising the DEW-line 60 miles up into the
            air," suggested de Seversky, "adding 15 to 25 minutes
            warning time against missiles."</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Anti-missile

              machine</i> --- Always alert to military tactics, de
            Seversky believes that Ionocraft could be used as missile
            interceptors. Normally the craft would hover at high
            altitudes, scanning the horizon for a 700-mile range. As
            soon as it spotted and identified a hostile missile through
            an infrared detection system, the Ionocraft would hurl
            itself at the enemy rocket on a collision course and blow it
            out of the air.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When
            practical craft are built, their designers expect to have a
            choice of several power supply systems now under development
            for NASA's space program. Some of these include:</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Gas-turbine

              generators</i> --- Several firms, notably General Electric
            and Allis-Chalmers, have come up with compact, light weight,
            kerosene- fueled turbines, originally intended as power
            sources for spacecraft. These may be used to generate
            electricity aboard Ionocraft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Fuel cells</i>---

            These are chemical reactors producing electricity like a
            storage battery, but drawing their chemicals from external

        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
            invention relates to improved heavier-than-air aircraft, and
            more specifically to structures which are capable of either
            hovering or moving in any direction at high altitudes by
            means of ionic discharge.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present
            invention is an improvement over well known electrostatic
            generation of winds used in a novel manner to supply
            propulsion and sustenance forces for a heavier-than-air
            aircraft. Crafts of the types heroin disclosed having
            effective areas of several square feet have been
            successfully flown and contemplated platforms will
            inherently be of large size since the lift force is
            proportionate to the area through which large quantities or
            masses of air are accelerated downwardly from discharge
            electrodes to collection electrodes, the latter being a
            meshed screen, bars, strips or any other structure that
            provides maximum collecting electrode area with
            perforations, slots or other types of opening to allow the
            air to pass through with a minimum of drag. Such a craft
            will be referred to in this application as an Ionocraft.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such
            Ionocraft may serve as platforms which would be stationed
            above the earth for long periods of tinge and serve other
            purposes as will be explained below. The output power from
            microwave generators, such as magnetrons, coupled with high
            power capacity amplifier tubes may be beamed to the
            Ionocraft while airborne or the craft may carry its own
            power supply.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A principal
            object of the present invention is to provide a novel
            Ionocraft with space provided by the structure, preferably
            at the center of the craft, for installation of electronic
            equipment, and for the power plant, and crew where used.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another
            object is to provide a novel Ionocraft construction wherein
            lightweight reinforcing members are provided to form a
            structure sufficiently rigid to cope with the dynamic and
            static loads and to maintain a desired distance between
            discharge emitting wires and the collecting grid.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Still another
            object resides in the novel configuration and arrangement of
            the emitting wires to assure uniform spacing from the
            collecting grid and to provide a maximum number of ionised
            particles for producing the desired lift.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further
            object is to provide an improved Ionocraft of the foregoing
            type wherein some structural formation such as dihedral is
            provided for stabilising the craft during flight. The
            dihedral may be positive or negative depending upon whether
            the hovering flight or horizontal motion of aircraft is a
            primary consideration of performance of the craft. A
            multiple deck structure may be used where desired to
            increase the lifting force, and dihedral may be provided in
            two or more angularly related directions to provide
            stability in all directions. A conical shape with the apex
            or nadir at the top or bottom center may also be
            advantageously used.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Still another
            object is to provide auxiliary ionic discharge structures
            mounted for relational movement which are oriented to
            provide a horizontal propelling force and steering forces
            which can change the direction of the craft. By mounting
            such auxiliary structures to turn about a vertical axis, the
            craft can be made to turn in a horizontal plane about a
            vertical axis passing through the craft to thereby provide a
            scanning or target searching apparatus. A similar scanning
            motion can be achieved by mounting the auxiliary structures
            to turn about a horizontal axis.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further
            object of this invention resides in the provision of a novel
            stick control using variable electrical impedances for
            control of the posture and for manoeuvring the craft through
            variation of the voltage applied to different portions of
            the craft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A second
            principal object of the present invention is to provide a
            combination Ionocraft and antenna system for radio frequency
            energy wherein the structure of the Ionocraft is so arranged
            as to serve in whole or in part as a structure of an
            efficient electromagnetic antenna system. In accordance with
            this object of the invention, the device contains one or
            more antennas that may be used for communication signal
            transmission, for detection, tracking and/or identification
            and for eventual destruction through collision of oncoming
            airborne or space vehicles or missiles and the like. The
            Ionocraft structure may be used, for example, as the main
            antenna element, as a series of directing or reflecting
            elements or as a parasitic element and may be shaped to
            provide arrays parabolas, corner reflectors, horns or lenses
            and be adapted to trans-mit a single or complete spectrum of
            frequencies from the extremely low frequencies to the
            highest frequencies including infrared.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another
            object of this invention is to provide a com-bination
            antenna-Ionocraft with scanning means for detecting and/or
            tracking airborne vehicles or missiles. Such combination may
            also include suitable servo-control and other conventional
            equipment either on the Ionocraft or at a nearby ground
            station for causing the Ionocraft to "lock-on" automatically
            and/or be guided into the path of an "oncoming" vehicle or
            missile.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further
            object is to provide an antenna which constantly locks on a
            radiation beam, such as a microwave or light beam for
            example, projected from the ground or from an aircraft in
            flight to change the position of the Ionocraft in flight.</font>

            to the drawings, FIGURES 1 and 2&nbsp; are plan and
            elevation views of a typical basic embodiment of my improved
            Ionocraft 10. The Ionocraft proper comprises a plurality of
            emitting electrode wires 12 mounted above and in a plan
            substantially parallel to the collecting electrode grid 14
            which may be composed of a meshed screen, bars, strips or
            any other structure that provides maximum effecting
            collecting electrode area with perforations, slots or other
            types of opening to allow the air to pass through with a
            minimum of drag. A plurality of hollow, lightweight rods or
            bars of conductive material or crossed wires forming a mesh
            which is open to pass air downwardly, but with the wires
            sufficiently closely spaced to effectively neutralise the
            charged ions which pass from emitting electrode wires 12 are
            preferred structures. A high D.C. voltage is applied between
            emitting electrode 12 and collecting electrode 14; one pole
            of terminal of the high voltage generator is connected to
            the emitting electrode 12 and the opposite pole or terminal
            of the same generator is connected to the collecting grid
            electrode 14, thus creating a high potential field between
            the electrodes.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this form
            of improved Ionocraft, a basic structure sufficiently rigid
            to cope with the dynamic and static loads and to maintain a
            desired uniform distance between discharge emitting wires 12
            and the collecting grid 14 is utilised comprising an outer
            square or rectangular frame composed of members 22, 24, 26,
            and 28. Diagonal frame members 30 and 32 extend between
            opposite corners of the rectangular frame and a circular
            frame member 34 is fixed tangentially to the midportions of
            the frame members. Sid frame members are coplanar and
            collecting electrode wires 14 are interwoven, as with a
            loom, to form a closely meshed wire screen and supported
            from frame members 22, 24, 26, and 28. The ends of each wire
            are wrapped over and glued to the lower half 26a of the
            frame member and then cut off as shown in FIGURE 2A. The
            upper half 26b of the frame member is then secured in
            position as the glue. A considerable improvement in lifting
            force was achieved when the frame members and cut ends of
            the grid wires were covered with an aluminum foil.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Four
            lightweight rigid structural members, 36 and 38, of which
            two show in FIGURE 2, are mounted beneath the plane of
            collecting grid 14 in the vertical planes to diagonal
            members 30 and 32. Members 36 and 38 meet in a common
            junction 40 at the center of the Ionocraft. Four perforate
            lightweight rigid metal sheets or foils 42 and 44 of
            aluminum or the like, of which only two show in FIGURE 2,
            are mounted between diagonal members 30, 32, 36 and 38.
            These foils provide additional stabilisation against tilting
            by guiding the air flow vertically along the surfaces of the
            foils and have been found to provide and increase in lift
            which more than compensates for their weight. Beneath
            junction 40, a pair of crossed support members 45 and 46 are
            provided to serve as a landing support to hold the craft
            with the collecting grid 14 above the ground supporting
            surface 47 when landed.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The outer
            ends of emitting wires 12 are supported from masts 48, 49,
            50 and 51 of insulating material mounted on opposite sides
            of the craft. In this embodiment, emitting electrode wires
            12 pass diagonally across the craft and cross each other
            near the center. One terminal of a high voltage D.C.
            potential is connected to leads 52 which are connected to
            masts 48 and 49.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The lower
            edges of masts 48 and 50 and of masts 49 and 51 are
            connected together by tension member 53 (FIGURE 2) such as a
            lightweight cable to hold the masts in their vertical
            position by providing a force to balance against the tension
            force of emitting wires 12.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suitable
            lead-in wires 54 are provided for connection between
            collecting grid 14 and the other terminal of the power
            supply, and are preferably at ground potential. Variable
            impedances, such as variable width spark gaps which serve to
            reduce the applied voltage, are provided in lead-in wires 54
            for control of voltage between emitting wires 12 and
            collecting grid 14 to thereby control the vertical movement
            of the craft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An actual
            embodiment built in accordance wit the foregoing
            descriptions which lifted itself into a self-sustaining
            flight had a collecting grid surface area of approximately
            150 square inches and the space between the collecting grid
            and the emitting wires 12 was approximately 2 inches. With a
            craft having the foregoing dimensions, 0.5 milliampere was
            sufficient to make the craft more than self-sustaining. The
            total weight of the structure was approximately 5 grams.
            Other craft having the space between the collecting grid and
            emitting wires of 5 inches have been successfully flown.
            Such craft require voltages of the order of 50 to 60 kV.
            Where the grid area is about 7 or 8 square feel, currents of
            the order of 2 milliamperes exist. Variations in humidity
            and air pressure cause variations in the current drawn and
            in the lifting efficiency.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The lifting
            capability of the craft was found to increase as the
            diameter of the grid wires is increased. Crafts were tested
            with wire diameter of 2, 5, 8 and 12 mils for the collecting
            grid. With wire diameters of 8 mils or more, the current
            requirement to provide the same total lifting force shows a
            detectable decrease thereby indicating a higher efficiency.
            Hollow tubular conductors having an outer diameter of
            one-quarter inch also give substantially the same lift force
            and efficiency as the 8 and 12 mil wire diameters.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A
            modification of the foregoing structure is shown in FIGURE
            3&nbsp; wherein a central compartment section 60 is provided
            in the center of a surrounding large area collecting grid
            14. A plurality of rigid support sections 62, each composing
            an upper member 64, a lower member 66, and an intermediate
            foil 68 extend from the corners of the central section 60 to
            the periphery of the framework surrounding the collecting
            grid 14.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Near each of
            the corners of the outer periphery of collecting grid 14 a
            mast 70 made of insulating material is provided which
            supports the outer end of emitting wires 12. A second group
            of inner support masts 72 mounted on central section 60
            provide support for the inner ends of emitting wires 12.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this
            embodiment, the central compartment 60 is adapted to house
            electronic equipment and the power plant and crew where
            used.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice,
            it has been found desirable to increase the lengths of
            emitting electrode wires by adding a series of wires 74
            which are supported on the main emitting wires 12 and which
            are parallel to each other and at a distance approximately
            equal to the distance of the emitting wires from the
            collecting electrode. The outermost wire is positioned
            inwardly about one-half the distance between the parallel
            wires (i.e., from 1 to 3 inches) from the outer frame
            members on the collecting grid to take full advantage of all
            the ionised particles which are produced. The radially
            directed emitting wires 12 are used to electrically connect
            the non-intersecting wires 74 together. However, the
            emitting wires 12 should be fewer and much less closely
            spaced than collecting grid wires 14 in order to avoid
            electrical symmetry. If the configuration of the emitting
            electrode wires 12 and the collecting electrode wires 14 are
            identical, no lifting force is provided.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further
            embodiment is shown in FIGURE 4 which is identical with the
            form shown in FIGURE 3 except that the structure is equipped
            with positive dihedral for greater stability. Center section
            60 is used as a center load carrying or cabin section and
            the rigid support sections are attached thereto so as to
            tilt upwardly to form a small angle a. Collecting grids 14
            and their associated emitting electrodes 12 on opposite
            sides of center section 60 are thus angularly related.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
            particular craft, because of its horizontal symmetry, is
            well adapted to be equipped with dihedral in the fore and
            aft direction as well as in the lateral direction. FIGURE
            5&nbsp; represents in an exaggerated schematic form and
            apparatus of this type. In FIGURE 5, the central section as
            shown in FIGURE 4 has been omitted and four collecting grids
            14 are of a triangular shape with the inverted apex or nadir
            69 of the system at the bottom and center of the apparatus.
            Separate emitting wires 12 are mounted from masts 71
            supported centrally of the side edges and at the nadir. Each
            of the four collecting grids may be insulated from each
            other by a gap or insulating material and variable
            resistance incorporated in their lead-in connections (not
            shown) to the power supply. By independently varying the
            resistance of the collecting grids the craft, which is here
            assumed rigid, may be tilted in any direction.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGURES 6 and
            7 are top plan and side elevations views respectively of a
            further embodiment which has a negative dihedral. In this
            embodiment, the collecting grid frame composes four outer
            peripheral lightweight wooden or metal members 600, 601, 602
            and 603 which are mounted in a lower plane and four inner
            members 604, 605, 606 and 607 which are parallel to the
            respective outer members but in a plane higher then the
            plane containing the outer members. In an embodiment where
            the outer peripheral members were three feet long, the
            vertical distance between the planes carrying the inner and
            outer members was four inches. This negative dihedral has
            been found to provide greater stability during hovering
            flight than the positive dihedral though the positive
            dihedral appears to provide equally good stability for
            horizontal flight.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            collecting grid is divided into four equal areas by
            diagonally oriented frame assemblies 608, 609, 610 and 611.
            The collecting grid area visible in FIGURE 7 is bounded by
            rigid frame members 612 and 613 of diagonal frame assemblies
            608 and 609 respectively and inner and outer frame members
            604 and 600. The collecting grid, as pointed out above, may
            be a crossed grid of wires. The other three collecting grid
            areas are of identical size and construction.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inside of
            inner frame members 604, 605, 606 and 607, no collecting
            grid screen is provided and the space may be left open or if
            desired, covered with a lightweight foil of insulating or
            conducting material. This air-tight foil forms a pocket
            under which a pressure appears to build up to provide added
            lift. The insulation material is preferred since this does
            not interfere with the electrical isolation between the four
            quadrants of the collecting grid which, as will be pointed
            out below, are used for guiding and/or propelling the craft.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Diagonal
            frame assembly 608 contains four cross braces 626, 628, 630
            and 632 between frame members 612 and 613. The cross braces
            are made of an insulating material such as wood to thereby
            insulate each of the four grid sections from one another.
            Frame members 612 and 613 intersect and are secured together
            above and inwardly behind member 604. Members 614 and 615

        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instead of
            using a crossed wire mesh construction for the collecting
            grid as shown in detail in FIGURE 1, it has been found that
            tubes of conductive material having an outer diameter of
            about one-quarter inch are equally as good. Such tubes may
            be made of aluminum foil wrapped around paper or may be
            hollow lightweight aluminum tubing or of a similar
            construction. For example, material such as an air tight
            nylon base fabric having an evaporated metallic coating of
            for example aluminum may be fabricated in the form of tubes
            having a wall thickness of less then 1 mil and be adapted to
            be inflated with air or inert gas to form a hollow
            lightweight tubular member. The cross section may be
            circular, oval or the like; a tear drop shape as illustrated
            in FIGURE 8 is a preferred configuration since air flow
            across the tapering lower edge provides additional lift. For
            the craft configuration as shown in FIGURES 6 and 7, the
            inflated tubes of FIGURE 8 are mounted parallel to each
            other and to the outer and inner frame members 600 and 604,
            or to their corresponding members in each of the other

        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other
            emitting electrode constructions may also be used. For
            example, emitting wires 640-644 may have suspended from them
            a plurality of short wires 680 as shown in FIGURE 9 which
            provide a point of discharge rather than a line of discharge
            to thereby increase the efficiency of ionisation. In FIGURE
            9, only emitting wire 640 and its supporting masts 646 and
            647 from the embodiment shown in FIGURES 6 and 7 are
            illustrated. It is to be understood that all of the emitting
            wires may be of similar construction to that illustrated in
            FIGURE 9. Each of wires 680 is about 1 to 3 or more inches
            in length and separated at least one inch apart. The lower
            ends of wires 680 are kept at a uniform distance from the
            collecting grid. This construction may offer some
            pre-ionisation, though measurements show this emitting
            electrode construction to be about comparable to the use of
            plain wire as the emitting electrode.</font> </p>

            shaped Ionocrafts respectively. The craft of FIGURE 11 is
            triangular in config-uration and is provided with emitting
            wires 12 suitably supported from masts 48 as illustrated. In
            practice additional emitting wires may be used. Collecting
            grid 14 extends over a large area beneath emitting wires 12
            and may be formed of crossed wires as diagrammatically
            illustrated.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            electromagnetic energy antenna carried by the foregoing
            Ionocraft embodiments may comprise a series of generally
            horizontal, parallel conducting elements or dipoles 70
            arranged along the basic side structure on which the wires
            12 and 14 of the craft are attached. Dipoles 70 may be of
            differing length so that the antenna provided may receive or
            transmit several different frequencies. For frequencies of
            the order of 10 megacycles, for example, several dipoles 71,
            74 and 76 may be arranged as a tuned array, such as the yagi
            array, with one or more dipoles 71 serving as a director,
            dipole 74 serving as the main antenna element and dipole 76
            serving as a reflector. Such antenna is highly directional
            and with an Ionocraft of triangular configuration, the
            antenna may be used with signal transmission in three
            separate directions simultaneously.</font> </p>

            bars 78 of either a conducting or insulating material, as
            dictated by conventional antenna construction techniques.
            Additional antenna elements 80, 82 and 84 may be present as
            metal rods or wires separated electrically from the adjacent
            antenna elements by insulators 86 of a suitable light
            material such as wood, plastic or the like, indicated on the
            drawing by spaces.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The various
            antenna elements 70-84 and insulators 86 may comprise a
            rigid frame forming the basic structure for the craft and
            inside of which the collecting grid 14 is supported and upon
            which the discharge electrodes 11 are mounted. The antenna
            elements 70-84 may be stacked vertically if desired to
            improve both the efficiency of the antenna and the rigidity
            of the basic structure. To the extent that the antenna
            elements may be galvanically connected together without
            interfering with the operation of the antenna in its
            conventional manner, the antenna elements are preferably
            connected to the same DC potential as collecting grid 14.
            Thus, the antenna elements may also augment the operation of
            the Ionocraft by neutralising charged ions which provide the
            propelling force.</font> </p>

            for an entire spectrum of frequencies having different wave
            lengths Xx, X2, X3... Xn. Since the length of a side of the
            Ionocraft may be several hundred feet or greater, such

            schematically and designated by reference numeral 92. A
            ground station antenna which is indicated diagrammatically
            at 94 on FIGURE 10 may be provided for directing the signals
            downwardly to the ground station. Antenna 94 may be of any

            the main antenna structure 92 by a suitable transmission
            line such as coaxial cable, twin lead lines or hollow pipe
            wave-guide, depending upon the particular frequencies
            utilised. Amplifiers or frequency converters may also be
            provided in the transmission line where signal strength is
            weak. The amplifiers and/or frequency converters may be
            powered by well known self-contained batteries or by the

        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now
            to FIGURES 13 and 14, a further embodiment of the invention
            is illustrated which has a plurality of side sections, four
            of which are shown curved. The contour of the curves may be
            parabolic or of any other shape as is conventionally used
            for antennas in high frequency systems such as radar or the
            like. In this embodiment, an outside frame of lightweight
            rigid 0.5 members 96, 98, 100 and 102 is provided to define
            the contour of the antenna shape. Lightweight wires or rods
            104 extend between members 95 and 102 to serve as part of
            the antenna. Lightweight sheet metal of a material such as
            aluminum may be used in lieu of wires 104 for the 30
            reflector surface if desired.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A plurality
            of horns 106 are illustrated in the drawings to effect
            simultaneous radar scanning through 360. By oscillating the
            illustrated Ionocraft about its vertical center line through
            an angle of only 45 on each side of a center position,
            complete 360 scanning may be effected. Alternatively, the
            Ionocraft may be rotated continuously about its vertical
            center line and 360 scanning effected by one or more
            antennas. Such scanning may be effected by warped corners,
            reactive or propeller blasts of auxiliary power plant, or by
            auxiliary grids which are mounted for movement relative to
            the main lifting grid as will be described below. Scanning
            may be effected by other means as will become apparent from
            the following description. In lien of or supplemental to
            some of the microwave antennas 106, antenna reflectors for
            infrared detectors may be carried on the Ionocraft. Such
            antennas serve to collect the infrared energy over a large
            area and focus such energy on a small infrared detector, and
            they may be of any conventional construction. The basic
            structure 10 between spaced antennas may contain such
            equipment to transmit via wireless signal channels to the
            ground station through ground station antenna 94, signals
            corresponding to the electromagnetic and radio frequency
            signals received. Horizontal movement of the craft may be
            effected by the principles set forth in Serial No. 760,390
            of Glenn E.Hagen filed September 11, 1958, by tilting the
            craft downwardly in the forward direction whereby the ionic
            propulsion force provides a horizontal force component to
            cause the craft to move in a horizontal direction. Tilting
            of the craft may easily be effected through variation of the
            voltage between emitting electrodes 12 and collecting grid
            electrode 14. For example, by electrically separating the
            craft into four sections of substantially equal size as
            illustrated in FIGURE 15, the voltage applied to two of the
            adjacent sections can be reduced by adding resistance in
            series with the current path and this will cause the lift
            produced by these two sections to decrease relative to the
            lift produced by the two other sections. Thus, horizontal
            movement of the craft may easily be controlled from the
            ground station. For manual control of the posture and flight
            movement of the craft of the present invention, it has been
            found desirable to provide a control stick assembly which
            functions similar to that familiar to persons flying other
            types of aircraft. The control stick must function in both
            the longitudinal and lateral directions simultaneously and
            independently. Variable control elements such as
            potentiometers and variable transformers (powerstats for
            instance) may be used for control of the present invention.
            The posture of the craft may be controlled by dividing the
            collecting grid into three or more electrically separate
            regions as illustrated by the embodiment shown in FIGURES 6
            and 7 and by individually varying the electrical potential
            to each of the separate regions. The potential may be
            increased to act as an elevator or may be decreased to act
            as a spoiler, and the voltage may be increased on one side
            while being simultaneously decreased on the other side to
            increase the effectiveness of the control.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, the
            emitting wires may be divided into three or more
            electrically separate regions and the electrical potential
            individually varied to each separate region. Again the
            potential may be increased or decreased, and may be
            simultaneously increased in one region and decreased in the
            opposite region.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To change the
            voltage to an individual region of the craft, a separate
            power supply for each region may be provided and the
            variable control element for changing the output voltage may
            be adjusted to produce the desired voltage level. Where a
            single power supply is provided, variable resistance may be
            placed in the electrical conductors leading to the
            appropriate terminals on the craft. If the craft is normally
            airborne with resistance present in the conductors, then
            increased voltage can be supplied to one region of the craft
            by decreasing the resistance in the conductor connected to
            that region. A decreased voltage can be supplied similarly
            by increasing the amount of resistance, and combination of
            increased and decreased voltages may be supplied to opposite
            sides of the craft to increase response of the craft to the
            controls.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the
            more simple ways to utilise the power supplied to the craft,
            I prefer not to have extra resistance in the power supply
            circuit of the emitting wires during normal flight and to
            control the posture of the craft by individually adding
            resistance into the circuit connected to each individual
            region of the collector grid. Such method of control has
            been found to provide adequate control of the Ionocraft and
            a control stick assembly will be described which utilises
            variable resistance elements which are conventionally known
            as potentiometers or rheostats.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In FIGURE 16
            the collecting grid construction as shown in the preceding
            embodiments (see for example FIGURES 6 and 7) is illustrated
            with each of the four grid sections W, X, Y, and Z connected
            through a separate correspondingly designated potentiometer
            to one terminal of the power supply. The emitting wires
            shown diagrammatically as waving lines are connected through
            a throttle control potentiometer, which is used to control
            the maximum voltage applied between the emitting wires and
            all of the collecting grid sections. When this voltage
            exceeds a certain level but yet remains less than that which
            causes arcing, the craft will rise. The effect of
            potentiometers A, B, C and D is to controllably reduce the
            voltage between the emitting wires and any one or two
            specific grid sections to thereby reduce or subtract from
            the effectiveness of that portion of the craft in producing
            its lifting force. This then causes the craft to tilt
            downwardly in the direction of whichever of the grid
            sections has the reduced voltage.</font> </p>

            mounted on bracket F.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foregoing
            construction permits the control stick to function both in a
            longitudinal direction and in the lateral direction
            simultaneously to function as an electrostatic spoiler in
            the sense that when the craft is airborne, the addition of
            resistance in the lead-in wire to a particular grid section
            spoils the lift of that section to thereby control the
            posture of the craft in flight.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            described embodiment, stick movement was limited to about
            40 by mechanical stops not shown. The pitch diameter of
            each gear segment G and H was about 6 inches and the pitch
            diameter of the pinion gears on the potentiometer shafts was
            about 1 inch. The potentiometer gear shafts were capable of
            rotating through 240, and were spring biased to a zero
            resistance con-dition.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As is
            apparent from FIGURES 17 and 18, the position of the pinion
            gears for the four potentiometers A, B, C and D is at the
            exact ends of the corresponding gear segments so that when
            the control stick is in its illustrated vertical position,
            each potentiometer is rendered ineffective to add any
            resistance to any of the collecting grid sections. As the
            control stick is tilted, one of the potentiometer shafts is
            rotated and there is absolutely no possibility that the
            potentiometer to the opposite grid section can be made
            effective at the same time because the partial gear segment
            and the spring loaded potentiometer shafts are used. The
            length of each gear segment must be at least as large as the
            maximum angle through which the stick can be moved, and the
            pinion gears are preferably at the precise ends of the gear
            segments.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was found
            that if the potentiometer shafts were not spring loaded, the
            gears would upon occasion rotate slightly so the teeth did
            not always mesh when the stick was moved in a direction so
            that the gear segment should have engaged the potentiometer
            pinion. By the manual control stick just described, adequate
            tilt of the craft is readily achieved. The position of the
            craft in air may be remotely controlled from a ground
            station through wireless control systems which may be of any
            suitable known type. The horizontal position of the craft
            may also be controlled automatically. For example, the
            position of the craft of the present invention may be
            automatically controlled in space through means of suitable
            centering or tracking appara-tus operating on well known
            principles, such for example as are disclosed in U.S. Patent
            Nos. 2,513,367 to Scott, or 2,604,601 to Menzel. In such
            tracking apparatus, one form of which is diagrammatically
            illustrated in FIGURE 15, a beam of electromagnetic energy,
            such as light or infrared, is centered on a suitable
            photocell 128 which generates control signals that are used
            to control variable impedances to reduce the voltage applied
            to various sections of the craft to thereby control the
            position of the craft in accordance with the position of the
            beam source at the ground station.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGURE 15
            illustrates in detail suitable horizontal 7a positioning
            control arrangement. The common grid electrode 14 is
            connected to the negative terminal of the power supply and
            the emitting wires 12 are electrically separated into four
            sections, viz. left front LF, left rear LR, right front RF
            and right rear RR. Each of these sections is connected
            through variable impedances 130, 132, 134 and 136
            respectively of the elevator control unit and the variable
            impedances 138 and 140 of the aileron control unit to the
            positive terminal of the power supply. The elevator motor
            142 drives the movable con-tacts on variable impedances 130,
            132, 134 and 136 and the aileron motor 144 controls in a
            similar manner values of the impedances 138 and 140. Each
            motor 142 and 144 may be driven by separate amplifiers 146
            and 148 and pre-amp 150 in a manner as conventionally used
            in servo systems to position photocell unit 128 directly in
            alignment with a source of electromagnetic energy positioned
            on the ground.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now
            to FIGURE 19, a craft having a central cabin 160 and
            equipped with dihedral is illustrated. The collecting grid
            14 and emitting wire 12 construction may be similar to that
            described in connection with FIGURE 4&nbsp; and be
            positioned on alternate sides of cabin 160. Beneath cabin
            160, a suitable wheeled, skid or pontoon landing gear 162
            may be provided.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Depending
            beneath frame members 164 and on opposite sides of cabin 160
            are a pair of auxiliary grid as-semblies 166 and 167 that
            are mounted to be operable in a generally vertical plane.
            Each auxiliary grid assembly 166 and 167 is provided with
            laterally spaced emitting wires 168 and a collecting grid
            within outer frame members 170 so that upon receipt of a
            suitable D.C. potential, a horizontal thrust is provided in
            the manner here in before set forth.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each
            auxiliary grid assembly 166 and 167 is mounted on frame
            members 164 for independent rotational move-ment about
            substantially horizontal axes 172 and 173. With the emitting
            wires 168 of both auxiliary grid assemblies facing in the
            same direction, the craft will proceed in the direction
            toward the emitting wires. With the emitting wires 168 of
            auxiliary grid assembly 167 facing in a rearward direction
            and emitting wires of grid assembly 166 facing in a forward
            direction as illustrated in FIGURE 19, the craft will
            revolve about an axis midway between the effective centers
            of the two grid assemblies. If the craft is simultaneously
            tilted in a cyclical manner, an effective radar antenna
            searching motion is provided which may include a large
            vertical angle as well as a 360 horizontal scanning
            operation.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Except where
            rotation of the craft for searching or scanning operations
            is a principal purpose for the craft, the emitting wires 168
            of each auxiliary grid assembly 166 and 167 are mounted to
            face in the same direction. When landing or taking off,
            which is always accomplished in a vertical direction,
            auxiliary grid assemblies 166 and 167 are preferably pivoted
            into a horizontal plane. This not only retracts them to
            prevent interference with landing operations, but also
            provides a multiple deck structure to give additional lift
            and control of stability. Horizontal speed may be controlled
            by varying the angle of auxiliary grid assemblies 166 and
            167 with the vertical.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in
            FIGURE 20, the Ionocraft may comprise several decks 180, 182
            and 184 each of which is of similar construction to the
            single-decked craft shown in FIGURES 10-14. Each of the
            basic structures 180, 18l and 184 may comprise different
            antenna types if desired. Several separate ground station
            antennas 186, 188 and 190 may be provided particularly where
            independent signals are transmitted and received by the
            several antennas of the Ionocraft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In FIGURE 21,
            a multiple decked craft is illustrated which comprises a
            central cabin 20P, from which two lifting grid assemblies
            292 and 203 extend laterally on opposite sides which are
            equipped with dihedral. Above grid assemblies 201 and 203,
            one or more pairs of similar grid assemblies 204 and 205 are
            supported by a suitable superstructure 108. The turning axes
            212 and 213 for auxiliary grid assemblies 210 and 211 in
            this embodiment are substantially vertical and extend
            through support members 214 and 215 to the upper grid
            assemblies 204 and 105 to provide added rigidity to the
            craft structure. Retractable antennas 220 and 221 may be
            provided beneath cabin 200 for establishing communication
            channels to the ground station (not shown).</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general,
            it makes little difference whether the emitting wires 12 are
            connected to the negative or to the positive terminal of the
            power supply. By tests, it has been determined that with
            emitting wires 12 connected to the negative terminal, there
            is an improvement of about 5% over that obtained when the
            emitting wires 12 are connected to a positive terminal.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            multiple deck constructions, it is preferable to connect
            emitting wires 12 and collector grid wires 14 of the
            adjacent decks to opposite terminals of the high voltage
            generator as illustrated in FIGURE 20, thus making discharge
            or emitting wires 12 in alternate decks positive and the
            collector grids negative which is the reverse of the
            .polarity shown in FIGURE 1. In that case, tilting is
            effected by varying either the negative or positive
            potential of the corresponding emitting electrode wires and
            grid sections to provide a rolling movement longitudinally
            and laterally.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the above
            mechanisms and procedures provided for manual control can be
            utilised for automatic control actuated by an automatic
            pilot director through suitable servo-mechanisms.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tilting
            of the craft in the case of embodiments like those
            diagrammatically indicated in FIGURE 15 and 16 provides
            forward gliding movements much in the manner that a
            helicopter is propelled in a horizontal direction. Where
            other means are used for horizontal propulsion, such for
            example the auxiliary grids shown in FIGURES 19 and 21 or in
            conjunction with propellers or jet stream, then the tilting
            will be used to maintain a desirable posture in space. All
            these move-ments may be controlled automatically by
            conventional stabilising and steering mechanisms borne by
            the craft or such movement may be accomplished from remote
            transmitting points either on the ground or from another
            airborne craft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The maximum
            size of crafts of the type here involved is theoretically
            unlimited, except for structural considera-tions, since the
            mount of lift provided increases continuously with area. It
            is thus contemplated that a particularly useful function of
            the craft of the present invention may be to serve as means
            for destruction through collision oncoming vehicles and
            missiles through air and space. Intercontinental as well as
            space missiles enter the atmosphere over a target area in
            predictable trajectories, the terminal end of which is a
            substantially vertical path. Thus, the large horizontal area
            of the craft of the present invention is particularly
            suitable for the purpose of protecting sensitive target
            areas such as large cities, naval task forces, troop
            concentrations and the like by its mere physical presence
            during hovering operations. By manoeuvring the craft
            laterally it is possible to protect an area much larger than
            the area of the craft since present detection systems give
            identifying information of the target area about 15 minutes
            prior to arrival of the missile and the lateral movement of
            the craft may be effected at speeds of the order of 60 miles
            per hour, or more depending upon the horizontal propulsion
            system used. If the target area is vast, several Ionocraft
            could be maintained aloft to assure collision with oncoming
            missiles.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the
            craft may be powered through conductors 70 extending from
            ground or ship towers or via microwave power transmissions,
            it is contemplated that lightweight power plants such as gas
            turbines or the like, be used to drive suitable high voltage
            generators which are aboard the craft. As shown in FIGURE
            22, turbine 230 may be so mounted that its exhaust is
            directed vertically downwardly to provide additional lifting
            force while providing shaft rotation for producing the
            electrical power for the Ionocraft. Turbine 230 is here
            shown to be mounted for pivotal movement about the axis of
            shaft 232 which is driven by a tilt motor 134 to change the
            direction of the exhaust gases from vertical toward a
            horizontal direction. The entire tilt motor 234, shaft 232
            and turbine 230 assembly may be mounted to be rotated in
            azimuth by azimuth motor 236 driving annular ring gear 238.
            Thus, in emergency operations where maximum horizontal
            speeds are desired, motors 234 and 236 may be controlled to
            advance the craft at higher velocities.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other types
            of convention airborne power plants, such as :turbine
            propeller combinations, may also be utilised for providing
            additional lift and aiding in maneuvring in the atmosphere.
            The turbine of FIGURE 15 may be provided with a reverse
            thrust device or such propellers may have a reversible
            pitch, and steering may be accomplished by rudders or vanes
            located in the jet stream of the turbine. Also, high voltage
            generation by radioactive isotopes is another method of
            obtaining the necessary high voltage energy or a primary
            source of ionisation for the propulsion and sustenance of
            the Ionocraft.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also
            contemplated that this craft may be supplied with electrical
            power transmitted to the Ionocraft while in flight by
            microwaves. It has .been demonstrated 80% of the energy
            emitted from a ground station microwave antenna array can be
            collected in the form of heat by airborne vehicles. In this
            case, such heat may be readily converted into high voltage
            by conventional means such as turbines operating high
            voltage generators, suitable thermocouples and
            vibrator-transformer converters or the like. The use of high
            power microwave amplifiers, such as Amplitrons (Raytheon
            Co.), for power transmission via microwaves can provide the
            requisite power for a craft of this type. Therefore, it may
            be not essential that a self contained power unit be carried
            by the craft for special uses.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            preferred form of the craft adapted for military purposes,
            directional detecting apparatus such as radar or infrared
            equipment will be carried by the craft to enable an antenna
            on the craft to lock-on any target object in air and space
            for the purpose of guiding the craft into the path of such
            oncoming target object. An Ionocraft of sufficient lift
            capacity may carry its own computers to process the
            electromagnetic information to provide the necessary
            impulses to the controls of the propulsive means to place
            the craft in the path of collision. Such craft may also be
            guided from the surface of the earth or from an airborne
            vehicle in flight, by remote control means to accomplish the
            collision with an oncoming object.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Explosives
            may be carried by the Ionocraft for destroying such oncoming
            objects if the mass of the Ionocraft is inadequate for
            destructive purposes. Such explosives may be of any known
            type and adapted to be detonated either upon impact or by
            proximity fuses where desired. Other types of
            countermeasures or defensive devices for causing premature
            explosions of the warhead of a missile may be carried by the
            Ionocraft as occasions arise.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention
            may be embodied in other specific forms without departing
            from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The
            present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all
            respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of
            the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather
            than by the foregoing description, and all changes which
            come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the
            claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.</font>
