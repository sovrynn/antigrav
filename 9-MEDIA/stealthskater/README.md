Physics stuff

I've downloaded various kinds of files but there are SO MANY and SO WELL CURATED they are.

# Allan's time

Allan's Time had some stuff on unified field but it was meh. Also on Antigravity

Idk after going through a bunch of these unified field theories I get a feel very quickly whether it's good or not. Something that I prefer to avoid is handwavey pseudosciencey attempts to describe in unique ways the "magical ether" without any attempts at experimentation or solving anomalies

# ECE (Einstein-Cartan-Evans (ECE) theory)

Sounds promising.

"Torsion (which is a twisting of space) turns out to be essential and inextricably linked to curvature, because if the torsion is zero then the curvature vanishes. In fact, torsion is even more important than curvature, because the unified laws of gravitation and electrodynamics are basically physical interpretations of twisting, which is formally described by the torsion tensor. ECE theory unifies physics by deriving all of it directly and deterministically from Cartan geometry, and does so without using adjustable parameters in the foundational axioms. The parameters that combine geometry with physics are derived from experimental data and are thus not arbitrarily adjustable. Spacetime is completely specified by curvature and torsion, and ECE theory uses these underlying fundamental qualities to derive all of physics from differential geometry, and to predict quantum effects without assuming them (as postulates) from the beginning. It is the first (and only) generally covariant, objective and causal unified field theory."

They have 460 papers, wtf? The first paper was published in 2003, damn

They're quite mathematical, I've downloaded some of the papers here.

Holy fuck, the math is all going over my head...
