          Sussex) </p>
        <p>June 1985 </p>
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p>The objective of this report is to reconstruct the experimental
        work carried out between 1946 and 1956 by John R. R. Searl that
        concerns the geometry, materials used, and the manufacturing
        process of the Sear1-Effect Generator (SEG). </p>
      <p>The information given here is based on private communication
        between the author and Searl and should be considered
        preliminary as further research and development may give reason
        to alter and/or update the content. </p>
      <p><b>The Gyro-Cell</b> </p>
      <p>The SEG consists of a basic drive unit called the Gyro-Cell
        (GC) and, depending on the application, is either fitted with
        coils for generation of electricity or with a shaft for transfer
        of mechanical power. The GC can also be used as a high voltage
        source. Another and important quality of the GC 1s its ability
        to levitate. </p>
      <p>The GC can be considered as an electric motor entirely
        consisting of permanent magnets in the shape of cylindrical bars
        and annular rings. </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the basic GC in its simplest form, consisting of
        one stationary annular ring-shaped magnet, called the plate, and
        a number of moving cylinder-shaped rods called runners. </p>
      <center>

        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p>During operation each runner is spinning about its axis and is
        simultaneously orbiting the plate in such a manner that a fixed
        point p on the curved runner surface traces out a whole number
        of cycloids during one revolution round the plate, as shown by
        the dotted lines in Figure 2. </p>
      <center>
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center><img src="John%20Searl_%20Searl-Effect%20Generator%20~%20S.%20Gunnar%20Sandberg_%20SEG%20Design%20&amp;%20Manufacture_%20(1985)_files/fig2a.jpg" width="253" height="182">
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p>Measurements have revealed that an electric potential
        difference is produced in the radial direction between plate and
        runners; the plate being positively charged and the runners
        negatively charged, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>In principle, no mechanical constraints are needed to keep the
        GC together since the runners are electromagnetically coupled to
        the plate. However, used as a torque producing device, shaft and
        casing must be fitted to transfer the power produced.
        Furthermore, in applications where the generator is mounted
        inside a framework, the runners should be made shorter than the
        height of the plate to prevent the runners from catching the
        frame or other parts. </p>
      <p>When in operation, gaps are created by electromagnetic
        interaction and centrifugal forces preventing mechanical and
        galvanic contact between plate and runners and thereby reducing
        the friction to negligible values. </p>
      <p>The experiments showed that the power output increases as the
        number of runners increase and to achieve smooth and even
        operation the ratio between external plate diameter Dp and
        runner diameter Dr should be a positive integer greater than or
        equal to 12. Thus: </p>
      <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P/D<sub>r</sub> = N &gt; 12 (N = 12, 13,
        14, &amp;c) </p>
      <p>The experiments also indicated that the gaps O between adjacent
        runners should be one runner diameter D as shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>More complex Gyro-Cells can be formed by adding further plates
        and runners to the basic unit. Figure 3 illustrates a 3-plate GC
        consisting of three sections, A, B and C. Each section consists
        of one plate with corresponding runners. </p>

      <center><img src="John%20Searl_%20Searl-Effect%20Generator%20~%20S.%20Gunnar%20Sandberg_%20SEG%20Design%20&amp;%20Manufacture_%20(1985)_files/fig3a.jpg" width="351" height="246">
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p>The experiments showed that for stable and smooth operation
        sections should be of equal weight. Thus: </p>
      <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W<sub>A</sub> = W<sub>B</sub> = W<sub>C</sub>
      </p>
      <p>where </p>
      <p>W<sub>A</sub> = weight of section A, <br>
        W<sub>E</sub> = weight of section E, <br>
        W<sub>C</sub> = weight of section C. </p>
      <p><b>The Magnetic Field Configuration</b> </p>
      <p>Due to a combined DC and AC magnetising process, each magnet
        acquires a specific magnetic pole pattern recorded on two tracks
        consisting of a number of individual N-poles and S-poles, as
        illustrated in Figure 4. </p>
      <p>Magnetic measurements have revealed that the poles are
        approximately one millimetre across and evenly spaced. It was
        also found that the pole density (<i>x</i>) --- defined as the
        total number of poles N per track divided by the circumference,
        pi D --- must be a constant factor specific for a particular
        generator. Thus: </p>
      <p>x = N<sub>p</sub> / 3.14 D<sub>p </sub>= N<sub>r </sub>/ 3.14
        D<sub>r</sub> </p>
      <p>where N<sub>p</sub> is the total number of poles per track on
        plate and N<sub> r</sub> is the total number of poles per track
        on runner. </p>
      <center>
        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> </p>

        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p>Furthermore, the distance d<sub>r</sub> between the two pole
        tracks must be the same for all runners and plates which are
        parts of the same GC. </p>
      <p>The pole tracks allow automatic commutation to take place and
        create a turning moment. Exactly how this is achieved is not
        understood and will require further research efforts. </p>
      <p>Likewise, the source of energy is at present unknown. Further
        research is also needed to establish the exact mathematical
        relationship between output power, speed, geometry and material
        parameters, such as mass density and electromagnetic properties
        of the materials used. </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic Materials</b> </p>
      <p>The magnets used in the original experiments were made of a
        mixture of two types of ferromagnetic powders imported from the
        USA. One of these magnets, still in existence, has been
        qualitatively analyzed and was found to contain the following
        elements:&nbsp;&nbsp; Aluminum, Silicon, Sulfur, Titanium,
        Neodymium, Iron. The spectrogram is illustrated in figure 5. </p>

      <p><b>The Induction Coils</b> </p>
      <p>If the SEG is sued as an electrical power plant a number of
        induction coils must be fitted to the GC. The coils consist of
        C-shaped cores made of soft steel (Swedish steel) or high
        u-ferrite (mu-metal). The number of turns and wire gauge used
        depends on the application. Figure 6 shows the basic design. </p>

        <hr width="62%"></center>
      <p><b>Stage 1: Magnetic Materials &amp; Bonding Agents</b> </p>
      <p>It is feasible that future research will reveal other magnetic
        raw materials to be cheaper and/or more efficient than the ones
        used in the original experiments. It is also possible that other
        types of binder may improve the performance. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 2: Weighing</b> </p>
      <p>In general, to produce efficient magnets the right amount of
        each element contained in the ferromagnetic powder is crucial.
        It is therefore reasonable to suggest that when mixing different
        types of powders an optimal weight ratio does exist that will
        produce a 'best' magnet. </p>
      <p>At present, however, this weight ratio is not known for the
        powders used by Searl in his past experiments. Together with new
        magnetic materials and optimization of generator geometry, this
        is an area in which research efforts could be profitable. </p>
      <p>In general, the amount of binder used should be as small as
        possible to achieve maximum mass density of bonded magnets.
        However, the possibility that the binder is taking an active
        part in the generation of the Searl-Effect must not be excluded.
        For instance, the dielectric properties of the binder may play
        an active role in the electromagnetic interactions taking place
        in the SEG. If that is the case, then a further amount of
        bonding material may be beneficial. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 3: Mixing</b> </p>
      <p>The mixing is an important process which will decide the
        homogenity and reliability of the finished product. A
        homogeneous mixture can be achieved by using turbulent air flow
        inside the mixing container The experiments did show that an
        improved performance was achieved if all magnets for the same
        generator were made from the same batch. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 4: Moulding</b> </p>
      <p>During the moulding process the compound- consisting of
        ferromagnetic powders. and thermoplastic binder is compressed
        and simultaneously cured by heating. Figure 8 illustrates the
        tool used for making 'blinds'. A 'blind' is an unmagnetized
        runner or plate/part of plate. When manufacturing large plates
        (D<sub>p</sub> &gt; 30 cm) it may be necessary to make them in
        segments rather than in one piece. </p>

      <p>The figures given below should be considered as guidelines
        only, since correct data are not available regarding the
        influence of the moulding process on the Searl-Effect. </p>
      <p>1. Pressure: 200-400 bars <br>
        2. Temperature: 150 C-200 C <br>
        3. Compression time: &gt; 20 minutes. </p>
      <p>Before releasing the pressure the mould must be allowed to
        cool. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 5: Machining</b> </p>
      <p>This process can be bypassed if the weighing and moulding
        procedures are carried out correctly. However, it may be
        necessary to polish the cylindrical surface of runners and
        plates. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 6: Inspection</b> </p>
      <p>Control of dimensions and surface finish. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 7: Magnetization</b> </p>
      <p>Runners and plates are individually magnetized in a combined DC
        and AC-field during one on-off duty cycle. Figure 9 illustrates
        the magnetizing circuit. </p>

      <p>The function of the automatic control switch (ACS) is to

        that the instantaneous value of the total magnetomotive force

        <b>Stage 8: Inspection</b> </p>
      <p>The purpose of this control is to test for the existence of and
        the correct spacing of the two pole tracks. The measurements can
        be made with a magnetic flux density meter in combination with a
        set of control magnets. </p>
      <p><b>Stage 9: Assembling</b> </p>
      <p>The assembling procedure depends on the application. Used as a
        mechanical drive unit, the magnets must be mounted inside a
        framework and fitted to a drive shaft. Used as an electric power
        plant, induction coils must be fitted to the framework.</p>
