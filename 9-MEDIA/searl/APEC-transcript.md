# Searl Effect Generator (SEG) – Project Overview

## Overview
This document summarizes the design, operation, and development status of Isaiah’s Searl Effect Generator (SEG) builds, based on insights from a detailed interview.  
Current version discussed: **Version 3** (Isaiah is now working on Version 6 and 7).

---

## Design Summary
- **Core Materials**: Nickel 200 core, Teflon, magnetic layer, copper.
- **Rollers**: Same layered structure as core.
- **Electromagnets**: Laminated steel with MOSFET pulsers.
- **Sensors**: LED-based, one per electromagnet for independent control.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Sensors on core, coils, and MOSFETs.
- **Power**: Milwaukee rechargeable battery (3 Ah).

---

## Performance
- Spin-up to **150–180 RPM** in current single-roller version.
- **Carousel version** can exceed **598 RPM**.
- Rollers maintain equal spacing under sufficient power.
- Adjustable speed control.

---

## Observed Behavior
- Quieter operation at certain RPM thresholds.
- Stable magnetic spacing between rollers and stator.
- No cooling effect observed yet in current builds.

---

## Build Process
- **Timeframe**: 3–4 months for Version 3.
- Laminated steel increased electromagnet strength vs. solid iron.
- Multiple parallel wires per coil lowered resistance and increased field strength.
- MOSFETs heat up quickly under load.

---

## Searl’s Law of the Squares
- Specifies precise roller layer weights within **0.1 g accuracy**:
  - Neodymium: 13 g
  - Teflon: 4 g
  - Magnetic layer: 10 g
  - Copper: 7 g
- Strict adherence believed to optimize electron flow.

---

## Materials & Experiments
- Experimental cores: partially magnetized or raw uncoated neodymium.
- Target: 99% pure neodymium with resin binder (oxidation-resistant).
- Smaller prototypes have confirmed viability.

---

## Reported Effects in Historical Builds
- Cooling effect (Godin & Rhoan, Delin).
- Self-spin after certain RPM.
- Magnetic lock preventing roller detachment.
- Transient weight reduction (Morningstar Energy Box).

---

## Notable Replications
- **Godin & Rhoan**: Cooling and self-spin.
- **Morningstar Energy Box**: Claimed transient weight reduction.
- **Delin (Russia)**: Rapid cooling.
- **Fernando Morris**: Specialized magnetization; 200 RPM at 6V, 1.6A.
- **Kumar (India)**: Three working SEGs; one ran autonomously before failure after reassembly.

---

## Challenges in Modern Construction
- Complex magnetization process (AC & DC at megawatt levels).
- Lack of industrial-scale resources compared to Searl’s original team.
- Extreme precision required for weight, alignment, and material purity.

---

## Next Steps – Version 7 Goals
- Remove electromagnets; use inductors only.
- Flat-plate stator with visible rollers (no carousel).
- Hidden drive for “self-run” visual effect.
- Target **500–600 RPM** for phenomena such as:
  - Cooling
  - Weight loss
  - Self-rotation

---

## Cultural Significance
The SEG is iconic in alternative energy and anti-gravity research. It combines:
- Mechanical complexity
- Reports of unusual physical effects
- A rich history tied to inventor John Searl’s accounts

Isaiah’s approach focuses on **faithful replication** of Searl’s design before pursuing modifications.

---

**Status**: Active development.  
**Current Version**: 6 (Version 7 in progress).  
**Long-Term Goal**: Multi-ring SEG with potential for autonomous operation and advanced effects.
