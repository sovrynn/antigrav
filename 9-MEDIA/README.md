# Media

Categorized by source.

From now on I'm going to try and move these folders into a specific topic folder, as a subfolder, as long as there is sufficient focus on that specific topic.

There's a lot of stuff in `0-media`.

# Additional video media sources

Check out bitchute and rumble.

Russia probably has lots of good stuff on rutube but it's all in russian unfortunately.

I think China also has stuff but again I can't understand it.

Youtube probably has the least amount of useful stuff.

# Additional search engine sources

Yandex has way less censoring than Google and duckduckgo.
