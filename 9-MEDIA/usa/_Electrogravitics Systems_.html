ELECTROGRAVITICS SYSTEMS<p>

An examination of electrostatic motion, dynamic counterbary and barycentric control.</p><p>

It has been accepted as axiomatic that the way to offset the effects of 
gravity is to use a lifting surface and considerable molecular energy to
 produce a continuously applied force that, for a limited period of 
time, can remain greater than the effects of gravitational attraction. 
The original invention of the glider and evolution of the briefly 
self-sustaining glider, at the turn of the century led to progressive 
advances in power and knowledge. This has been directed to refining the 
classic Wright Brothers' approach. Aircraft design is still 
fundamentally as the Wrights adumbrated it, with wings, body, tails, 
moving or flapping controls, landing gear and so forth. The Wright 
biplane was a powered glider, and all subsequent aircraft, including the
 supersonic jets of the nineteen-fifties are also powered gliders. Only 
one fundamentally different flying principle has so far been adopted 
with varying degrees of success. It is the rotating wing aircraft that 
has led to the jet lifters and vertical pushers, coleopters, ducted fans
 and lift induction turbine propulsion systems.</p><p>

But during these decades there was always the possibility of making 
efforts to discover the nature of gravity from cosmic or quantum theory,
 investigation and observation, with a view to discerning the physical 
properties of aviation's enemy.</p><p>

[Page 2]<br>
It has seemed to Aviation Studies that for some time insufficient 
attention has been directed to this kind of research. If it were 
successful such developments would change the concept of sustentation, 
and confer upon a vehicle qualities that would now be regarded as the 
ultimate in aviation.</p><p>

This report summarizes in simple form the work that has been done and is
 being done in the new field of electrogravitics. It also outlines the 
various possible lines of research into the nature and constituent 
matter of gravity, and how it has changed from Newton to Einstein to the
 modern Hlavaty concept of gravity as an electromagnetic force that may 
be controlled like a light wave.</p><p>

The report also contains an outline of opinions on the feasibility of 
different electrogravitics systems and there is reference to some of the
 barycentric control and electrostatic rigs in operation.</p><p>

Also included is a list of references to electrogravitics in successive 
Aviation Reports since a drive was started by Aviation Studies 
(International) Limited to suggest to aviation business eighteen months 
ago that the rewards of success are too far-reaching to be overlooked, 
especially in view of the hopeful judgement of the most authoritative 
voices in microphysics. Also listed are some relevant patents on 
electrostatics and electrostatic generators in the United States, United
 Kingdom and France.</p><p>

DISCUSSION</p><p>

Electrogravitics might be described as a synthesis of electrostatic 
energy used for propulsion - either vertical propulsion or horizontal or
 both - and gravitics, or dynamic counterbary, in which energy is also 
used to set up a local gravitational force independent of the earth's.</p><p>

Electrostatic energy for propulsion has been predicted as a possible 
means of propulsion in space when the thrust from a neutron motor or ion
 motor would be sufficient in a dragless environment to produce 
astronomical velocities. But the ion motor is not strictly a part of the
 science of electrogravitics, since barycentric control in an 
electrogravitics system is envisaged for a vehicle operating within the 
earth's environment and it is not seen initially for space application. 
Probably large scale space operations would have to await the full 
development of electrogravitics to enable large pieces of equipment to 
be moved out of the region of the earth's strongest gravity effects. So,
 though electrostatic motors were thought of in 1925, electrogravitics 
had its birth after the War, when Townsend Brown sought to improve on 
the various proposals that then existed for electrostatic motors 
sufficiently to produce some visible manifestation of sustained motion. 
Whereas earlier electrostatic tests were essentially pure research, 
Brown's rigs were aimed from the outset at producing a flying article. 
As a private venture he produced evidence of motion using condensers in a
 couple of saucers suspended by arms rotating round a central tower with
 input running down the arms. The massive-k situation was summarized 
subsequently in a report, Project Winterhaven, in 1952. Using the data 
some conclusions were arrived at that might be expected from ten or more
 years of </p><p>

[Page 4]<br>
intensive development - similar to that, for instance, applied to the 
turbine engine. Using a number of assumptions as to the nature of 
gravity, the report postulated a saucer as the basis of a possible 
interceptor with Mach 3 capability. Creation of a local gravitational 
system would confer upon the fighter the sharp-edged changes of 
direction typical of motion in space.</p><p>

The essence of electrogravitics thrust is the use of a very strong 
positive charge on one side of the vehicle and a negative on the other. 
The core of the motor is a condenser and the ability of the condenser to
 hold its charge (the k-number) is the yardstick of performance. With 
air as 1, current dielectrical materials can yield 6 and use of barium 
aluminate can raise this considerably, barium titanium oxide (a baked 
ceramic) can offer 6,000 and there is promise of 30,000, which would be 
sufficient for supersonic speed.</p><p>

The original Brown rig produced 30 fps on a voltage of around 50,000 and
 a small amount of current in the milliamp range. There was no detailed 
explanation of gravity in Project Winterhaven, but it was assumed that 
particle dualism in the subatomic structure of gravity would coincide in
 its effect with the issuing stream of electrons from the electrostatic 
energy source to produce counterbary. The Brown work probably remains a 
realistic approach to the practical realization of electrostatic 
propulsion and sustentation. Whatever may be discovered by the Gravity 
Research Foundation of New Boston a complete understanding and synthetic
 reproduction of gravity is not essential for limited success. The 
electrogravitics saucer can perform the function of a classic lifting 
surface - it produces a pushing effect on the under surface and a 
suction effect on the upper, but, unlike the airfoil, it does not 
require a flow of air to produce the effect.</p><p>

[Page 5]<br>
First attempts at electrogravitics are unlikely to produce counterbary, 
but may lead to development of an electrostatic VTOL vehicle. Even in 
its developed form this might be an advance on the molecular heat engine
 in its capabilities. But hopes in the new science depend on an 
understanding of the close identity of electrostatic motivating forces 
with the source and matter of gravity. It is fortuitous that lift can be
 produced in the traditional fashion and if an understanding of gravity 
remains beyond full practical control, electrostatic lift might be an 
adjunct of some significance to modern thrust producers. Research into 
electrostatics could prove beneficial to turbine development, and heat 
engines in general, in view of the usable electron potential round the 
periphery of any flame. Materials for electrogravitics and especially 
the development of commercial quantities of high-k material is another 
dividend to be obtained from electrostatic research even if it produces 
no counterbary. This is a line of development that Aviation Studies, 
Gravity Research Group is following.</p><p>

One of the interesting aspects of electrogravitics is that a 
breakthrough in almost any part of the broad front of general research 
on the intranuclear processes may be translated into a meaningful 
advance towards the feasibility of electrogravitics systems. This 
demands constant monitoring in the most likely areas of the physics of 
high energy sub-nuclear particles. It is difficult to be overoptimistic 
about the prospects of gaining so complete a grasp of gravity while the 
world's physicists are still engaged in a study of fundamental particles
 - that is to say those that cannot be broken down any more. Fundamental
 particles are still being discovered - the most recent was the 
Segre-Chamberlain-Wiegand attachment to the bevatron, which was used to 
isolate the missing anti-proton, which must - or should be presumed to -
 exist according to Dirac's theory of the electron.</p><p>

[Page 6]<br>
Much of the accepted mathematics of particles would be wrong if the 
anti-proton was proved to be non-existent. Earlier Eddington has listed 
the fundamental particles as:-</p><p>

e. The charge of an electron</p><p>

m. The mass of an electron.</p><p>

M. The mass of a proton.</p><p>

h. Planck's constant</p><p>

c. The velocity of light.</p><p>

G. The constant of gravitation, and</p><p>

[Greek letter, small lambda]. The cosmical constant.</p><p>

It is generally held that no one of these can be inferred from the 
others. But electrons may well disappear from among the fundamental 
particles, though, as Russell says, it is likely that e and m will 
survive. The constants are much more established than the interpretation
 of them and are among the most solid of achievements in modern physics.</p><p>

* * *</p><p>

Gravity may be defined as a small scale departure from Euclidean space 
in the general theory of relativity. The gravitational constant is one 
of four dimensionless constants: first, the mass relation of the nucleon
 and electron. Second is (e*e)/(h*c) [equation form], third, the Compton
 wavelength of the proton, and fourth is the gravitational constant, 
which is the ratio of the electrostatic</p><p>

[Page 7]<br>
to the gravitational attraction between the electron and the proton.</p><p>

One of the stumbling blocks in electrogravitics is the absence of any 
satisfactory theory linking these four dimensionless quantities. Of the 
four, moreover, gravity is decidedly the most complex, since any 
explanation would have to satisfy both cosmic and quantum relations more
 acceptably and intelligibly even than in the unified field theory. A 
gravitational constant of around 10.E-39 [equation form] has emerged 
from quantum research and this has been used as a tool for finding 
theories that could link the two relations. This work is now in full 
progress, and developments have to be watched for the aviation angle. 
Hitherto Dirac, Eddington, Jordan and others have produced differences 
in theory that are too wide to be accepted as consistent. It means 
therefore that (i) without a cosmical basis, and (ii) with an imprecise 
quantum basis and (iii) a vague hypothesis on the interaction, much 
remains still to be discovered. Indeed some say that a single 
interacting theory to link up the dimensionless constants is one of 
three major unresolved basic problems of physics. The other two main 
problems are the extension of quantum theory and a more detailed 
knowledge of the fundamental particles.</p><p>

All this is some distance from Newton, who saw gravity as a force acting
 on a body from a distance, leading to the tendency of bodies to 
accelerate towards each other. He allied this assumption with Euclidean 
geometry, and time was assumed as uniform and acted independently of 
space. Bodies and particles in space normally moved uniformly in 
straight lines according to Newton, and to account for the way they 
sometimes do not do so, he used the idea of a force of gravity acting at
 a distance, in which particles of matter cause in others an 
acceleration proportional to their mass, and inversely proportional to 
the </p><p>

[Page 8]<br>
square of the distance between them.</p><p>

But Einstein showed how the principle of least action, or the so-called 
cosmic laziness means that particles, on the contrary, follow the 
easiest path along geodesic lines and as a result they get readily 
absorbed into space-time. So was born non-linear physics. The classic 
example of non-linear physics is the experiment in bombarding a screen 
with two slits. When both slits are open particles going through are not
 the sum of the two individually but follows a non-linear equation. This
 leads on to wave-particle dualism and that in turn to the Heisenberg 
uncertainty principle in which an increase in accuracy in measurement of
 one physical quantity means decreasing accuracy in measuring the other.
 If time is measured accurately energy calculations will be in error; 
the more accurate the position of a particle is established the less 
certain the velocity will be; and so on. This basic principle of the 
acausality of microphysics affects the study of gravity in the special 
and general theories of relativity. Lack of pictorial image in the 
quantum physics of this interrelationship is a difficulty at the outset 
for those whose minds remain obstinately Euclidean.</p><p>

In the special theory of relativity, space-time is seen only as an 
undefined interval which can be defined in any way that is convenient 
and the Newtonian idea of persistent particles in motion to explain 
gravity cannot be accepted. It must be seen rather as a synthesis of 
forces in a four dimensional continuum, three to establish the position 
and one the time. The general theory of relativity that followed a 
decade later was a geometrical explanation of gravitation in which 
bodies take the geodesic path through space-time. In turn this means 
that instead of the idea of force acting at a distance it is assumed 
that space, time, radiation and particles are linked and variations in 
them from gravity are due rather to the nature of space.</p><p>

[Page 9]<br>
Thus gravity of a body such as the earth instead of pulling objects 
towards it as Newton postulated, is adjusting the characteristics of 
space and, it may be inferred, the quantum mechanics of space in the 
vicinity of the gravitational force. Electrogravitics aims at correcting
 this adjustment to put matter, so to speak, 'at rest'.</p><p>

* * *</p><p>

One of the difficulties in 1954 and 1955 was to get aviation to take 
electrogravitics seriously. The name alone was enough to put people off.
 However, in the trade much progress has been made and now most major 
companies in the United States are interested in counterbary. Groups are
 being organised to study electrostatic and electromagnetic phenomena. 
Most of industry's leaders have made some reference to it. Douglas has 
now stated that it has counterbary on its work agenda but does not 
expect results yet awhile. Hiller has referred to new forms of flying 
platform, Glenn Martin say gravity control could be achieved in six 
years, but they add that it would entail a Manhattan District type of 
effort to bring it about. Sikorsky, one of the pioneers, more or less 
agrees with the Douglas verdict and says that gravity is tangible and 
formidable, but there must be a physical carrier for this immense 
trans-spatial force. This implies that where a physical manifestation 
exists, a physical device can be developed for creating a similar force 
moving in the opposite direction to cancel it. Clarke Electronics state 
they have a rig, and add that in their view the source of gravity's 
force will be understood sooner than some people think. General Electric
 is working on the use of electronic rigs designed to make adjustments 
to gravity - this line of attack has the advantage of using rigs already
 in existence for other defence work. Bell also has an experimental rig 
intended, as </p><p>

[Page 10]<br>
the company puts it, to cancel out gravity, and Lawrence Bell has said 
he is convinced that practical hardware will emerge from current 
programs. Grover Leoning is certain that what he referred to as an 
electro-magnetic contra-gravity mechanism will be developed for 
practical use. Convair is extensively committed to the work with several
 rigs. Lear Inc., autopilot and electronic engineers have a division of 
the company working on gravity research and so also has the Sperry 
division of Sperry-Rand. This list embraces most of the U.S. aircraft 
industry. The remainder, Curtiss-Wright, Lockheed, Boeing and North 
American have not yet declared themselves, but all these four are known 
to be in various stages of study with and without rigs.</p><p>

In addition, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is working on 
gravity, the Gravity Research Foundation of New Boston, the Institute 
for Advanced Study at Princeton, the CalTech Radiation Laboratory, 
Princeton University and the University of North Carolina are all active
 in gravity. Glenn L. Martin is setting up a Research Institute for 
Advanced Study which has a small staff working on gravity research with 
the unified field theory and this group is committed to extensive 
programs of applied research. Many others are also known to be studying 
gravity, some are known also to be planning a general expansion in this 
field, such as in the proposed Institute for Pure Physics at the 
University of North Carolina.</p><p>

A certain amount of work is also going on in Europe. One of the French 
nationalized constructors and one company outside the nationalized 
elements have been making preliminary studies, and a little company 
money has in one case actually been committed. Some work is also going 
on in Britain where rigs are now in existence. Most of it is private 
venture work, such </p><p>

[Page 11]<br>
as that being done by Ed Hull a colleague of Townsend Brown who, as much
 as anybody, introduced Europe to electrogravitics. Aviation Studies' 
Gravity Research Group is doing some work, mainly on k studies, and is 
sponsoring dielectric investigations.</p><p>

One Swedish company and two Canadian companies have been making studies,
 and quite recently the Germans have woken up to the possibilities. 
Several of the companies have started digging out some of the early 
German papers on wave physics. They are almost certain to plan a 
gravitics program. Curiously enough the Germans during the war paid no 
attention to electrogravitics. This is one line of advance that they did
 not pioneer in any way and it was basically a U.S. creation. Townsend 
Brown in electrogravitics is the equivalent of Frank Whittle in gas 
turbines. This German overlooking of electrostatics is even more 
surprising when it is remembered how astonishingly advanced and 
prescient the Germans were in nuclear research. (The modern theory of 
making thermonuclear weapons without plutonium fission initiators 
returns to the original German idea that was dismissed, even ridiculed. 
The Germans never went very far with fission, indeed they doubted that 
this chain would ever be made to work. The German air industry, still in
 the embryo stage, has included electrogravitics among the subjects it 
intends to examine when establishing the policy that the individual 
companies will adopt after the present early stage of foreign licence 
has enabled industry to get abreast of the other countries in aircraft 
development.</p><p>

* * *</p><p>

It is impossible to read through this summary of the widening efforts 
being made to understand the nature of matter of gravity without sharing
 the hope that many groups now have, of major theoretical breakthroughs 
occurring before very long. </p><p>

[Page 12]<br>
Experience in nucleonics has shown that when attempts to win knowledge 
on this scale are made, advances are soon seen. There are a number of 
elements in industry, and some managements, who see gravity as a problem
 for later generations. Many see nothing in it all and they may be 
right. But as said earlier, if Dr. Vaclav Hlavaty thinks gravity is 
potentially controllable that surely should be justification enough, and
 indeed inspiration, for physicists to apply their minds and for 
management to take a risk. Hlavaty is the only man who thinks he can see
 a way of doing the mathematics to demonstrate Einstein's unified field 
theory - something that Einstein himself said was beyond him. Relativity
 and the unified field theory go to the root of electrogravitics and the
 shifts in thinking, the hopes and fears, and a measure of progress is 
to be obtained only in the last resort from men of this stature.</p><p>

Major theoretical breakthroughs to discover the sources of gravity will 
be made by the most advanced intellects using the most advanced research
 tools. Aviation's role is therefore to impress upon physicists of this 
calibre with the urgency of the matter and to aid them with statistical 
and peripheral investigations that will help to clarify the background 
to the central mathematical and physical puzzles. Aviation could also 
assist by recruiting some of these men as advisers. Convair has taken 
the initiative with its recently established panel of advisers on 
nuclear projects, which include Dr. Edward Teller of the University of 
California. At the same time much can be done in development of 
laboratory rigs, condenser research and dielectric development, which do
 not require anything like the same cerebral capacity to get results and
 make a practical contribution</p><p>

As gravity is likely to be linked with the new particles, only the 
highest powered particle accelerators are likely to be of use </p><p>

[Page 13]<br>
in further fundamental knowledge. The country with the biggest tools of 
this kind is in the best position to examine the characteristics of the 
particles and from those countries the greatest advances seem most 
likely.</p><p>

Though the United States has the biggest of the bevatron - the Berkeley 
bevatron is 6.2 bev - the Russians have a 10 bev accelerator in 
construction which, when it is completed, will be the world's largest. 
At Brookhaven a 25 bev instrument is in development which, in turn, will
 be the biggest. Other countries without comparable facilities are of 
course at a great disadvantage from the outset in the contest to 
discover the explanation of gravity. Electrogravitics, moreover, 
unfortunately competes with nuclear studies for its facilities. The 
clearest thinking brains are bound to be attracted to localities where 
the most extensive laboratory equipment exists. So, one way and another,
 results are most likely to come from the major countries with the 
biggest undertakings. Thus the nuclear facilities have a direct bearing 
on the scope for electrogravitics work.</p><p>

The OEEC report in January made the following points:-</p><p>

The U.S. has six to eight entirely different types of reactor in 
operation and many more under construction. Europe has now two different
 types in service.</p><p>

The U.S. has about 30 research reactors plus four in Britain,, two in France.</p><p>

The U.S. has two nuclear-powered marine engines. Europe has none, but the U.K. is building one.</p><p>

[Page 14]<br>
Isotope separation plants for the enrichment of uranium in the U.S. are 
roughly 11 times larger than the European plant in Britain.</p><p>

Europe's only heavy water plant (in Norway) produces somewhat less than one-twentieth of American output.</p><p>

In 1955 the number of technicians employed in nuclear energy work in the
 U.S. was about 15,000; there are about 5,000 in Britain, 1,800 in 
France, and about 19,000 in the rest of Europe. But the working party 
says that pessimistic conclusions should not be drawn from these 
comparisons. European nuclear energy effort is unevenly divided at the 
moment, but some countries have notable achievements to their credit and
 important developments in prospect. The main reason for optimism is 
that, taken as a whole, "Europe's present nuclear effort falls very far 
short of its industrial potential".</p><p>

Though gravity research, such as there has been of it, has been 
unclassified, new principles and information gained from the nuclear 
research facilities that have a vehicle application is expected to be 
withheld.</p><p>

The heart of the problem to understanding gravity is likely to prove to 
be the way in which the very high energy sub-nuclear particles convert 
something, whatever it is, continuously and automatically into the 
tremendous nuclear and electromagnetic forces. Once this key is 
understood, attention can later be directed to finding laboratory means 
of duplicating the process and reversing its force lines in some local 
environment and returning the energy to itself to produce counterbary. 
Looking beyond it seems possible that gravitation will be shown to be a 
part of the universal electro-magnetic processes and controlled </p><p>

[Page 15]<br>
in the same way as a light wave or radio wave. This is a synthesis of 
the Einstein and Hlavaty concepts. Hence it follows that though in its 
initial form the mechanical processes for countering gravity may 
initially be massive to deal with the massive forces involved, 
eventually this could be expected to form some central power generation 
unit. Barycentric control in some required quantity could be passed over
 a distance by a form of radio wave. The prime energy source to energise
 the waves would of course be nuclear in its origins.</p><p>

It is difficult to say which lines of detailed development being 
processed in the immediate future is more likely to yield significant 
results. Perhaps the three most promising are: first, the new attempt by
 the team of men led by Chamberlain working with the Berkeley bevatron 
to find the anti-neutron, and to identify more of the characteristics of
 the anti-proton* and each of the string of high energy particles that 
have been discovered during recent operation at 6. 2 bev.</p><p>

A second line of approach is the United States National Bureau of 
Standards program to pin down with greater accuracy the acceleration 
values of gravity. The presently accepted figure</p><p>

-------------------------------------------------------------<br>
* The reaction is as follows: protons are accelerated to 6.2 bev, and 
directed at a target of copper. When the proton projectile hits a 
neutron in one of the copper atoms the following emerge: the two 
original particles (the projectile and the struck neutron) and a new 
pair of particles, a proton and anti-proton. The anti-proton continues 
briefly until it hits another proton, then both disappear and decay into
 mesons.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>

[Page 16]<br>
of 32.174 feet per second per second is known to be not comprehensive, 
though it has been sufficiently accurate for the limited needs of 
industry hitherto. The NBS program aims at re-determining the strength 
of gravity to within one part of a million. The present method has been 
to hold a ball 16 feet up and chart the elapsed time of descent with 
electronic measuring equipment. The new program is based on the old, but
 with this exceptional degree of accuracy it is naturally immensely more
 difficult and is expected to take 3 years.</p><p>

A third promising line is the new technique of measuring high energy 
particles in motion that was started by the University of California 
last year. This involves passing cosmic rays through a chamber 
containing a mixture of gas, alcohol and water vapour. This creates 
charged atoms, or positive ions, by knocking electrons off the gas 
molecules. A sudden expansion of the chamber results in a condensation 
of water droplets along the track which can be plotted on a photographic
 plate. This method makes it easier to assess the energy of particles 
and to distinguish one from the other. It also helps to establish the 
characteristics of the different types of particle. The relationship 
between these high energy particles and their origin, and 
characteristics have a bearing on electrogravitics in general.</p><p>

So much of what has to be discovered as a necessary preliminary to 
gravity is of no practical use by itself. There is no conceivable use, 
for instance, for the anti-proton, yet its discovery even at a cost of 
$9-million is essential to check the mathematics of the fundamental 
components of matter. Similarly it is necessary to check that all the 
nuclear ghosts that have been postulated theoretically do in fact exist.
 It is not, moreover, sufficient, as in the past, only to observe the 
particles by </p><p>

[Page 17]<br>
radiation counters. In each instance a mechanical maze has to be devised
 and attached to a particle accelerator to trap only the particle 
concerned. Each discovery becomes a wedge for a deeper probe of the 
nucleus. Many of the particles of very high energy have only a fleeting 
existence and collisions that give rise to them from bevatron 
bombardment is a necessary prerequisite to an understanding of gravity. 
There are no shortcuts to this process.</p><p>

Most of the major programs for extending human knowledge
on gravity are being conducted with instruments already in use for 
nuclear research and to this extent the cost of work exclusively on 
gravitational examinations is still not of major proportions. This has 
made it difficult for aviation to gauge the extent of the work in 
progress on gravity research.</p><p>

* * *</p><p>

[Page 18]<br>
CONCLUSIONS</p><p>

1. No attempts to control the magnitude or direction of the earth's 
gravitational force have yet been successful. But if the explanation of 
gravity is to be found in the as yet undetermined characteristics of the
 very high energy particles it is becoming increasingly possible with 
the bevatron to work with the constituent matter of gravity. It is 
therefore reasonable to expect that the new bevatron may, before long, 
be used to demonstrate limited gravitational control.</p><p>

2. An understanding and identification of these particles is on the 
frontiers of human knowledge, and a full assessment of them is one of 
the major unresolved puzzles of the nucleus. An associated problem is to
 discover a theory to account for the cosmic and quantum relations of 
gravity, and a theory to link the gravitational constant with the other 
three dimensionless constants.</p><p>

3. Though the obstacles to an adequate grasp of microphysics still seem 
formidable, the transportation rewards that could follow from 
electrogravitics are as high as can be envisaged. In a weightless 
environment, movement with sharp-edged changes of direction could offer 
unique manoeuvrability.</p><p>

4. Determination of the environment of the anti-proton, discovery</p><p>

[Page 19]<br>
of the anti-neutron and closer examination of the other high energy 
particles are preliminaries to the hypothesis that gravity is one aspect
 of electromagnetism that may eventually be controlled like a wave. When
 the structure of the nucleus becomes clearer, the influence of the 
gravitational force upon the nucleus and the nature of its behaviour in 
space will be more readily understood. This is a great advance on the 
Newtonian concept of gravity acting at a distance.</p><p>

5. Aviation's role appears to be to establish facilities to handle many 
of the peripheral and statistical investigations to help fill in the 
background on electrostatics.</p><p>

6. A distinction has to be made between electrostatic energy for 
propulsion and counterbary. Counterbary is the manipulation of 
gravitational force lines; barycentric control is the adjustment to such
 manipulative capability to produce a stable type of motion suitable for
 transportation.</p><p>

7. Electrostatic energy sufficient to produce low speeds (a few thousand
 dynes, has already been demonstrated. Generation of a region of 
positive electrostatic energy on one side of a plate and negative on the
 other sets up the same lift or propulsion effect as the pressure and 
suction below and above a wing, except that in the case of electrostatic
 application no airflow is necessary.</p><p>

8. Electrostatic energy sufficient to produce a Mach 3 fighter is possible with megavolt energies and a k of over 10,000.</p><p>

[Page 20]<br>
9. k figures of 6,000 have been obtained from some ceramic materials and there are prospects of 30,000.</p><p>

10. Apart from electrogravitics there are other rewards from investment 
in electrostatic equipment. Automation, autonetics and even turbine 
development use similar laboratory facilities.</p><p>

11. Progress in electrogravitics probably awaits a new genius in physics
 who can find a single equation to tie up all the conflicting 
observations and theory on the structure and arrangement of forces and 
the part the high energy particles play in the nucleus. This can occur 
any time, and the chances are improved now that bev. energies are being 
obtained in controlled laboratory conditions.</p><p>

ANTI-GRAVITATION RESEARCH
The basic research and technology behind electro-anti-gravitation is so 
much in its infancy that this is perhaps one field of development where 
not only the methods but the ideas are secret. Nothing therefore can be 
discussed freely at the moment. Very few papers on the subject have been
 prepared so far, and the only schemes that have seen the light of day 
are for pure research into rigs designed to make objects float around 
freely in a box. There are various radio applications, and aviation 
medicine departments have been looking for something that will enable 
them to study the physiological effects on the digestion and organs of 
an environment without gravity. There are however long term aims of a 
more revolutionary nature that envisage equipment that can defeat 
gravity.
Aviation Report 20 August 1954</p><p>

MANAGERIAL POLICY FOR ANTI-GRAVITICS
The prospect of engineers devising gravity-defeating equipment - or 
perhaps it should be described as the creation of pockets of weightless 
environments - does suggest that as a long term policy aircraft 
constructors will be required to place even more emphasis on 
electro-mechanical industrial plant, than is now required for the 
transition from manned to unmanned weapons. Anti-gravitics work is 
therefore likely to go to companies with the biggest electrical 
laboratories and facilities. It is also apparent that anti-gravitics, 
like other advanced sciences, will be initially sponsored for its weapon
 capabilities. There are perhaps two broad ways of using the science - 
one is to postulate the design of advanced type projectiles on their 
best inherent capabilities, and the more critical parameters (that now 
constitutes the design limitation) can be eliminated by anti-gravitics. 
The other, which is a longer term plan, is to create an entirely new 
environment with devices operating entirely under an anti-gravity 
envelope.
Aviation Report 24 August 1954</p><p>

[PAGE 22]<br>
THE GREATER THE EASIER
Propulsion and atomic energy Trends are similar in one respect: the more
 incredible the long term capabilities are, the easier it is to attain 
them. It is strange that the greatest of nature's secrets can be 
harnessed with decreasing industrial effort, but greatly increasing 
mental effort. The Americans went through the industrial torture to 
produce tritium for the first thermonuclear experiment, but later both 
they and the Russians were able to achieve much greater results with the
 help of lithium 6 hydride. The same thing is happening in aviation 
propulsion: the nuclear fuels are promising to be tremendously powerful 
in their effect, but excessively complicated in their application, 
unless there can be some means of direct conversion as in the strontium 
90 cell. But lying behind and beyond the nuclear fuels is the linking of
 electricity to gravity, which is an incomparably more powerful way of 
harnessing energy than the only method known to human intellect at 
present - electricity and magnetism. Perhaps the magic of barium 
aluminium oxide will perform the miracle in propulsion that lithium 6 
hydride has done in the fusion weapon. Certainly it is a well-known 
material in dielectrics, but when one talks of massive-k, one means of 
course five figures. At this early stage it is difficult to relate k to 
Mach numbers with any certainty, but realizable k can, with some kinds 
of arithmetic, produce astounding velocities. They are achievable, 
moreover, with decreasing complexity, indeed the ultimate becomes the 
easiest in terms of engineering, but the most hideous in terms of 
theory. Einstein's general theory of relativity is, naturally, and 
important factor, but some of the postulates appear to depend on the 
unified field theory, which cannot yet be physically checked because 
nobody knows how to do it. Einstein hopes to find a way of doing so 
before he dies.
Aviation Report 31 August 1954</p><p>

GRAVITICS FORMULATIONS
All indications are that there has still been little cognizance of the 
potentialities of electrostatic propulsion and it will be a major</p><p>

[Page 23]<br>
undertaking to re-arrange aircraft plants to conduct large-scale 
research and development into novel forms of dielectric and to improve 
condenser efficiencies and to develop the novel type of materials used 
for fabrication of the primary structure. Some extremely ambitious 
theoretical programs have been submitted and work towards realization of
 a manned vehicle has begun. On the evidence, there are far more 
definite indications that the incredible claims are realizable than 
there was, for instance, in supposing that uranium fission would result 
in a bomb. At least it is known, proof positive, that motion, using 
surprisingly low k, is possible. The fantastic control that again is 
feasible, has not yet been demonstrated, but there is no reason to 
suppose the arithmetic is faulty, especially as it has already led to a 
quite brisk example of actual propulsion.
That first movement was indeed an historic occasion, reminiscent of the 
momentous day at Chicago when the first pile went critical, and the 
phenomenon was scarcely less weird. It is difficult to imagine just 
where a well-organised examination into long term gravitics prospects 
would end. Though a circular platform is electrostatically convenient, 
it does not necessarily follow that the requirements of control by 
differential changes would be the same. Perhaps the strangest part of 
this whole chapter is how the public managed to foresee the concept 
though not of course the theoretical principles that gave rise to it, 
before physical tests confirmed that the mathematics was right. It is 
interesting also that there is no point of contact between the 
conventional science of aviation and the New: it is a radical offshoot 
with no common principles. Aerodynamics, structures, heat engines, 
flapping controls, and all the rest of aviation is part of what might be
 called the Wright Brothers era - even the Mach 2.5 thermal barrier 
piercers are still Wright Brothers concepts, in the sense that they fly 
and they stall, and they run out of fuel after a short while, and they 
defy the earth's pull for a short while. Thus this century will be 
divided into two parts - almost to the day. The first half belonged to 
the Wright Brothers who foresaw nearly all the basic issues in which 
gravity was the bitter foe. In part of the second half gravity will be 
the great provider. Electrical energy, rather irrelevant for propulsion 
in</p><p>

[Page 24]<br>
the first half becomes a kind of catalyst to motion, in the second half of the century.
Aviation Report 7 September 1954</p><p>

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS PARADOX
Realization of electro-static propulsion seems to depend on two 
theoretical twists and two practical ones. The two theoretical puzzles 
are: first, how to make a condenser the centre of a propulsion system, 
and second is how to link the condenser system with the gravitational 
field. There is a third problem, but it is some way off yet, which is 
how to manipulate kva for control in all three axes as well as for 
propulsion and lift. The two practical tricks are first how, with say a 
Mach 3 weapon in mind, to handle 50,000 kva within the envelope of a 
thin pancake of 35 feet in diameter and second how to generate such 
power from within so small a space. The electrical power in a small 
aircraft is more than is a fair sized community the analogy being that a
 single rocketjet can provide as much power as can be obtained from the 
Hoover Dam. It will naturally take as long to develop electro-static 
propulsion as it has taken to coax the enormous power outputs from heat 
engines. True there might be a flame in the electro-gravitic propulsion 
system, but it would not be a heat engine - the temperature of the flame
 would be incidental to the function of the chemical burning process.
The curious thing is that though electro-static propulsion is the 
antithesis of magnetism,* Einstein's unified field theory is an attempt 
to link gravitation with electro-magnetism. This all-embracing theory 
goes on logically from the general theory of relativity, that gives an 
ingenious geometrical interpretation of the concept of force which is 
mathematically consistent with gravitation but fails in the case of 
electro-magnetism, while the special theory of relativity is concerned 
with the relationship between mass and energy. The general theory of 
relativity fails to account for electro-magnetism because the forces are
 proportional to the charge and not to the mass. The unified field 
theory is one of a number of attempts that have been made to bridge this
 gap, but it is baffling to imagine how it could ever be observed. 
Einstein himself thinks it is virtually impossible. However Hlavaty 
claims now to have solved the equations by assuming that gravitation is a
 manifestation of electro-magnetism.
This being so it is all the more incredible that electro-static 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Though in a sense this is true, it is better expressed in the body of 
this report than it was here in 1954.</p><p>

[Page 25]<br>
propulsion (with kva for convenience fed into the system and not 
self-generated) has actually been demonstrated. It may be that to apply 
all this very abstruse physics to aviation it will be necessary to 
accept that the theory is more important than this or that 
interpretation of it. This is how the physical constants, which are now 
regarded as among the most solid of achievements in modern physics, have
 become workable, and accepted. Certainly all normal instincts would 
support the Einstein series of postulations, and if this is so it is a 
matter of conjecture where it will lead in the long term future of the 
electro-gravitic science.
Aviation Report 10 September 1954</p><p>

ELECTRO-GRAVITIC PROPULSION SITUATION
Under the terms of Project Winterhaven the proposals to develop 
electro-gravitics to the point of realizing a Mach 3 combat type disc 
were not far short of the extensive effort that was planned for the 
Manhattan District.* Indeed the drive to develop the new prime mover is 
in some respects rather similar to the experiments that led to the 
release of nuclear energy in the sense that both involve fantastic 
mathematical capacity and both are sciences so new that other allied 
sciences cannot be of very much guide. In the past two years since the 
principle of motion by means of massive-k was first demonstrated on a 
test rig, progress has been slow. But the indications are now that the 
Pentagon is ready to sponsor a range of devices help further knowledge. 
In effect the new family of TVs would be on the same tremendous scope 
that was envisaged by the X-1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and D.558s that were all 
created for the purpose of destroying the sound barrier - which they 
effectively did, but it is a process that is taking ten solid years of 
hard work to complete. (Now after 7 years the X-2 has yet to start its 
tests and the X-3 is still in performance testing stage). Tentative 
targets now being set anticipate that the first disc should be complete 
before 1960 and it would take the whole of the 'sixties to develop it 
properly, even though some combat things might be available ten years 
from now.
One thing seems certain at this stage, that the companies likely to 
dominate the science will be those with the biggest

computors to work out the ramifications of the basic theory. Douglas is 
easily the world's leader in computor capacity, followed by Lockheed and
 Convair. The frame incidentally is indivisible from the engine". If 
there is to be any division of responsibility it would be that the 
engine industry might become responsible for providing the electrostatic
 energy (by, it is thought, a kind of flame) and the frame maker for the
 condenser assembly which is the core of the main structure.
Aviation Report 12 October 1954</p><p>

GRAVITICS STUDY WIDENING
The French are now understood to be pondering the most effective way of 
entering the field of electro-gravitic propulsion systems. But not least
 of the difficulties is to know just where to begin. There are 
practically no patents so far that throw very much light on the 
mathematics of the relation between electricity and gravity. There is, 
of course, a large number of patents on the general subject of motion 
and force, and some of these may prove to have some application. There 
is, however, a series of working postulations embodied in the original 
Project Winterhaven, but no real attempt has been made in the working 
papers to go into the detailed engineering. All that had actually been 
achieved up to just under a year ago was a series of fairly accurate 
extrapolations from the sketchy data that has so far been actually 
observed. The extrapolation of 50 mph to 1,800 mph, however, (which is 
what the present hopes and aspirations amount to) is bound to be a 
rather vague exercise. This explains American private views that nothing
 can be reasonably expected from the science yet awhile. Meanwhile, the 
NACA is active, and nearly all the Universities are doing work that 
borders close to what is involved here, and something fruitful is likely
 to turn up before very long.
Aviation Report 19 October 1954</p><p>

GRAVITICS STEPS 
Specification writers seem to be still rather stumped to know what to ask for in the very hazy science of electro-gravitic</p><p>

[Page 27]<br>
propelled vehicles. They are at present faced with having to plan the 
first family of things - first of these is the most realistic type of 
operational test rig, and second the first type of test vehicle. In turn
 this would lead to sponsoring of a combat disc. The preliminary test 
rigs which gave only feeble propulsion have been somewhat improved, but 
of course the speeds reached so far are only those more associated with 
what is attained on the roads rather than in the air. But propulsion is 
now known to be possible, so it is a matter of feeding enough KVA into 
condensers with better k figures. 50,000 is a magic figure for the 
combat saucer - it is this amount of KVA and this amount of k that can 
be translated into Mach 3 speeds.
Meanwhile Glenn Martin now feels ready to say in public that they are 
examining the unified field theory to see what can be done. It would 
probably be truer to say that Martin and other companies are now looking
 for men who can make some kind of sense out of Einstein's equations. 
There's nobody in the air industry at present with the faintest idea of 
what it is all about. Also, just as necessary, companies have somehow to
 find administrators who know enough of the mathematics to be able to 
guess what kind of industrial investment is likely to be necessary for 
the company to secure the most rewarding prime contracts in the new 
science. This again is not so easy since much of the mathematics just 
cannot be translated into words. You either understand the figures, or 
you cannot ever have it explained to you. This is rather new because 
even things like indeterminacy in quantum mechanics can be more or less 
put into words. 
Perhaps the main thing for management to bear in mind in recruiting men 
is that essentially electro-gravitics is a branch of wave technology and
 much of it starts with Planck's dimensions of action, energy and time, 
and some of this is among the most firm and least controversial sections
 of modern atomic physics.
Aviation Report 19 November 1954.</p><p>

ELECTROGRAVITICS PUZZLE
Back in 1948 and 49, the public in the U.S. had a surprisingly clear 
idea of what a flying saucer should, or could, do. There has never at 
any time been any realistic explanation of </p><p>

[Page 28]<br>
what propulsion agency could make it do those things, but its ability to
 move within its own gravitation field was presupposed from its 
manoeuvrability. Yet all this was at least two years before 
electro-static energy was shown to produce propulsion. It is curious 
that the public were so ahead of the empiricists on this occasion, and 
there are two possible explanations. One is that optical illusions or 
atmospheric phenomena offered a preconceived idea of how the ultimate 
aviation device ought to work. The other explanation might be that this 
was a recrudescence of Jung's theory of the Universal Mind which moves 
up and down in relation to the capabilities of the highest intellects 
and this may be a case of it reaching a very high peak of perception.
But for the air industries to realize an electro-gravitic aircraft means
 a return to basic principles in nuclear physics, and a re-examination 
of much in wave technology that has hitherto been taken for granted. 
Anything that goes any way towards proving the unified field theory will
 have as great a bearing on electro-gravitics efforts as on the 
furtherance of nuclear power generally. But the aircraft industry might 
as well face up to the fact that priorities will in the end be competing
 with the existing nuclear science commitments. The fact that 
electro-gravitics has important applications other than for a weapon 
will however strengthen the case for governments to get in on the work 
going on. 
Aviation Report 28 January 1955</p><p>

MANAGEMENT NOTE FOR ELECTRO-GRAVITICS
The gas turbine engine produced two new companies in the U.S. engine 
field and they have, between them, at various times offered the 
traditional primes rather formidable competition. Indeed GE at this 
moment has, in the view of some, taken the Number Two position. In 
Britain no new firms managed to get a footing but one, Metro-Vick, might
 have done if it had put its whole energies into the business. It is on 
the whole unfortunate for Britain that no bright newcomer has been able 
to screw up competition in the engine field as English Electric have 
done in the airframe business.</p><p>

[Page 29]<br>
Unlike the turbine engine, electro-gravitics is not just a new 
propulsion system, it is a new mode of thought in aviation and 
communications, and it is something that may become all-embracing. 
Theoretical studies of the science unfortunately have to extend right 
down to the mathematics of the meson and there is no escape from that. 
But the relevant facts wrung from the nature of the nuclear structure 
will have their impact on the propulsion system, the airframe and also 
its guidance. The airframe, as such, would not exist, and what is now a 
complicated stressed structure becomes some convenient form of hard 
envelope. New companies therefore who would like to see themselves as 
major defence prime contractors in ten or fifteen years time are the 
ones most likely to stimulate development. Several typical companies in 
Britain and the U.S. come to mind - outfits like AiResearch, Raytheon, 
Plessey in England, Rotax and others. But the companies have to face a 
decade of costly research into theoretical physics and it means a great 
deal of trust. Companies are mostly overloaded already and they cannot 
afford it, but when they sit down and think about the matter they can 
scarcely avoid the conclusion that they cannot afford not to be in at 
the beginning.
Aviation Report 8 February 1955</p><p>

ELECTRO-GRAVITICS BREAKTHROUGHS
Lawrence Bell said last week he thought that the tempo of development 
leading to the use of nuclear fuels and anti-gravitational vehicles (he 
meant presumably ones that create their own gravitational field 
independently of the earth's) would accelerate. He added that the 
breakthroughs now feasible will advance their introduction ahead of the 
time it has taken to develop the turbojet to its present pitch. Beyond 
the thermal barrier was a radiation barrier, and he might have added 
ozone poisoning and meteorite hazards, and beyond that again a time 
barrier. Time however is not a single calculable entity and Einstein has
 taught that an absolute barrier to aviation is the environmental 
barrier in which there are physical limits to any kind of movement from 
one point in space-time continuum to another. Bell (the company not the 
man) have a reputation as</p><p>

[Page 30]<br>
experimentalists and are not so earthy as some of the other U.S. 
companies; so while this first judgement on progress with 
electrogravitics is interesting, further word is awaited from the other 
major elements of the air business. Most of the companies are now 
studying several forms of propulsion without heat engines though it is 
early days yet to determine which method will see the light of day 
first. Procurement will open out because the capabilities of such 
aircraft are immeasurably greater than those envisaged with any known 
form of engine.
Aviation Report 15 July 1955</p><p>

THERMONUCLEAR-ELECTROGRAVITICS INTERACTION
The point has been made that the most likely way of achieving the 
comparatively low fusion heat needed - l,000,000 degrees provided it can
 be sustained (which it cannot be in fission for more than a microsecond
 or two of time) - is by use of a linear accelerator. The concentration 
of energy that may be obtained when accelerators are rigged in certain 
ways make the production of very high temperatures feasible but whether 
they could be concentrated enough to avoid a thermal heat problem 
remains to be seen. It has also been suggested that linear accelerators 
would be the way to develop the high electrical energies needed for 
creation of local gravitational systems. It is possible therefore to 
imagine that the central core of a future air vehicle might be a linear 
accelerator which would create a local weightless state by use of 
electrostatic energy and turn heat into energy without chemical 
processes for propulsion. Eventually - towards the end of this century -
 the linear accelerator itself would not be required and a ground 
generating plant would transmit the necessary energy for both purposes 
by wave propagation.
Aviation Report 30 August 1955</p><p>

POINT ABOUT THERMONUCLEAR REACTION REACTORS
The 20 year estimate by the AEC last week that lies between present research frontiers and the fusion reactor</p><p>

[Page 31]<br>
probably refers to the time it will take to tap fusion heat. But it may 
be thought that rather than use the molecular and chemical processes of 
twisting heat into thrust it would be more appropriate to use the now 
heat source in conjunction with some form of nuclear thrust producer 
which would be in the form of electrostatic energy. The first two Boeing
 nuclearjet prototypes now under way are being designed to take either 
molecular jets or nuclear jets in case the latter are held up for one 
reason or another. But the change from molecular to direct nuclear 
thrust production in conjunction with the thermonuclear reactor is 
likely to make the aircraft designed around the latter a totally 
different breed of cat. It is also expected to take longer than two 
decades, though younger executives in trade might expect to live to see a
 prototype.
Aviation Report 14 October 1955</p><p>

ELECTROGRAVITICS FEASIBILITY
Opinion on the prospects of using electrostatic energy for propulsion, 
and eventually for creation of a local gravitational field isolated from
 the earth's has naturally polarized into the two opposite extremes. 
There are those who say it is nonsense from start to finish, and those 
who are satisfied from performance already physically manifest that it 
is possible and will produce air vehicles with absolute capabilities and
 no moving parts. The feasibility of a Mach 3 fighter (the present aim 
in studies) is dependent on a rather large k extrapolation, considering 
the pair of saucers that have physically demonstrated the principle only
 a achieved a speed of some 30 fps. But, and this is important, they 
have attained a working velocity using very inefficient (even by 
to-day's knowledge) form of condenser complex. These humble beginnings 
are surely as hopeful as Whittle's early postulations.
It was, by the way, largely due to the early references in Aviation 
Report that work is gathering momentum in the U.S. Similar studies are 
beginning in France, and in England some men are on the job full time.
Aviation Report 15 November 1955</p><p>

[Page 32]<br>
ELECTRO-GRAVITICS EFFORT WIDENING
Companies studying the implications of gravitics are said in a new 
statement, to include Glenn Martin, Convair, Sperry-Rand, Sikorsky, 
Bell, Lear Inc. and Clark Electronics. Other companies who have 
previously evinced interest include Lockheed Douglas and Hiller. The 
remainder are not disinterested, but have not given public support to 
the new science - which is widening all the time. The approach in the 
U.S. is in a sense more ambitious than might have been expected. The 
logical approach, which has been suggested by Aviation Studies, is to 
concentrate on improving the output of electrostatic rigs in existence 
that are known to be able to provide thrust. The aim would be to 
concentrate on electrostatics for propulsion first and widen the 
practical engineering to include establishment of local gravity 
forcelines, independent of those of the earth's, to provide unfettered 
vertical movement as and when the mathematics develops.</p><p>

However, the U.S. approach is rather to put money into fundamental 
theoretical physics of gravitation in an effort first to create the 
local gravitation field. Working rigs would follow in the wake of the 
basic discoveries. Probably the correct course would be to sponsor both 
approaches, and it is now time that the military stepped in with big 
funds. The trouble about the idealistic approach to gravity is that the 
aircraft companies do not have the men to conduct such work. There is 
every expectation in any case that the companies likely to find the 
answers lie outside the aviation field. These would emerge as the 
masters of aviation in its broadest sense.
The feeling is therefore that a company like A. T. &amp; T. is most 
likely to be first in this field. This giant company (unknown in the air
 and weapons field) has already revolutionized modern warfare with the 
development of the junction transistor and is expected to find the final
 answers to absolute vehicle levitation. This therefore is where the 
bulk of the sponsoring money should go.
