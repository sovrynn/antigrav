    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">[An unidentified article
      published in the 1970s; author unknown]</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Gianni A. Dotto was born in Venice, son of a prominent
      engineer who was the designer of two hydro-electric generating
      plants on both the American and Canadian sides of Niagara Falls.
      His father was an Italian Marquis and since Gianni is the eldest
      son, he would have inherited the title had he not become an
      American citizen. The family is directly descended form Galileo
      and the Galileo coat of arms has been adopted for use as the
      Foundation's letterhead. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Before World War II, Gianni had received flight training
      but Mussolini never did trust the Dotto family so Gianni was
      drafted into the Italian Army as a paratrooper. When Italy
      surrendered, Gianni was able to join the American Air Force as a
      fighter pilot in time to participate in numerous engagements
      against the German Messerschmidts before the war ended. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>After the war, Gianni became the head of the racing
      division of Alfa-Romero and started race-driving cars of his own
      design. His racing career ended when his wife, Renata, handed him
      an ultimatum: "Either give up racing or me". He is a prolific
      inventor as he is the owner of many Italian patents bearing on the
      automotive industry and, subsequently, just as many American
      patents. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>He is highly educated, holding the Italian equivalent of
      an American PhD in nuclear physics from Milan University and the
      same degree in mechanical engineering from another Italian
      technical school. Subsequently, he received a degree in electrical
      engineering from Wayne University of Detroit. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>While Gianni was teaching at Milan University, the
      medical school requested the services of a physicist to
      collaborate with the doctors on a research project. This started
      him on a career as a "bio-physicist" --- that is, a physicist that
      specializes in the area of the science of physics that bears on
      the human body. This embraces an amazingly wide field, as it has
      to do with the magnetic fields, polarity, the various vibrations
      and pulsations generated by the brain and, of course, the effect
      of the many facets of nuclear fission on the human body. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It was there that Gianni discovered that magnetic fields
      induced by an electric coil and by permanent magnets had a small
      effect on the human body, but that a mild magnetic filed created
      by adjacent hot and cold areas was definitely beneficial. In other
      words, the thermal unbalance created a magnetic field that matched
      the natural field of the human body. The development of the "Dotto
      Ring" was Gianni's practicable way of producing a piece of
      equipment that could impress the beneficial magnetic field on the
      body. The ring is 27 inches in diameter, made of heavy copper and
      has an adjacent heated and refrigerated area. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Through the ring he has reproduced in a compact,
      accessible form the same magnetic environment responsible for the
      good health and longevity of the Hunza people. Visitors to
      Hunzaland always attribute this great advantage to their diet, air
      and water, but Gianni could not accept this belief because there
      are many valleys in the Himalaya Mountains where the diet, air and
      water are similar to that of the Hunzas' but the inhabitants of
      these valleys are devoid of the same health and longevity
      manifestations as in Hunza. With the principle of the Dotto Ring
      in mind, a panoramic view of the Hunza valley makes Gianni's
      theory easy to understand. At the head of the valley there is a
      huge glacier or ice mass and in the valley itself the temperature
      becomes quite warm, thus creating the thermal unbalance mentioned
      previously and which is recreated in the principle of the Dotto
      Ring. When a Hunza travels across his valley, he receives a
      beneficial treatment from a mild magnetic field. The similarity of
      the Dotto Ring to the Hunza valley is interesting to say the
      least. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Gianni has written what he describes as a "simple
      explanation of just how the ring works". Simple to a physicist
      perhaps, but difficult for a layman to understand; consequently,
      the following preliminary explanation has been outlined for the
      purpose of clarification: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The nucleus of each cell contains a material known as
      the DNA, which is an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid. This
      substance contains the life or genetic code. The presence and
      function of the DNA has long been suspected by our
      doctor-scientists and had been presented as a theory, but it was
      only about 7 years ago with the development of the electron
      microscope that the presence of the DNA was confirmed. Now it can
      be seen, photographed and sketched. Imagine a tiny ladder twisted
      together in a coil fashion until the unit forms a double helix.
      The DNA is pliable and rubbery an is never still as it constantly
      vibrates in resonance with brain signals and even outside
      influences. The DNA is polarized, with one end being plus and the
      other being minus. A healthy DNS reproduces healthy cells and aids
      the body to naturally overcome and eliminate an invasion of
      bacteria or toxins. This, of course, adds up to good health. When
      the body is within the beneficial magnetic field of the Dotto
      Ring, polarization of the DNA is oriented properly and resonance
      is synchronized to that of a healthy cell. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Important animal tests required by the medial
      authorities have been underway for the past three years,
      culminating in seven official tests that were conducted under
      rigidly controlled conditions. The tests were conducted by Prof.
      Gerald Willis (Biology Professor at the University of Dayton) and
      Dr. Robert Zipf, PhD. Dr. Zipf is owner of a group of biological
      laboratories and has been Coroner of Montgomery Country (OH) for
      20 years. The room in which the tests were conducted was kept
      under triple lock so that only Prof. Willis had access to the
      area. Dr. Zipf performed the pathology on the test mice. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Mice (6 per cage and 8 per cage per test) were injected
      with cancer cells, In three tests, C-27 cancer cells were used and
      in two other tests, Krib type carcinoma cells were used. The most
      recent tests were conducted in mice that had induced leukemia. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Results have been very good indeed. The untreated mice
      died in about 7 days while with few exception the treated mice
      survived. When the treated mice were finally sacrificed, they
      showed no evidence of cancer. These tests, as well as actual
      experience using the ring on the human body, prove definitely that
      there are no side effects. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Gianni Dotto has now had 5 years of experience in the
      use of his ring. For the past 2 years the ring has been in
      operation in his Bio-Physics Laboratory (Kettering, OH). Results
      have been uniformly good. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Following is the scientific paper prepared by Gianni
      Dotto. </blockquote>
    <hr width="67108863" align="center">
    <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><a name="2"></a><font size="4"><b>Background of the Theory of the Dotto Ring</b></font></blockquote>
    <blockquote>Most of the external physical factors which have been
      implicated in the evolution of life are of an electromagnetic
      nature. It has now been established that throughout the reviewable
      geological period the biosphere has been a region of
      electromagnetic fields and radiations of all the frequencies known
      to us --- from slow periodic variations to the earth's magnetic
      field and electric fields to gamma rays. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is fundamentally possible on the basis of general
      considerations that any of the ranges of the electromagnetic
      spectrum could have played some role in the evolution of life and
      are involved in the vital processes of organisms. This has already
      been demonstrated for a considerable region of the spectrum; for
      electromagnetic radiations in the infrared to ultraviolet range
      (photobiology) and from x-rays (radiobiology). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The situation is different with the vast remaining
      region of the spectrum, which includes electromagnetic fields
      (EMFs) of super-high, ultra-high, high, low, and infra-low
      frequencies. Experimental investigations and theoretical
      considerations suggest that EMFs can have a significant biological
      action only when their intensity is fairly high and that such
      action can be due to only one process: conversion of
      electromagnetic energy to heat or vice versa. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>There is an increasing amount of reliable experimental
      data which indicates that EMFs can have non-thermal effects and
      that living organisms of diverse species, from unicellular
      organisms to man, are extremely sensitive to EMFs. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Finally, it has been found that very weak natural EMFs
      can have non-thermal effects and that living organisms of diverse
      species, from unicellular organisms to man, are extremely
      sensitive to EMFs. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Finally, it has been found that very weak natural EMFs
      can affect organisms of various species. All this indicates the
      necessity for a fundamentally new approach to the problem of the
      biological action of EMFs and for the need to reconsider the
      question of the possible role of EMFs in the vital activity of
      organisms (Parin). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is believed that my work is not the first attempt at
      such an approach to the problem on the basis of the concept of the
      informational role of EMFs in the evolution and vital activity of
      organisms. There are three kinds of "biological activity of EMFs":
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) The effect of natural environment EMFs on the
      regulation of vital processes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) The role of internal fields in the organism in the
      coordination of physiological processes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) The interaction between organisms by means of EMFs.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is not sufficient to consider only the energetic
      aspect of the interaction of EMFs with biological systems and a
      portion of my past investigations have dealt with the
      informational functions of these fields in living nature. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>I have constructed equipment necessary to conduct my
      cancer research. A substantial data bank of case histories has
      been accumulated. Not all case histories are well defined, but
      general results are amazingly good. This is understandable,
      however, since I am in the process of establishing the first
      formulation of a new biological problem. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>My concept of the information functions of EMFs in
      living organisms and the hypothesis expresses in this respect will
      undoubtedly rouse interest in a wide circle of the medical
      readers. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The objectives of this research project are: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) Prove that the human body responds favorably when
      exposed to EMFs. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) Establish what types of EMFs are more effective. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) Determine the specific frequency of EMFs for
      different types of disease. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Working Theory of the Dotto Ring</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>There are four basic, major but disparate theories
      explaining the development of cancerous tissue. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) Virus (theory supported by scientists of
      Sloan-Kettering, NY). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) Low negative voltage across cancer cell skin (Cone,
      NASA). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) Excess of base pairs per turn on DNA double helix
      (Dotto). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(4) Alteration of the DNA code due to a certain type of
      virus (Temin). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The first theory would be correct if we are to accept
      the hypothesis that all the viruses of the four groups responsible
      for the manufacture of the nuclei (even if similar in size, shape,
      and crystal form) are tuned to a different frequency, according to
      the location in the human body of different groups of cells. In
      this case, a virus out of position can create the Temin phenomena
      of mixing up the sequence of the DNA code. If this is the case,
      the theory that someday immunization against cancer will be as
      simple as polio immunization is unrealistic. The variety of cancer
      immunization viruses will be in the numerical magnitude of
      trillions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Theory #2 (Cone, NASA) would be acceptable if we
      consider a cancerous cell a parasite cell, to some extent. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>According to Theory #3 (Dotto), the magnetic charge of
      the genetic code is maintained at the proper level by the
      electrical property of the double helix, which functions as a
      common transformer; where voltage of the primary and the secondary
      winding is proportional to the number of turns of the coils. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If the DNA double helix of a cancer cell has a lesser
      number of turns than the DNA double helix of a normal cell, then
      the voltage across the cancer cell must be lower than the voltage
      across the normal cell; consequently, the number of base pairs per
      turn will be greater. Greater base pairs per turn of the double
      helix and eagerness of completing the outer electron orbiting of
      the atomic structure of the nucleus leads to a greater capacity of
      reproduction of the DNA. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The second and third theories then are similar in
      principle but explained from a different observer's viewpoint. One
      explains the result; the other explains the cause. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Theory #4 (Temin) is a consequence of Theory #1
      (Sloan-Kettering, NY) --- however, with an incorrect
      interpretation of the phenomena. Due to the tremendous variety of
      viruses classified in 8 distinct groups, 4 RNA types and 4 DNA
      types, there is no way in which to resolve the immunization
      capability unless the immunization factor can be obtained with the
      natural method described in the second Dotto patent application #
      42,301, filed June 1, 1970: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Milk taken from the right breast of a nursing mother is
      maintained separate from the milk taken from the left breast. On
      high-G centrifuge, viruses are separated from proteins and fats.
      Immunization will start with oral or injection methods, by using
      RNA type viruses from the right breast and repeated tow months
      later with DNA type viruses from the left breast. In the human
      breast, there are all the variety of viruses necessary for the
      immunization." </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Why, then, the electronic reactor (Dotto Ring Device)
      and not chemistry to resolve the problem? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To begin with: in the normal process of life of a
      healthy body, when a new cell is produced, the orbital electron
      spinning of the new cell assumes a direction opposite to one of
      the mother cell, in order to maintain the mutual attraction. When
      the increasing kinetic electron energy of the new cells overcome
      the energy of the mother cell, the orbital electron spinning of
      the mother cell is forced to change direction and mutual rejection
      occurs. In the process, the entire energy of the mother cell
      collapses (in the same fashion as a transformer core) and its
      energy is absorbed entirely by the new cells. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>However, if the energy potential and derived magnetic
      field in the human body is diminished or unbalanced, the new cell
      loses the body support to increasing kinetic energy and the dying
      cell never changes direction electron spinning. The dying cell
      then maintains enough residual energy to be attracted by the new
      born cell and becomes its parasite. The DNA of the new cell now
      must perform double work; support the new cell and the parasite
      cell, with the result that the life span of the new DNA will be
      shortened. The oncoming new DNA must now have enough energy to
      support the dying cell and the parasite cell. Furthermore, it
      cannot rely any longer on the body support due to a weak or
      unbalanced magnetic field. In a desperate attempt to be liberated
      of the parasite cell, the DNA sends a message to the enzymes. Most
      of the time the enzymes are too busy in the assimilation of the
      processed food of modern civilization with the result that the DNA
      of the new cell has to support two parasite cells, and so on… </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When the combined energy of the parasite cells becomes
      greater than the energy of the new cell, the new DNA loses control
      over the RNA in the formation of protein. The RNAs are then formed
      by the combined genetic code of the DNA of the parasite cells.
      This will occur when enough or greater genetic code in the
      summation of parasite cells overcomes the control of the normal
      DNA. The DNA code so completed may have all the information
      necessary to sustain life, but in the wrong sequential order; and
      a new strange life in the life is born. This phenomenon is known
      as cancer. From the above explanation it is quite obvious that a
      cell in the dying process must lose its entire energy to be
      removed by the blood or lymphatic system; otherwise the body must
      have enough enzyme supply to destroy the cells before they become
      parasites. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To prevent and control cancer, several methods can be
      applied: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) Magnetic intensity, homogeneity, and orientation in
      the human body must always be maintained at the optimum level. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) Mineral balance and proper distribution are
      essential. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>That is, the cell needs copper to convert AC impulse
      from the nervous system to DC energy. This energy is necessary to
      maintain the DNA in the proper oscillatory frequency. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Aluminum and zinc are necessary to maintain the voltage
      level. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Iron is necessary to accumulate inductive energy EMF. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The most important elements, magnesium and oxygen, are
      necessary to insure the total collapsing effect of the iron when
      the electron orbital spinning in the nucleus reverses. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In modern civilization, where the entire environmental
      surrounding is bound to destroy humanity, the above conditions are
      essential for survival. While natural food consumption maintains
      the proper mineral balance, and may maintain the enzyme proportion
      in the high level, the most important factor is to supply the body
      with enough energy to maintain the magnetic field as described
      above. However, we must clarify that we call the magnetic force
      any energy capable of attracting or repelling matter. In reality,
      there are four different types of magnetic force, each one caused
      by a different physical phenomenon. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) <i>Permanent Magnet</i> ~ If we try to magnetize a
      copper bar, we will never succeed because in the copper the outer
      orbit of the electrons increases the kinetic energy without
      shifting electrons from one orbit to another. We will obtain the
      same effect if we try to magnetize a bar of nickel. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now let's take a copper-nickel alloy, such as alnickel,
      and expose it to the EMF of a high inductive coil. The directional
      spinning of the electrons' orbit in the nickel does not change,
      but the orbital spinning of the electrons in the copper reverses
      its direction. Result: any atom of nickel strongly attracts an
      atom of copper, creating a bipole. The energy summation of all
      bipoles combined creates one of the strongest permanent magnets on
      the market --- alnickel V. Every permanent magnet then must be
      composed of at least two different atoms, one of which is willing
      to change the orbital spinning direction of the electrons. This
      type of permanent magnet is not recommended for any therapeutic
      purpose for the human body. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>While in mice tests this type of permanent magnet seems
      to be very promising (Barnothy, Pressman, etc.), the physical
      working principle is similar to the H bonds' attraction that holds
      together the DNA. The tumor in the mouse disappears due to the
      disassembly of the DNA in the affected cell by the demagnetization
      effect of the H bonds. At the same time the genetic code of the
      healthy cell is also altered and the consequences in the following
      generations could be very undesirable. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) <i>Electromagnet</i> ~ This type of magnetic field
      obeys the third Newtonian law of motion (to every action there is
      always an equal and opposite reaction). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If an iron bar is inserted in the center of an inductive
      coil, every electron traveling along the coil wire forces one
      electron in the iron bar to travel in the opposite direction. This
      type of magnetic field is not recommended for any therapeutic
      purposes. On the contrary, it has been proved to be detrimental
      even in mice tests. Electrons flowing along the magnetic coil will
      shift electrons from one part of the body to another. In this
      process RNA type viruses of negative polarity will be shifted from
      diseased cells to healthy cells in the same fashion as electrons.
      Furthermore, the shifting of electrons deprives the healthy cells
      of the energy necessary to support life and will produce severe
      side effects of dizziness that will last for several days
      thereafter. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) <i>Electrostatic Attraction</i> ~ When we rub a bar
      of hard rubber or a bar of amber, one acquires electrons in excess
      and the other loses electron from the outer shell orbit.
      Consequently, one will attract particles rich in electrons and the
      other will attract particles poor of electrons. This type of
      magnetic attraction is not recommended because one will weaken the
      energy of the normal cells; the other will increase the negative
      potential of the skin of the cancer cell, thus facilitating the
      growth of the cancer. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(4) <i>Thermomagnetic Field</i> ~ The thermomagnetic
      field is the product of the Thompson-Peltier effects combined,
      known in physics as the Seebeck Effect. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The thermomagnetic field is responsible for the general
      gravitation system: heat (sun) attracts cool (planet) and vice
      versa. According to Dotto law: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>F = G M'M"/[sq root of] 1-(K'/Pamu/K"/Eamu 4/3 pi)<sup>2</sup>
      / R<sup>2</sup> / [sq. root of]1-(K"/K1)<sup>2</sup> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>K' = warmest body; K" = coolest body; Pamu = 1.00759;
      Eamu = 0.00055; G = 6.66 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>
      sec<sup>-2</sup> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Newtonian law of attraction F = G (M'M"/R<sup>2</sup>)
      can be applied only between two masses having the same
      temperature. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This type of magnetic field is the only type of energy
      proven to be beneficial to animals and humans. Since humans have
      lived in this constant magnetic or gravitational field for
      millions of years, the body has become very sensitive to any
      variation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Thompson Effect</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One end of a copper rod is heated and the other is
      cooled. If the hot side is heated high enough, it will thermally
      increase the kinetic energy of the outer orbit electrons to a
      point where their kinetic energy (1/2 mv<sup>2</sup>) will be
      greater than the work function and allow them to discharge into
      space. Due to the copper conductivity the electrons, instead of
      dissipating into the air, will shift in tremendous quantity toward
      the cools side in straight lines, following the heat propagation
      velocity. By reaction, excited electrons for the cool side will
      travel in the opposite direction at the speed of a particle (1/2
      mv<sup>2</sup>) toward the hot side encircling the copper rod by
      gyroscopic phenomenon and following Fleming's rule. The product is
      very low voltage (few millivolts) as a resultant of the electrons
      traveling in a circular motion. But, as in any electrical circuit,
      the EMF in the copper rod is governed by Ohm's law ( E/R = I) and
      will be in the range of several thousand amperes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Peltier Effect</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In a metal alloy bar (such as constantan, 60% Cu, 40%
      Ni) one end is heated and the other is maintained cold. When the
      hot end is heated enough, electrons of nickel and copper atoms
      become excited. The electrons of nickel force the electrons of
      copper to reverse orbital spinning (as described in part 1). By
      centripetal force electrons form the cool side shift toward the
      hot side. The hot side becomes negative in respect to the cold
      positive side, exactly opposite to the Thompson effect. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Of course, the Thompson and the Peltier effects are
      temporary; they last only until the proportion between the cool
      and the hot side reaches the electrons' numerical balance. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Let's now combine the Thompson and Peltier effects
      together in the thermocouple fashion. In the Thompson effect the
      electrons move from the hot side toward the cold side. In the
      Peltier effect the electrons travel from the cold toward the hot
      side, and back to the hot side of the copper to complete the
      circuit. The temporary phenomenon of the Thompson-Peltier effect
      now combined becomes permanent for as long as the temperatures of
      the hot and cold junction are maintained unbalanced. In physics
      this is known as the Seebeck Effect. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Let's now reduce the Peltier Effect rod to the minimum
      possible length according to the equation: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Con R = Cu R x pi. The electrons, in the reaction
      phenomenon described in the Thompson Effect, instead of traveling
      toward the copper hot junction, will be attracted by the
      centripetal force of the electrons spinning in the Peltier Effect,
      and the free electrons in the Peltier Effect will be attracted by
      the hot junction of the Thompson Effect. Furthermore, to obtain a
      sawtooth effect of a unijunction transistor, a silicon pellet is
      added between the two cold junctions, and the EMF becomes
      unidirectional with oscillatory frequency of approximately 1.9
      megacycles. In this condition 95% of the EMF traveling in linear
      velocity motion equal to the heat propagation will be accelerated
      time and time again by the hot side of the ring, and the resulting
      kinetic energy in the orbital electrons will be so great that the
      various electron shells will travel on the same orbital plane. As
      a result, portions of the atom proton energy will be exposed
      toward the center of the ring. The phenomena that then occur in
      the Ring Device are unique in their nature and not replaceable by
      any artificial means. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the Ring Device the following phenomena can be
      detected: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) The voltage is maintained at a minimum of 25 to 45
      millivolts. This EMF will produce 120 gauss at the ring
      circumference, and 10 gauss at the center of the ring. This is
      approximately 5 times the earth's magnetic field. This magnetic
      field is sufficient to maintain the orientation of the human body,
      but too weak to jeopardize the orbital spinning in the H bonding
      of the DNA. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) In the electromagnetic field and permanent magnet
      the electrons travel from the south toward the north pole. If this
      type of magnetic field is applied to the human body it will have
      the same deteriorating effect as if the jumper used to start a car
      is connected to the opposite polarity of the battery. In the ring
      the EMF travels from the positive pole toward the negative in the
      same fashion dry batteries are instantly charged by inductive
      methods. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) Like in any electrical circuit, the energy across
      the ring is regulated by the Ohm law where (E = .045 volt / R= 5 x
      10<sup>-6</sup>) I = 9,000 amp, as explained before. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is quite obvious that there is enough energy to
      supply every one of the 6.3 trillion human cells the proper energy
      needed. The energy from the ring is transferred to the body by an
      inductive method similar to the one used to instantly charge a dry
      battery. During the treatment the ring is maintained at constant
      slow motion of 1-1/2 inch per second. This velocity is sufficient
      to cause energy transfer from the ring to the body by inductive
      method, but not fast enough to create any disturbance to the
      electron orbital spinning in the DNA H bonds. In the process, the
      parasite cells (cancer cells) are also charged to the energy level
      of the healthy cells, and like a faulty car battery, they release
      the energy and reverse polarity at each end of the inductive
      effect. Four to five passages of the ring near the tumor are
      sufficient to deprive the cell energy and to reverse the orbital
      spinning of the electrons in the phosphate bonds. In this
      condition, the bases of the DNA repel each other and the DNA
      dissolves. At the end of the cell life span the tumor disappears.
      Of course, for the Ring to be effective, the treatment must start
      when the disease is first detected. Radiations of any nature prior
      to the ring treatment will accelerate the orbital electron
      spinning in the DNA H bonds and will jeopardize the benefit of the
      Ring treatment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From the above clarification it is quite evident that
      the Ring Device does not remagnetize, reorient, and homogenize the
      magnetic field in the body by external magnetization, but by
      energy transfer in the inductive fashion. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Let's explain with an example. Let's consider an
      electric generator where the rotor is formed of a plurality of
      magnetic poles. If the rotor is rotated by external means, the
      coil winding of the stator absorbs and transfers EMF at the
      expense of the magnetic pole (electric generator). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If the EMF is supplied to the stator winding, the rotor
      generates power (electric motor) at the expense of external EMF,
      while the magnetic pole of the rotor will gain intensity. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The human body is like a rotor with an infinite number
      of poles, DNA frequency, field orientation, etc. By applying
      energy from the stator (Dotto Ring) the body will create power,
      while the magnetic level, DNA H bond and the field orientation
      gain intensity. The Ring then transfers energy to the body and
      does not force the body to give up energy b means of external
      magnetic field. Furthermore, as will be explained later, the
      electrons at the end of sugar phosphate rod and in the atom of
      hydrogen (H bonds) present at the ends of the bases (nucleotides)
      have the electron orbital spinning in different directions. This
      is to ensure that sugar is bonded only with phosphate, adenine
      only with thymine, and guanine only with cytosine. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When in the 6 billion bases joined together to form the
      human DNA, one or two electrons spinning in the phosphate bond are
      forced to reverse orbital direction by means of a cosmic ray,
      radiation, high energy photon, microwave beam (radar), permanent
      magnet, high intensity electromagnet, laser, etc., due to the
      property of the sugar crystal of rotating the plane of polarized
      light to the right, the DNA immediately will release the hit base
      and attract a new one to reestablish the genetic code. But now it
      is quite possible that the new base connects itself upside down:
      phosphate with phosphate, sugar with sugar, and adenine or thymine
      with cytosine or guanine. The elements attract each other because
      of opposite directional spinning of the electrons in the H bonds
      and not because of different chemical composition. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The DNA now is completed again but with a wrong sequence
      in the genetic information. By reestablishing the homogeneity of
      the magnetic orientation of the DNA by means of inductive energy,
      the wrong base is rejected again and the proper one is attracted.
      In nature plants like peach, apricot, etc., restore the proper DNA
      sequence by means of glycosides, always present in the fruit pit.
      Glycosides are solids, generally crystalline, and most have a
      bitter taste. Their solution shows the property of rotating the
      plane of polarized light to the left. Under the influence of
      naturally occurring substances (enzymes) present in trace amounts
      in neighboring cells, glycosides can be split into one or more
      sugar and non-sugar portions termed Amygdalin. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Amygdalin shows greater property of rotating the plane
      of polarized light to the left than the crystalline sugar to the
      right. Under the influence of ultraviolet light coming from the
      sun, the plane of polarization is shifted to the left, and the
      proper orbital electron spinning in the phosphate base is
      restored. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The DNA readjustment effect is proportional, of course,
      to the amount of ultraviolet light available to the plant. For
      humans, the use of inductive energy is more effective and less
      complicated. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Thompson-Peltier Effect then, such as produced in
      the Ring Device, is unique in its form and energy creation and
      cannot be replaced by any artificial means. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The ring is capable of creating a field feasible for use
      on the human body as a product of a voltage intensity similar to
      the voltage measured across a normal cell, but with a current
      intensity greater than the total amount of energy measured across
      the entire human body (3-6,000 amps). </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>The Aging Process</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To understand the human aging process, let's now examine
      the structure and the function of the DNA. Imagine a flexible
      ladder 1 meter (39" long) composed of 6 billion steps. Each step
      has the form of two capital T's facing each other. The horizontal
      line of the "T" has 70% of its length made of sugar and 30% of
      phosphate. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The vertical line is of a different composition: adenine
      or guanine, or thymine, or cytosine. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>At the vertical ends of the "T" there are atoms of
      hydrogen (The hydrogen, first element in the atomic chart, is
      composed of one proton and one electron). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Refer now to the alnickel permanent magnet explanation.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>At the end of the phosphate rod the orbital electrons
      spin clockwise. At the end of the sugar rod the orbital electrons
      spin counter-clockwise. In the hydrogen atoms, at the end of
      adenine and thymine, the electrons spin clockwise, and in the
      hydrogen atoms at the end of guanine and cytosine they spin
      counter-clockwise. This type of "T" is called base or nucleotide.
      The DNA is then formed by 12 billion nucleotides facing each other
      and connected in a straight line to form the double helix. This is
      the genetic code and every one of the 6.3 trillion cells of the
      human body has at least one. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To form a new cell the DNA must repeat itself. This is
      accomplished by splitting the ladder along the middle of the step
      and reforming two DNAs absolutely identical and in the same
      sequence. To form two DNAs, another 12 billion nucleotides are
      necessary. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Inside the cell nucleus there are constantly at least 8
      different types of virus, 4 RNA types (negative charge) and 4 DNA
      types (positive charge). Every pair of viruses (one RNA and one
      DNA type) attracts each other to form a dipole. They do so first
      to protect themselves against any external magnetic disturbance,
      and second to accumulate energy in the following manner: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Inactive viruses are crystalline forms, but in active
      status, such as inside the cell nucleus, they reveal one RNA or
      DNA core covered with protein. Of course, even inactive status
      they still maintain all the properties of a crystal, and as a
      crystal they are very sensitive to the high sound frequencies. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Under sound frequency up to 5 megacycles the two viruses
      continuously strain each other and produce energy due to the
      piezoelectric effect (the same principle is used in the energy
      conversion of the supersonic generator). In the ultrahigh sound
      frequency over 5 megacycles, an isolated inactive virus can be
      excited to alter the transition temperatures or Curie point and
      disintegrate (Ruben). The human DNA (like a Yogy antenna one meter
      long) is tuned to any radio emission between 375-385 megacycles) </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Furthermore, the DNA is under the constant influence of
      charged ions traveling through the nervous system and acting as a
      modulation frequency. The combined action of the two physical
      phenomena force the DNA to emit a high frequency sound in the
      range of 1.9-2 megacycles in order to detect, by returning echo,
      what type of protein is missing in the cell. These sound
      frequencies are not only necessary to the DNA in scanning the type
      of RNA to produce, but also to maintain active the virus in bipole
      form by means of the strain effect. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To control the energy level from the piezoelectric
      effect, the RNA type virus covers itself with phosphate and the
      DNA type virus with sugar. In forming this special type of coating
      the virus, like any living organism, produces waste. These wastes
      are accumulated in the center of the rod just formed and will be
      called adenine, guanine, thymine or cytosine according to the type
      of virus in the bipole. The process to make the coating is
      accomplished at the expense of the electrical charge accumulated
      by the piezoelectric effect. At the end of the charge, to remain
      active the group of viruses removes the coating that now is in the
      form of a capital "T" and exposes itself to the high frequency
      sound produced by the DNA and the process starts all over again. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Due to the described phenomena, the DNA has always
      enough bases available to produce RNA strains and to reproduce
      itself. Now, let's go back to the flexible ladder composed of 6
      billion steps. Suppose we twist this strange ladder so many times
      to have only a few steps for every turn of the coil so formed
      (these coils are called base pair per turn). Since every base has
      a different polarity according to the code formed by passed
      generations, the DNA can be compared to the multi-polarity rotor
      of an alternator. In the alternator, the speed is inversely
      proportional to the number of poles and the output power is
      directly proportional to the energy applied. At every electrical
      impulse flowing through the nervous system the DNA moves back and
      forth as many degrees as one base is separated from the next one.
      The more base pairs per turn the less degree the DNA has to move
      and less energy is required to make it vibrate. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Then there are three controlling factors for the DNA to
      reproduce itself and create a new cell: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) The kinetic energy of the electron in the H bonds. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) The number of the base pair per turn in the double
      helix. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) Energy and the frequency of charged ions traveling
      along the nervous system; i.e, the DNA of the embryo cell in the
      mother's womb has 46 base pairs per turn; the kinetic energy of
      the electrons in the H bond is weak; charged ions coming from the
      mother's body are strong. Result: the DNA produces one cell per
      second. After 6 weeks of pregnancy, the DNA in the cell of the
      embryo has 34 base pairs per turn, the kinetic energy of the
      electrons in the H bonds increases, the charged ions from the
      mother are unchanged; the DNA produces one cell every minute, and
      so on. By the time the fetus is in the 10th lunar month, the
      single DNA (half from the mother, half from the father) has
      already reproduced itself more than 6 trillion times. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When the baby is born, the slowing process of
      reproduction increases. At the age of two, the DNA winds again to
      have 22 base pairs per turn, 14 at the age of 21, and 10 at the
      age of 35. From the age of 35 to 55, the 10 base pairs per turn in
      the DNA do not change. At approximately the age of 55, the base
      pairs per turn are reduced to 6. By this time, the kinetic energy
      of the electron in the H bond and the energy of the charged ion
      become very weak and the DNA stops reproducing itself, and the
      aging process beings. To slow down the body aging process, three
      factors must be considered: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) Ways of stretching the DNA to increase the base
      pairs per turn back up to 10,by means of energy in motion up and
      down along the body as in the Ring Device. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) Increase the electron kinetic energy in the H bonds
      by means of proton pulling force. The proton energy available (as
      previously explained) toward the center of the ring is high enough
      to attract (in the vacuum) one electron 20 feet away) </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(3) Increase the energy of the charged ions in the
      nervous system by means of exercise and proper diet. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>At this point it is necessary to clarify one important
      factor that is the basic secret of life creation. Without
      explaining the working principle of this secret, we will never
      understand the vital importance of the homogeneity and orientation
      of the magnetic field in the human body. All the 6.3 trillion DNAs
      of the human body are absolutely identical, all are tuned to the
      same resonance frequency, a;; have exactly the same genetic code
      sequence. Yet the 6.3 trillion cells in the human body, where each
      DNA is enclosed, are all different, and each one of these cells
      fits exactly the proper place and functionality in the human
      system. How is this possible? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The human DNA, as mentioned before, is approximately 39
      inches (1 meter) long and has 6 billion steps formed by 12 billion
      base pairs. The entire length of the DNA is necessary to maintain
      and transmit from generation to generation the entire genetic
      code. Yet only a portion of the DNA (different in every cell) is
      used to create a specific cell. How is this accomplished? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Suppose we have a thread one meter long. On this thread
      we insert 46 nylon light beads 1/2 inch long. Now let's insert
      this strange chain in the center of an electrostatic tube with
      bipole orientation. After a few seconds all the nylon beads will
      be charged with the same electrostatic energy and they will repel
      each other, leaving an interspace between them. They will repel
      each other, but not with the same force. The interspace between
      the beads located near the north side of the electrostatic charge
      will be shorter; gradually toward the opposite polarity of the
      tube the interspace will be longer. Now the only part of the
      thread we see is the one not hidden by the beads. Let's now call
      the thread DNA and the 46 beads chromosomes. Since the chromosomes
      act as a shield, the only portion of the DNA that controls a
      specific cell is the one of the interspace between the
      chromosomes, which for every cell has a different length according
      to different magnetic intensity, polarity and orientation in the
      human body. Each chromosome encloses 1,250 DNA lengths (genes) and
      each gene is formed of 100,000 base pairs (microgene). Of the
      total 6 billion steps of the ladder (DNA), only 250 million are
      really controlling the cell life. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The chromosomes appear immediately after the DNA is
      formed and they disappear when the cell is completed and just
      before the DNA is ready to repeat itself, to reappear again only
      in the new DNA. If the chromosomes of the new DNA, due to the
      phenomenon previously explained, have the wrong interspace
      sequence, it is quite possible that the DNA will produce, i.e., in
      the neck a cell that belongs in the kidney or vice versa. This
      also can be called a cancer. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Furthermore, like in a musical instrument, the sound
      produced by the DNA in the scanning system has different harmonics
      according to the chromosome's interspace. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The virus responsible for the creation of nucleotides in
      a different group of cells of different harmonics, adjusts the
      equilibrium potentials of the component charges in the crystal
      lattice. This pressure effect in the electrical field distribution
      governs the final crystal structure of the many compounds of the
      virus. If a group of RNA type of virus with a final crystal
      structure as a result of harmonics of one group of cells is
      transferred by means of electromagnetic reaction in a different
      group of cells, under the influence of the new harmonics, it will
      alter the transition temperature (Curie point). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In this transaction it will lose the protein coating and
      release the core DNA to control the protein creation in the new
      cell (Ruben). As a result, a new type of cell will be created
      different from any surrounding cell, and this also will be a
      cancer cell. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From the above described phenomenon, well known in
      physics, the Temin theory that the RNA type virus uses its own RNA
      core as a template to modify the structure of the genetic code and
      create the reversal of the DNA is absurd. If the phenomenon
      exists, it could not be a creation of the present civilization,
      but has existed from the beginning of time. And there are no
      records available of claims of apes deriving from humans. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Theories #1 and #4 of the introductory explanation
      support the principle that some forms of cancer and leukemia are
      caused by isolated viruses. In this case a physical principle
      known as the Pyro-Piezoelectric Effect will be with solution of
      the problem. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If a Rochelle slat crystal is rapidly cooled from 25° to
      0° C., the polarization increases so fast that the normal
      conductivity cannot bring about equilibrium and a transient
      potential as great as a thousand volts can be produced between two
      electrodes contacting the crystal (Ruben). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Since in the isolated virus crystal, the RNA or DNA type
      core acts as an electrode between the two poles, when the voltage
      potential overcomes the core's DC resistance, the energy
      discharges across it will be so great as to disintegrate the virus
      core a common electric fuse. The same phenomena, of course, is
      applied to the joint virus (one DNA and one RNA type) existing in
      the cell nucleus and responsible for the DNA creation. Because of
      the electrical principle that in an inductance, two joint EMFs
      opposite and contrary eliminate each other, no voltage will appear
      across the joint virus. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In an experiment with dying AKR mice (mice carrying
      leukemia), a constant laboratory temperature of 35° was
      maintained. The cage containing the mice was placed two times a
      day for 20 minutes each time in a small refrigerator where
      temperature was kept at 0° C. After 5 days of treatment the mice
      were sacrificed and pathological studies revealed no evidence of
      lymphosarcoma. A piezobaric chamber, where a temperature body
      change of 25° C can be obtained in less than 1 minute, is under
      construction to repeat the experiment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Conclusion</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>By evenly re-establishing the orientation of the body's
      magnetic field, the virus groups responsible for the manufacture
      of the nuclei (necessary for the reproduction of the DNA ) are
      bound to stay only in the specific group of cells tuned to their
      own resonance frequency with no chance of spreading to other parts
      of the body. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>With the correction of the environmental resonance
      frequency of a group of cells, a virus out of position will become
      inactive in the same fashion as a portion of a variable capacitor
      not facing the stator. In Theory #3 (Dotto), the Ring
      re-establishes the proper number of base pairs per turn on the DNA
      double helix due to the phenomenon known as the Wunder Effect. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In a vacuum, a suspended secondary coil inserted in a
      primary coil of fixed number of turns, adjusts itself to the same
      primary number of turns when voltage is applied, with capability
      proportional to the current intensity and inversely proportional
      to the square of the spring reaction strength of the secondary
      coil. This principle is widely applied in automatic tuning devices
      for modern color television. By applying to the human body
      voltage, EMF and magnetic intensity similar to the value existing
      in the DNA of normal cells (in the human between the ages of 35
      and 55) a voltage of 45 to 75 millivolts maintains a linearity of
      10 base pairs per turn in the double helix (Crick-Watson). The DNA
      of the cancer cell adjusts itself to the proper level of
      functionality, regardless of cell condition, since absorbed energy
      will be inversely proportional to the existing cell energy level.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the case of 6 base pairs per turn in the double helix
      (humans over 55), when the DNA stops the reproduction capability,
      the base pairs per turn are triggered back to 10 and remain so as
      long as the magnetic intensity is reapplied at least once every 14
      days. This results in slowing down the aging process. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Another important factor must be clarified: In widely
      known mice experiments (Presman, Barnothy), a combined action of a
      constant permanent magnetic field and microwaves in the gigacycle
      range proved to be very effective in causing tumor regression in
      mice. This phenomenon is caused by the disturbance action of the
      microwaves on the normal orbital spinning of electrons in the DNA
      H bonds. But we must not forget that to the humans we must give
      the right to live, not merely to survive. However, frequency in
      the range of 1 to 3 mc and modulation frequency of 80 to 200 kc is
      known to penetrate deeper into the human body and is capable of
      breaking the thin skin of the cancer cell without jeopardizing the
      DNA code of normal cells (Presman). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For this reason, the Ring is pretuned on the Peltier
      junction to the average frequency of 1.8 mc and modulation
      frequency of 100 kc to obtain a current fluctuation chopping
      effect similar to a unijunction transistor. The Ring also is a 350
      ohms television antenna, where the lower band resonance is tuned
      to a VHF (Thompson Effect junction) and the upper band (Peltier
      junction) is tuned to UHF resonance. The upper frequency then
      maintains the activity of the normal cell on the correct level,
      while the penetrating low frequency neutralizes the activity of
      the cancer cell. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Theory #2, which postulates that cancer cells, to some
      extent, may be considered as parasitic cells, is proven correct as
      far as the Ring is concerned. The Ring is an inductive coil. In
      the motion along the body, the Ring recharges the cells to the
      proper desired level. While the normal cells retain the charge,
      the cancer cells behave like a faulty battery. At the passage of
      the Ring, the temporary magnetic charge collapses in the same
      fashion as transformer laminations. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This collapsing effect is detectable by electrodes of an
      EEG sensitive to electrical brain impulses. By synchronizing a
      recorder to the Ring velocity, the location of the collapsing
      tumor can be detected within 5 cm accuracy. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Many years of investigation have proved the Ring to have
      no detrimental or side effects. On the contrary, it has proved to
      be very helpful for people who have suffered form exposure to
      radiation, cobalt, linear accelerators, etc. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>For all the reasons stated above, the Ring should be
      considered primarily as a tool for physicians in disease
      prevention and disease control, rather than a cure. </blockquote>

    <blockquote>The last month has been an Odyssey. The good news the
      Radio Frequency version of the Dotto Ring is in. I will call it
      the Heavy Gravity machine for now. The field strenght is about 120
      Gauss with a frequency of 1.9MHz. This is the frequency that Dotto
      claims triggers DNA replication. Anyone interested in this device,
      I urge them to read up on Dotto.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Reader’s Digest is that Gravity=Life. More
      gravity=More Life or Negative Entropy or Anti-aging. Dotto studied
      an area in Northern Pakistan called the Hunza valley where the
      average lifespan was over 120 years old. Most people attribute the
      longevity of the Hunza’s to the food and the water found in that
      particular area. Dotto discounted this as the reason for the long
      lifespans. Dotto said the region contained magnetic anomalies not
      found anywhere else in the world. The Hunza valley has a unique
      juxtaposition of a mountainous glacier area next to a hot valley.
      Dotto states that it is the thermal unbalance of the region that
      creates a magnetic field stronger than the surrounding area.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The original Dotto Ring is a Thermo-couple that creates
      a hot and cold magnetic field equivalent to 5X the field strenght
      of the Hunza valley. According to the legend, Dotto reversed
      people’s age over 20 years. The premise is that the device created
      magnetic induction or energy transfer directly into the DNA. The
      DNA is a spiraling coil like a caduceus, as you age the coil
      shortens and tightens as a function of conservation of energy.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The DNA bases are proteins that hold magnetic charge
      like a battery. The proteins convert the magnetic energy into
      electrical energy to run the processes of the cells. This is known
      as pre-natal chi by the Chinese. The Chinese system believes you
      have a limited amount of pre-natal Chi and that once it is
      exhausted you die.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The RNA is on both ends of a DNA base, as the cells
      replicate pieces of the RNA are lost. The RNA strands shorten
      until they are too short to communicate to the DNA to split.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>This essentially is also death from a western scientific
      point of view. In addition as the DNA coil shortens and tightens
      electrical impedance increases. Electricity is harder to run
      through the DNA coil. The replication process slows down as
      impedance increases. As you age you notice, you do not have as
      much energy and you need to sleep more. The feeling that people
      are growing younger around you and that you are growing older is
      another function of loss of energy within your genetics. The Bible
      has stories of people living for close to 1000 years old. We live
      for approximately 120, why the difference?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>GRAVITY… and the use of Nuclear weapons. The garden of
      Eden was a heavier gravitational environment. Nuclear radiation
      has degraded our DNA through unhealthy mutations. Essentially
      genetics is a function of consciousness, higher evolved beings
      have longer DNA strands. There are functions within the junk DNA,
      that when rearranged will lead to much extended lifespans. My
      contention is that this can be achieved in this lifetime with the
      use of Bridge technologies such as the Heavy Gravity machine.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Now for the test results since I have received the
      machine on Feb 19th. For now all experiences are anecdotal and not
      the result of any medical tests. While the device is on after
      about 10 minutes, it triggers a response from the parasympathetic
      nervous system. That is relaxation, it nothing else happens it is
      a great meditation machine. The connective tissue in the body
      starts to soften and relaxation flows everywhere. Bowels movements
      are heavy, who needs colonics. The first two treatments my eyes
      were hurting while the machine was on. I am now noticing a month
      later, I am not squinting nearly as much. The most remarkable
      improvement has been my hearing, I can hear out of my right ear as
      well as my left now. There is surprisingly little wax buildup
      either even though I am a habitual cellphone user.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Over the last month I have had a tremendous amount of
      stress, tax troubles, family members dying and possible harassment
      from my new landlord due to condo conversion, yet I have held
      together and accomplished more in the last month than at any
      previous time in my life. This I attribute to the machine.
      Emotional detox, wow! The machine seems to work on different areas
      of the body almost like it is alive, quite strange. On two
      separate occasions, my liver was moving like a heartbeat and the
      rage that was coming off it was intense. I would say probably
      limit treatments to 30 minutes per day to start and not the 2
      hours or more that I do. I have lost weight from my midsection,
      this may be due to bowel movements or perhaps there is a switch in
      the type of hormones being released into my bloodstream. I don’t
      need as much sleep and definitely have more energy. For now I am
      much more emotionally reactive, moving from vulnerable states to
      angry and vengeful. These moods pass quickly and are akin to the
      Reichian therapy sessions I use to go through. Organ pulsation is
      a sign of body armoring dissolving and the person becoming whole.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I am a lot less self-conscious and more spontaneous in
      the last month, I seem to just do things without thinking. One of
      the thought forms that I have been focusing on generating on the
      last few years is unlimited abundance, the irony of the recent
      problems with my landlord may lead to a buyout of my apartment, an
      interesting way to create abundance. What I am beginning to see is
      that this device creates compression, everything seems to speed
      up.</blockquote>

    <blockquote><b>Abstract</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A method for constructing a thermionic couple comprising
      an apparatus in the form of a ring or loop of metal such as copper
      having high electrical and thermal conductivity. The ring has
      spaced ends forming a gap joined by a bridge member formed of
      material having significantly lower electrical and thermal
      conductivity than the ring. A substantial thermal unbalance is
      induced between the junctions of the ring and the ring member. The
      width of the gap and the effective length of the bridge member is
      adjusted to produce a recurrent thermoelectric balance, resulting
      in repeated changed in the energy level of the metal atoms of the
      ring. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Summary</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In a typical embodiment of the present invention, an
      electrically and thermally conductive metal strip has end portions

      different thermoelectric properties. Means are provided to
      establish a substantial temperature difference between the
      opposite end portions of the metal strip and bridge member, with
      an appropriate adjustment being made with respect to the point of
      connection of the bridge to one end portion of the strip, to
      provide a loop wherein oscillation involving high electrical

    <blockquote><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiments</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Referring now to Figure 1 and Figure 2, a ring or loop
      56 is formed with spaced apart ends 57 defining a gap
      therebetween. In an embodiment of the invention constructed and
      operated successfully, the ring was formed of a copper bar having
      a width of 9 inches and a thickness of 1/2 inch, formed into a
      loop approximately 27 inches in diameter, with a gap between the
      ears 57. The copper material used was an annealed copper having a
      purity of 99.99% copper, and an electrical resistance of [1.7
      microhm-cm] ohms-circular mil per foot at 20° C. This is the
      international standard of resistance for annealed copper and is
      equal to 100% electrical conductivity. The thermal conductivity of
      this copper is in the order of 1 calorie per second through a
      thickness of 1 cm and across an area of one square cm at a
      temperature difference of 1° C. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>On the outer sides of the ears 57 there are blocks 58 of
      insulating material which are both electrically and thermally
      insulative. Insulating tubes 59 (one shown in Figure 2) extend
      through the blocks 58 and the ears 57, providing an insulating
      passage for bolts 61 having suitable threaded fasteners 62 at one
      or both ends. This provides a means for adjusting the gap between
      the ears 57 without short-circuiting across the gap either
      thermally or electrically. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Attached to the ears 57, as by brazing or the like, is a
      bridge member 63 forming a separate "short circuit" electrical and
      thermal path between the ears, apart from the continuity of the
      bar. The bridge member is formed of one or more rods of a metal
      alloy such as Constantan, which is an alloy of essentially 60%
      copper and 40% nickel., having a significantly lower electrical
      and thermal conductivity than the copper bar and hence a
      significantly higher electrical and thermal resistance than the
      ring 56. For example, Constantan has an electrical resistivity in
      the order of 49 microhm-centimeter at 20° C and a thermal
      conductivity in the order of 0.054 calories per second through a
      thickness of 1 centimeter across one square centimeter at a
      temperature of 1° C. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A means for heating one end of the ring 56 is provided
      in the form of an electrical heater 64 connected to a suitable
      source of electrical power, and in the case of the specific device
      disclosed, having a capacity of 6000 watts and a heat exchanging
      area on the order of 200 square inches. A means for cooling the
      other end of the ring 56 is provided in the form of a
      refrigerating coil 66 connecting through suitable tubing to a
      refrigerating unit 67. In the case of the specific device
      disclosed, the refrigerating unit has a cooling capacity of 10,000
      BTU and the cooling coil 24 has a heat exchanging area on the
      order of 200 square inches. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A two-channel electroencephalograph 68 (Figure 1) has
      one of its channels connected to the ears 57, to record the
      potential difference between the junctions of the ears and the
      bridge member. While operating the heating and cooling means, and
      observing the output of the oscillograph, the apparatus is
      initially "tuned" by fastening one end of the bridge member 63 to
      one of the ears 57, having the other end of the bridge member in
      contact with the other ear, and adjusting the threaded fasteners
      of the bolts 61 until the output in the oscillograph is observed
      to fluctuate in recurrent cyclic fashion. When this condition is
      achieved, the other end of the bridge member 63 is brazed to the
      other ear 57 of the ring. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Potential differences between the ears 57 have been
      recorded in the order of 0.156 millivolts, and the electrical
      resistance of the ring is in the order of 5.27 x 10<sup>-6</sup>
      ohms. According to Ohm's Law, these conditions would indicate a
      current in the order of 30,000 amperes, at a frequency which, from
      observing the oscillograph readings, is in the order of 100
      kilocycles per second with a modulation frequency of 10
      kilocycles. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It appears that in operation of the device there is a
      change caused in the energy level of the electrons of the metal
      (copper) atoms, which is exhibited in a form of electron
      acceleration around the ring. No electron emission from the ring
      has been observed, by irradiating the ring with ultraviolet light
      during operation of the device, whereupon a pale blue-white "halo"
      appears about the ring or by enclosing the ring in a foggy chamber
      "curie" method. On the other hand, if a bar of cadmium is
      positioned in the center of the ring and the bar is heated high
      enough to thermally excite the kinetic energy of the outer orbit
      electrons to a point where their kinetic energy (1/2 MV<sup>2</sup>)
      will be greater than the work function and allow discharge into
      space, the electron will be attracted by the proton energy of the
      ring. The phenomenon is shown by the deposit of cadmium on the
      internal service of the copper ring as if cadmium-plated. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is sometimes desirable to maintain the magnetic field
      of the ring between 240 and 160 Gauss. The amount of energy is
      determined by the temperature difference and the amount of
      resistance in the ring. The high temperatures are obtained by
      conventional electrical heaters. As an example. A heater having
      three elements, each one with a 1,000 watt rating, may be used. It
      is desirable to obtain a temperature of about 600° to 800° F. For
      the cold side a conventional coil like that of a freezer cabinet
      can be used, and connected to a refrigeration compressor. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The invention claimed is: </blockquote>
