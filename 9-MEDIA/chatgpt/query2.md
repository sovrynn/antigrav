# Electrogravitics and Antigravity Flying Craft: Ancient Legends to Modern Conspiracies

## Ancient Vimanas: Mythical Flying Craft of India

Ancient Sanskrit texts of India make intriguing references to airborne vehicles called **Vimānas**, described as flying chariots or palaces used by gods and heroes. In the epic *Ramayana*, for example, the demon king Ravana commands the **Pushpaka Vimana**, a self-propelled aerial car originally built by the architect god Vishwakarma. The Pushpaka is described as a large, splendid craft that could travel wherever its pilot wished, even into the atmosphere or space. Later Indian epics like the *Mahābhārata* also mention flying chariots, often depicted with wheels and capable of swift maneuvers. One passage describes a vimana owned by the Asura Maya that had four sturdy wheels and could traverse great distances, suggesting an advanced vehicle by ancient standards. These mythic craft are woven into the cultural and religious context – symbolizing divine authority or magical technology – and they appear in Jain and Vedic literature as well, underscoring the long-standing fascination with flight in ancient India.

**Descriptions and Alleged Propulsion:** Some modern authors and researchers have attempted to interpret vimana accounts in technological terms. A controversial Sanskrit text known as the *Vaimānika Shāstra* (translated in the early 20th century) purports to be an ancient manual on aeronautics. It contains schematic-like descriptions of several vimana designs (e.g. *Shakuna Vimana*, *Rukma Vimana*) and mentions enigmatic devices and metals. Notably, it describes propulsion systems involving rotating mechanisms and fluids. According to one analysis by Kanjilal (1985), these Vimanas were powered by **“Mercury Vortex Engines,”** essentially rotating mercury plasmas generating propulsive force. This concept eerily resembles modern electric plasma propulsion, though in a mythological guise. **David Hatcher Childress**, a fringe author, points to references in the medieval treatise *Samarangana Sutradhara* that seemingly allude to mercury-based whirlpool engines. Indeed, passages from the *Vaimānika Shāstra* itself suggest the vimana engines used spinning mercury: multiple gyroscopes were placed inside a sealed liquid-mercury vortex, with the swirling mercury allegedly driving some kind of propeller or fan. These descriptions have led some to speculate that ancient Indians might have harnessed a form of electrogravitic or jet propulsion using mercury — a claim firmly in the realm of pseudoscience, but one that continues to capture imaginations.

**Cultural Context:** Within the cultural milieu of ancient India, Vimanas were largely seen as fantastical craft of the gods, comparable to *Zeus’s chariot* or *Solomon’s flying carpet* in other traditions. The Vedas describe flying “mechanical birds” and cloud-borne chariots of deities. In later folklore, vimanas were sometimes said to be stored in *Vimana Grihas* (hangars) and used in epic conflicts. For instance, one story tells of the warrior Arjuna shooting down enemy vimanas, and another speaks of an attack using a single projectile charged with “all the power of the universe,” resulting in an explosion akin to a nuclear blast – references that some modern writers liken to ancient aerial warfare. While mainstream historians view these accounts as mythological or metaphorical, a subset of ancient astronaut theorists argues that they preserve memories of a prehistoric high-tech civilization or even alien visitors. In the 20th century, reports surfaced claiming that Sanskrit documents about interstellar travel had been found in Tibet – allegedly describing anti-gravity propulsion using a mysterious force called *laghima*. One Dr. Ruth Reyna was quoted saying these texts reveal how the ancient Indians could launch crews to other planets using *anti-gravitational* propulsion based on laghima, “a centrifugal force strong enough to counter gravitational pull”. Indian yogic lore does attribute laghima as the power of levitation, but claims of it being used in spacecraft are **highly speculative**. Nonetheless, such stories have fueled conspiracy theories that ancient vimana knowledge was rediscovered – for example, a sensational (and likely apocryphal) tale that in 2012 a vimana was found hidden in an Afghan cave, prompting covert military interest.

## Alleged Nazi Electrogravitic Craft: Haunebu, Vril and the *Bell*

During World War II and in the post-war period, a rich mythology grew around supposed Nazi “flying saucers” and antigravity craft. Fringe theories claim that the Third Reich, often in collaboration with secret societies like the **Vril** and **Thule** societies, developed disc-shaped aerial vehicles far beyond conventional aviation. These craft – with names like **Haunebu I**, **Haunebu II**, **Vril-7 “Jäger”** and even an ultra-secret device called **Die Glocke** (“The Bell”) – have become staples of UFO lore and conspiracy literature. While no historical evidence confirms any such vehicles were built, the stories themselves are elaborate, describing the crafts’ designs, propulsion mechanisms, and even cosmic missions. Here we examine the key claims and origins of these legends:

**The Haunebu and Vril Disc Programs:** According to various conspiracy authors, Nazi Germany had two parallel flying disc development tracks. One was under the SS technical branch E-IV (Entwicklungsstelle 4), which allegedly oversaw the *Haunebu* series of combat-ready discs; the other was led by the Vril Society, focusing on smaller reconnaissance craft. These accounts often begin with an occult twist: the Vril Society’s female psychic mediums (notably *Maria Oršić*) supposedly received telepathic blueprints for a otherworldly craft in 1919, said to originate from an alien civilization in the star system **Aldebaran**. With help from scientists like Professor Winfried Schumann, they built a prototype called the **Jenseitsflugmaschine** (“Otherworld Flying Machine”) by 1922. This early device, essentially an experimental interdimensional craft, was reportedly powered by an unknown levitation drive. As the Nazis rose to power, these esoteric projects were folded into the Reich’s research: *RFZ (Rundflugzeug)* test craft were built starting around 1934, using what were called **Schumann-Levitators**, and by 1939 the SS had a functional disc called the **Hauneburg-Gerät** or **H-Gerät**. For security, it was code-named **Haunebu I** and tested at a secret facility. Conspiracy sources claim the Haunebu I was a medium-sized disk \~25 **meters** in diameter, crewed by 8 personnel, which achieved extraordinary speeds of up to 4,800 km/h (and later upgrades 17,000 km/h) in flight. Its flight endurance was said to be 18 hours. Notably, it allegedly used a special armor called *Victalen* (nicknamed “Frozen Smoke”) to withstand the heat of high-velocity travel.

Each successive model supposedly grew in size and capability. The **Haunebu II** (first tested 1942) is described as \~26–32 m in diameter, crewed by 9 to 20 people, and able to reach **supersonic** speeds of 6,000 km/h or more (with later versions allegedly hitting 21,000 km/h, i.e. hypersonic ranges). It had improved armor (double Victalen hull) and more refined propulsion, allowing up to 55 hours of flight. A larger **Haunebu III**, a gigantic *dreadnought* disc 71 m across, was reportedly built in 1944. This craft – if it ever existed – was extraordinary: crewed by 32 people, boasting a triple-layer Victalen hull, top speed between 7,000 and **40,000 km/h**, and endurance of 7–8 weeks(!). Only one prototype Haunebu III was supposedly completed, making 19 test flights. There were even plans for a **Haunebu IV** of 120 m diameter, but no evidence it was realized before war’s end. The Vril Society, for its part, constructed smaller “scout ship” discs like the **Vril-1 Jäger** (RFZ-7) by 1941, and later variants such as Vril-7 and Vril-8 *Odin*. These were lighter craft meant for reconnaissance and, some say, for seeking contact with Aldebaran beings. In fringe lore, Vril and Haunebu craft were even going to be used in an ambitious plan – the “**Aldebaran Project**” – to send a craft through a dimensional portal to Aldebaran. A Vril-7 vessel was prepared for this attempted jump in late 1944; a legend claims it momentarily vanished or returned looking aged and damaged, suggesting it had traveled farther than intended.

&#x20;*A schematic illustration of a Nazi “flying disk.” This depiction of a Haunebu-type UFO is based on conspiracy literature blueprints. Typical features include a domed top (command cabin), a wide circular hull with embedded propulsion coils, and gun turrets or observation ports. Such diagrams, while iconic, are entirely speculative – no physical proof of Nazi antigravity disks exists.*

**Propulsion and Lift Mechanism:** What powered these alleged wunderwaffe? Sources speak of an **electro-magnetic gravitic drive** – often called the *Thule Triebwerk* or *Vril Triebwerk* (Thrustwork) – which used a combination of rotating electromagnetic fields and possibly exotic physics. The drive reportedly incorporated inventions like **Hans Coler’s** free-energy converter, a **Van de Graaff generator**, and a so-called **Marconi vortex dynamo** – essentially a high-voltage apparatus with a **spherical mercury plasma chamber**. When energized, this system would create powerful rotating electromagnetic fields that could warp or reduce gravity, producing lift. In essence, the Nazis were said to have harnessed a Biefeld-Brown-like electrogravitic effect or an even more potent anti-gravity field. The spinning mercury vortex idea notably echoes the ancient vimana lore, creating an interesting parallel between the two mythologies. Some accounts also reference Viktor *Schauberger’s* work on vortex physics: Schauberger built a revolutionary turbine called the **Repulsine**, which created suction and lift through intense vortex motion of air or water. Historically, Schauberger did work on unconventional flying disc prototypes for the Nazis (though they were jet- or piston-powered). His Repulsine engine is believed to have inspired many post-war flying saucer tales. In the mythos, the SS E-IV unit combined all these concepts – free energy, superconductors, rotating plasmas – to break the bounds of gravity. One fringe source describes the Haunebu drives as relying on “the world’s first electro-magnetic gravitic engines,” using “Hans Coler’s converter coupled to a Van de Graaff and a mercury vortex” to create fields that **“affected gravity.”** By manipulating gravity or inertia, the discs could dart at immense speeds and make sudden 90° turns, feats impossible for conventional aircraft. However, even the legends acknowledge problems: the strong EM fields were hard to control, crews suffered instability, and mounting weapons (like a proposed **Kraftstrahlkanone** electro-cannon) tended to destabilize the craft. Supposedly, the disk fleet was never deployed in combat due to these issues and the rapid collapse of the Reich in 1945. Instead, conspiracy lore claims the Nazis evacuated their most advanced saucers – perhaps one Haunebu III and several Vril craft – to secret bases. One popular variant has them flying to **Antarctica (Neuschwabenland)** or even off-planet to the Moon or Mars. Indeed, post-war UFO sightings (foo fighters, ghost rockets, etc.) were sometimes interpreted as Nazi craft that escaped. Early 1950 newspaper reports – like one by Italian engineer Giuseppe Belluzzo – asserted that “flying discs” had been researched by Germany and Italy during the war. And in the 1950s, *science fiction* and **ufology** increasingly wove Nazi saucer scenarios, fueling Cold War era speculation that some great power (Soviet or American) had inherited this technology.

**The Vril Mythos and Occult Origins:** A colorful aspect of the Nazi UFO legend is the involvement of occult secret societies. Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier’s 1960 book *Morning of the Magicians* first linked Nazi rocket programs with mysticism, mentioning a Berlin Vril Society. Later writers like Jan van Helsing, Norbert-Jürgen Ratthofer, and Vladimir Terziiski elaborated this narrative. They claim that Vril members, including female medium Maria Oršić, communicated with extraterrestrials and obtained technical data for anti-gravity engines. It is said that by *1934*, Vril and Thule engineers had built the RFZ-4 disc and later a series of Vril-powered craft. These groups allegedly viewed their craft not just as weapons, but as vehicles to reach Aldebaran or even escape Earth. One persistent rumor is that in the final days of WWII, the Vril and SS took their saucers to Antarctic bases or into the **Hollow Earth**, awaiting a future resurgence. The notion of a Nazi *breakaway civilization* surviving via UFOs is a cornerstone of post-war conspiracy theory. No credible evidence supports this, but it has inspired many novels, films (e.g. *Iron Sky*), and hoaxes. For instance, in the 1970s, Canadian neo-Nazi Ernst Zündel aggressively promoted the idea of a secret Antarctic Nazi UFO base, even selling expensive tickets for an expedition to find the polar entrance to the Hollow Earth. (He later admitted it was a marketing ploy, though he never fully renounced the myth.)

**Die Glocke – The Nazi “Bell” and Antigravity Legend:** Perhaps the most mysterious alleged Nazi project is **Die Glocke**, German for “The Bell.” First revealed by Polish author Igor Witkowski in 2000, the Bell was said to be a top-secret SS experiment in a mine in Lower Silesia. Unlike the Haunebu discs, *Die Glocke* was not a vehicle per se, but an enigmatic device that has been variously described as a **prototype antigravity engine**, a **time machine**, or a **particle accelerator**. According to Witkowski (and later popularized by British author Nick Cook in *The Hunt for Zero Point*), the Bell was a metallic object about **3–4 meters wide and 4–5 meters tall**, shaped like a large bell. Inside, it housed two counter-rotating cylinders filled with a **purplish, glowing metallic liquid** code-named *“Xerum 525.”* When activated, the Bell emitted strong radiation and had startling effects: witnesses allegedly reported effects on plant tissue, the gelatinization of animal blood, and some researchers died from its radiation. The device would glow violet and was extremely dangerous to be around. Crucially, it was rumored to produce some sort of anti-gravitational or field effect – “a *glowing, rotating contraption*” that defied gravity or warped time. Some say during tests it levitated or obliterated objects, and there was talk of “freezing time” within its field. As the war ended, SS General **Hans Kammler**, who oversaw advanced weapons, supposedly had all scientists involved executed (to maintain secrecy) and moved the Bell to an unknown location. Cook’s account even suggests Kammler bargained the Bell technology to the Americans in exchange for immunity. A concrete henge-like structure in Poland (the “Flytrap”) is often shown in documentaries as the test rig for the Bell, though mainstream historians identify that structure as a normal industrial cooling tower base. Die Glocke’s story has attained mythic status because it ties together many threads: Nazi wonder-weapons, occult secrets, antigravity, and wartime mystery. Mainstream scholars, however, consider it **pseudoscientific fiction** – essentially an “urban legend” of WWII. There is no documentation of the Bell in genuine Nazi archives beyond Witkowski’s unverified claims of seeing a transcript. Nonetheless, the legend persists in books and media. It reflects our collective appetite for hidden knowledge and the fearsome image of Nazi scientists meddling with the fabric of reality.

**Origins and Influence of the Nazi UFO Myth:** It’s worth noting that elements of the Nazi UFO story likely sprang from a mix of real events, misidentifications, and deliberate fabrications. During the war, both Allied and Axis pilots reported “**Foo Fighters**” – strange glowing orbs trailing aircraft – which remain unexplained (though possibly electrical phenomena). In 1946, **Ghost Rockets** seen over Scandinavia were thought by some to be German-tech missiles. After the war, real German advances like the *Horten flying wing* and *V-2 rockets* showed how advanced Nazi aeronautics had been. This created an aura of believability that maybe they also built flying saucers. In *1950*, articles in Italy and Germany (e.g. **Der Spiegel** interview with Rudolf Schriever) publicized claims that German engineers had designed disk-shaped aircraft in the 1940s. Schriever even drew a sketch of a disk with rotating turbine blades. Though these specific claims were unverified, they ignited the imagination. By the 1960s, the mythos was elaborated by the likes of Ernst Zündel and later, in the 1990s, by Tim Matthews and others, combining SS occult lore with UFOlogy. Model kit companies and video games picked up the Haunebu designs, reinforcing them in pop culture. For example, in 2018 the model company Revell released a “Haunebu II” scale model, erroneously marketing it as a historical Nazi craft – which led to public outcry and a retraction, since no such craft ever historically existed. Today, historians assert there’s **no physical evidence** the Nazi antigravity discs or Bell were real; they classify these as conspiracy theories or hoaxes. However, the legacy of these ideas is significant: they have influenced UFO conspiracy culture, inspiring notions that governments have had anti-gravity technology (or even alien help) since the 1940s and kept it secret. The Nazi UFO mythos serves as a template that recurs whenever advanced aerial phenomena are discussed in conspiracy circles.

## Post-WWII Electrogravitics: Suppressed Research and Cold War Mysteries

In the 1950s – the dawn of the Jet Age and the UFO craze – a number of engineers and inventors around the world earnestly pursued **gravity control** and **electrogravitics**. The term *electrogravitics* was coined by American inventor **Thomas Townsend Brown**, who believed he had discovered a coupling between electricity and gravity. Brown’s early experiments in the 1920s showed that a high-voltage asymmetric capacitor would experience a thrust toward its positive pole. He attributed this to an electrogravity effect (later dubbed the **Biefeld–Brown effect**), claiming that the electric field was interacting with the gravitational field. Throughout the 1920s–1950s, T. Townsend Brown tirelessly promoted this idea, demonstrating small “lifter” devices and discs that would levitate or move when charged with tens of thousands of volts. He envisioned that large-scale versions of his *gravitators* could lead to weightless aerospace vehicles and revolutionary propulsion. By the early 1950s, Brown had indeed impressed some in the U.S. military: he gave classified demonstrations of a flying saucer-like apparatus to Air Force and Navy officials in 1952. While skeptics (correctly) pointed out that the motion was likely due to ionized air thrust (ion wind), not gravity modification, the allure of *anti-gravity research* took on a life of its own.

Between **1953 and 1956**, a genuine wave of interest in gravity control swept through major aerospace companies and defense departments. This period has been termed the “Golden Age of Antigravity Research.” Companies like **Glenn L. Martin (later Lockheed-Martin)**, Convair, and others set up projects to investigate lifting electrostatic disks, gravity nullification, and the like. In 1956, the UK-based journal *Gravity Research Group* released a report titled *Electrogravitics Systems*, which compiled worldwide progress in the field. It optimistically suggested that Mach-3 fighter aircraft using electrogravitics could be feasible within a few years. Another report, *The Gravitics Situation*, was also circulated, discussing various approaches (capacitors, magnetic spin, etc.). Notably, these reports indicate **all the major US aircraft companies** had ongoing gravity modification projects by the mid-50s, and that the U.S. Air Force was monitoring them. There was serious talk in aviation magazines about “*building the UFO*” – i.e. mastering the technology behind the flying saucers people were reporting. However, as quickly as the antigravity fad arose, it seemed to disappear. By 1959–1960, open publications on electrogravitics dried up. According to conspiracy theorists (and some historians of tech), this was no coincidence: they claim the research achieved some success and was then **“highly classified”** by government agencies. Indeed, there are hints that some projects went black: in 1957, the USAF publicly stated that “no such program” of antigravity exists, even as rumors persisted of ongoing secret development.

The lore of *suppression* is fueled by a few tidbits. A famous example: Aviation writer **Nick Cook** (the same who wrote about Die Glocke) investigated and found that by 1958, all the major aerospace firms suddenly clammed up about antigravity – implying they had been **“told to shut up”** and their work was absorbed into black projects. Cook even unearthed a program called *Project Winterhaven* (allegedly a proposal by Townsend Brown to the Air Force for an antigravity flying saucer fighter). Some FOIA documents, once classified, such as a 1956 USAF intelligence report on *“Gravity propulsion research”*, show that the military was at least collecting information on worldwide efforts. The most tantalizing theory is that the Biefeld-Brown effect and related high-voltage phenomena *do* scale up under certain conditions – and that by the early 1960s the US had built a functioning electrogravitic platform. Conspiracy authors often assert that the **B-2 Spirit stealth bomber**, developed in the 1980s, secretly incorporates anti-gravity technology derived from this 1950s research. They point to the B-2’s electrostatic wing charging system (used for plasma stealth) and suggest its high voltage could also reduce its gravitational mass or drag. Indeed, some allege the B-2’s unusual *“lightning”* fuel additive and electromagnetic resonance are designed to boost an electrogravitic lift component. While official sources do not confirm any such thing (the B-2 flies via conventional jet thrust and aerodynamics), the notion that **“electrogravitics is powering the B-2”** remains popular in fringe science. It exemplifies how Cold War military secrecy around advanced propulsion can spawn enduring myths.

It is true that since the 1960s, the topic of **electrogravitics** largely vanished from public science, which feeds the belief that it became an *underground*, classified research area. Only in the 1990s did a few people resurrect it: Physicist **Paul LaViolette**, for instance, wrote *Secrets of Antigravity Propulsion* and other works, claiming that not only did Townsend Brown’s effect work, but that NASA and the Pentagon continued refining it quietly. LaViolette speculates this technology could even be used for silent propulsion in the vacuum of space and might explain some UFO sightings. Another researcher, **Thomas Valone**, published *Electrogravitics I & II*, reprinting many of the 1956 reports and adding “validating” evidence. Valone and others point to experiments where capacitors in a vacuum still showed anomalous forces (though results are inconclusive). Mainstream physics maintains that Brown’s lifters produce thrust only via ion winds and that no anomalous force is seen in a good vacuum. In fact, numerous tests (including a 2003 NASA study and a 2004 Army research lab paper) demonstrated that if you eliminate the surrounding air, a Brown-style device produces *no thrust*. This strongly suggests there’s no new anti-gravity force at play, just conventional electromagnetics. Nonetheless, the dream of electrogravitics lives on in the classified corridors (maybe). In 1985, a **USAF document** referred to a *“United States gravity control propulsion initiative”*, revealing that the idea hadn’t been forgotten entirely. And in recent years, the U.S. Navy even filed patents for a bizarre **“inertial mass reduction device”** and **“gravity wave generator”** (inventor Salvatore Pais) that sound straight out of electrogravitics handbooks. Whether these patents are serious or a disinformation tactic is debated, but they once again raised the question: *has someone cracked the gravity code under secrecy?*

## Modern UFO Lore and Pseudoscientific Antigravity (1970s–Present)

As the Cold War progressed and official antigravity efforts waned publicly, the baton of “electrogravitics” was picked up by UFOlogists, fringe inventors, and conspiracy theorists. From the 1970s onward, a rich tapestry of new claims emerged: some about reverse-engineered alien technology, others about independent inventors discovering new physics, and many involving government cover-ups. We will survey a few notable threads, including alleged black-budget craft like the **TR-3B**, gravity shielding experiments, and the revival of exotic physics like torsion fields.

**Black Triangles and the TR-3B:** Since at least the 1980s, thousands of witnesses have reported large, silent “Black Triangle” UFOs – often seen hovering or cruising at low speeds, sometimes with three lights at the corners. While some of these sightings have been attributed to stealth blimps or other aircraft, conspiracy lore insists that at least one type of black triangle is a man-made anti-gravity craft. The most famous of these supposed craft is the **TR-3B “Astra.”** First brought to wide attention by Edgar Fouche in the 1990s, the TR-3B is claimed to be a secret U.S. Air Force reconnaissance platform developed under a **black project**. It is described as a triangular vehicle that uses a revolutionary **magnetic field disruptor (MFD)** for lift. Specifically, the TR-3B allegedly “uses **highly-pressurized mercury** accelerated by nuclear energy to produce a plasma that creates a field of anti-gravity around the ship”. In theory, this reduces the craft’s weight by a huge percentage (some say 89%), allowing it to perform extreme maneuvers with little G-force on the pilots. Conventional thrusters at the corners are then used for propulsion and attitude control in atmosphere. The mercury plasma is said to spin in a donut-shaped accelerator ring around the craft, generating a powerful magnetic vortex (akin to the hypothetical gravity-negating effect of a superconducting magnet). This description closely mirrors earlier Nazi and vimana mercury vortex ideas, showing how recurring this concept is. The TR-3B is also rumored to have stealth features: the plasma field is believed to **dramatically reduce radar cross-section**, effectively making the craft invisible to radar. Though “it doesn’t exist officially,” as one military.com article quipped, the TR-3B legend holds that it was first operational in the early 1990s and was seen during events like the **Phoenix Lights** incident of 1997 (where many witnessed a huge v-shaped formation of lights over Arizona). No hard evidence has surfaced – no photos beyond grainy lights, and certainly no acknowledgment by the USAF. Nonetheless, the TR-3B has become a staple in UFO literature, essentially representing the idea that *the government has its own UFOs*. It encapsulates the convergence of electrogravitics and UFO lore: an antigravity craft built by humans using advanced (possibly extraterrestrial) technology, kept secret under the highest classification. It’s worth noting that if one compares the TR-3B’s alleged mechanism to available physics, it appears far-fetched – but not entirely outlandish. High energy plasma under rotation can indeed produce magnetic fields, and some fringe theories (like *quantum vacuum engineering*) speculate that a charged, rotating plasma torus could induce gravitational effects. However, no peer-reviewed experiment has shown significant mass shielding from such a device. Thus the TR-3B remains, as the lore itself admits, **“experimental”** and unverified.

**Gravity Shielding and Podkletnov’s Experiments:** In the 1990s, a startling claim emerged from a lab in Finland that seemed to bring electrogravitics into real scientific discussion. In 1996, news broke that Russian physicist **Evgeny Podkletnov**, working at Tampere University of Technology, had observed a **gravity reduction effect** using a rotating superconductor. According to Podkletnov, when a disk of YBCO superconducting ceramic was spun at 5,000 rpm and levitated in a magnetic field (while cooled with liquid nitrogen), it produced a slight **shielding of gravity** above it. He reported that objects placed above the spinning disk lost about **0.3%–2% of their weight** while the effect was active. This was a small reduction, but well beyond experimental error if true. Podkletnov’s account even included a dramatic moment: a colleague’s pipe smoke rose in a straight column above the apparatus, as if gravity had been bent or reduced in that column. He first published a peer-reviewed paper in 1992 (with the smaller 0.3% effect), which went largely unnoticed. But when word of his larger 2% claim leaked to the press in 1996, the story made global headlines describing it as the world’s first *anti-gravity device*. The scientific community reacted with heavy skepticism, and the university distanced itself from Podkletnov. Amid the controversy, Podkletnov withdrew his new paper and eventually left Finland (reportedly after being pressured). Over the next decade, several groups (NASA, the Japanese, etc.) attempted to replicate Podkletnov’s findings, but **failed to detect any clear weight loss**. It turned out to be exceedingly difficult to spin large superconductors without them fracturing, and to measure tiny gravity changes amid vibration noise. A NASA scientist, Ron Koczor, did pursue Podkletnov’s idea under a project called **GRASP (Gravity Research for Advanced Space Propulsion)**, but officially, Boeing (which some rumored to be involved) denied any corporate funding – hinting that if work was done, it might have been under some “*black project*” umbrella. To this day, Podkletnov insists his experiment works and even claims to have developed a **“gravity impulse beam”** device that can shoot out a force pulse capable of punching holes through concrete. Some semi-private efforts (e.g., by physicist Guido Fetta, or a Chinese team) have continued exploring rotating superconductors and other gravity-modification experiments, but no reproducible breakthrough has been published in scientific literature. The Podkletnov saga, however, is important: it showed that even within the mainstream, there were cracks where the allure of gravity control seeped back in. It also demonstrated the peril – a scientist who touched the third rail of antigravity research risked credibility and career. Conspiracists often cite Podkletnov’s ostracism as evidence of suppression: “they” didn’t want his discovery public. More likely, it was simply an extraordinary claim that lacked solid proof, thus garnering extraordinary skepticism. Nonetheless, the image of a spinning superconducting disk reducing gravity by a couple percent remains one of the more concrete hints that our conventional understanding of gravity might yet have room for surprises.

**Torsion Fields and “Reactionless” Propulsion:** In the late Soviet Union and 1990s Russia, a peculiar research program unfolded that is virtually unknown in the West: the study of **torsion fields**. Torsion field theory, as developed by Anatoly Akimov and Gennady Shipov, posits a **fifth force** in nature arising from the spin of particles or objects. They claimed that spinning masses or electromagnetic fields could generate low-energy waves that propagate at superluminal speeds and have unusual interactions (including coupling to consciousness and gravitation). For example, a spinning gyroscope might produce torsion waves that could reduce gravity or transmit information through space instantly. During 1987–1991, the Soviet government actually funded a Center for Nontraditional Technologies where Akimov’s team studied torsion detectors and generators. The results were highly dubious – in fact, a panel of the Russian Academy of Sciences exposed the group as fraudulent in 1991, leading to cancellation of official support. Yet Akimov continued privately in the 1990s (and allegedly with some secret military funding until 1997). Torsion theories have since been embraced in some New Age and fringe science circles worldwide. They are used to explain everything from ESP and homeopathy to UFO propulsion. In essence, torsion fields are treated as a catch-all *aether-like* medium that can violate known physics. One bold claim is that torsion technology can induce **levitation** or “inertialess” motion – exactly what an antigravity craft would need. In the West, concepts akin to this appear in the work of engineers like **John Hutchison** (who in the 1980s claimed electromagnetic “Hutchison effects” of levitation and metal melting, never reliably reproduced) and others who speak of tapping zero-point energy or manipulating spacetime via resonance. A notable example is **Eugene Podkletnov’s** experiments, which some theorists attempted to explain via torsion or gravitomagnetism. Another is **Dr. Ning Li**, a Chinese-American physicist who in 1999 proposed a theory of AC *gravitoelectric* effects in superconductors; she briefly obtained a U.S. Army contract to test a device, but no results were made public, leaving rumors that her work went black. The **“Dean Drive”** and other inertial propulsion concepts (which seek to produce thrust without expelling mass, essentially by shaking weights in clever cycles) also populate the fringes of this field. While mainstream science considers momentum-conservation inviolable (hence reactionless drives shouldn’t work), NASA did have a small **“Breakthrough Propulsion Physics”** program around 2000 that looked at anomalous thrust claims (like the **EM-Drive** and Woodward’s Mach Effect). To date, none of these has yielded a confirmed physics-defying propulsion. Yet the persistence of these efforts shows the allure is strong. The holy grail is a technology that can reduce a vehicle’s inertia or weight, allowing feats of acceleration and energy usage that appear to cheat Newton’s laws. UFO enthusiasts maintain that many observed UFOs exhibit exactly such feats (right-angle turns at high speed, hovering without noise, etc.), implying *someone* – whether aliens or hidden human programs – has mastered exactly this.

**Reverse-Engineered Alien Technology:** No discussion of fringe antigravity would be complete without mentioning the claims of purported **whistleblowers** who say that UFO technology is known to governments and has been reverse-engineered. The most famous, **Bob Lazar**, claimed in 1989 that he worked at S-4 (near Area 51) on recovered alien craft. Lazar asserted the saucers used a propulsion system based on amplifying gravity waves via a mysterious element 115, allowing them to bend spacetime and negate gravity. While Lazar’s specific story is unverified and he lacked credentials, his narrative popularized the idea that alien antigravity drives exist and are being studied in secret. Since Lazar, others (like Philip Corso or the anonymous “Area 51 Engineer”) have made similar assertions that technologies like fiber optics, night vision, and perhaps some propulsion concepts were seeded by studying crashed UFOs (e.g., the Roswell crash). This enters the realm of UFO lore more than electrogravitics per se, but it’s adjacent. If one believes these accounts, then things like the TR-3B could be the result of integrating human science with extraterrestrial gravity-control technology. Such claims are virtually impossible to substantiate; they rely on second-hand testimony. Nonetheless, they keep the fascination alive, bridging classic UFOlogy with antigravity research. We should also mention the enduring conspiracy theory around **“free energy suppression.”** Many antigravity or exotic propulsion concepts also double as energy sources (if you can tap zero-point energy or gravitational potential, you likely have a limitless power source). Conspiracy literature asserts that organizations (oil companies, secret societies, etc.) have suppressed working free-energy or antigravity devices to preserve the status quo. Examples often cited include the mysterious disappearance of some inventors or confiscation of devices. While such claims lack concrete evidence, they contribute to the mystique: the idea that antigravity is not only possible but *in use*, just hidden from public view.

In summary, the post-WWII landscape of electrogravitics and antigravity research is a mosaic of genuine scientific curiosity, daring experimentation at the fringe of physics, wild conjectures, and conspiracy-driven storytelling. From Townsend Brown to Podkletnov to the TR-3B, each decade produced its hopeful contenders and its lore. Mainstream science, guided by General Relativity, tells us gravity is not easily manipulated – certainly not by small electrical devices. And yet, humans continue to dream and tinker, driven by what *might be possible* if only we find a loophole in physics. This interplay between the established science and the fringe pursuits creates a fertile ground for both breakthroughs and myths. As of 2025, we have not publicly cracked gravity control. But reading through the obscure and fringe references, one cannot help but wonder: if someone did, **would we even know?** Or would it become just another chapter in the ever-growing antigravity conspiracy compendium?

## Proposed Lift Mechanisms and Theoretical Explanations

Across the legends of vimanas, Nazi saucers, and modern antigravity proposals, several recurring **lift/propulsion mechanisms** are proposed. Here we list and summarize each, along with the speculative explanations of how they might work:

* **Mercury Vortex Engines:** A concept dating back to ancient Vimana texts and echoed in Nazi UFO lore, this mechanism uses rapidly rotating mercury (often in a toroidal or cylindrical chamber) to generate thrust or lift. In the Vimana description, a *“liquid mercury vortex”* spun by gyroscopes produced a strong jet or even an antigravity field. The idea is that circulating mercury plasma, possibly electrified, can create intense magnetic fields and vortices in spacetime. In Nazi accounts, the *Thule/Vril Triebwerk* was said to include a “Marconi vortex dynamo” with mercury circulating at high speed under high voltage. This would produce a sort of self-contained levitational force – essentially a field that cancels or reduces gravity’s pull. The speculative physics here often references the concept of *gravito-magnetism*: a rotating mass or plasma can, in principle, induce slight gravitational effects (as in General Relativity’s frame-dragging). Mercury, being heavy and conductive, was thought ideal for such a device. While there’s no evidence a mercury engine can negate weight to any appreciable degree, this mechanism remains popular in conspiracy circles. The rumored TR-3B craft also uses a “[high-pressure mercury plasma accelerated by nuclear energy](#fnref-35-160)” to create an anti-gravity field – essentially a modern re-implementation of the mercury vortex engine concept.

* **Electrogravitics (High-Voltage Electric Fields):** Electrogravitics refers to using strong electric charges to induce motion or lift, under the belief that electric fields can influence gravity. The classic example is the **Biefeld-Brown effect**: a high-voltage asymmetrical capacitor produces thrust toward its positive electrode. Townsend Brown interpreted this as gravity modification – a coupling between the electric field and spacetime. His devices, often called *“lifters”* or *gravitors*, would lift themselves when tens of kilovolts were applied. The speculative explanation is that the electric field somehow warps the local gravitational field or creates a local gravity well that pulls the device upward. Some advanced theories considered by Brown and others involved linking this to the idea of a unified electro-gravitational field (e.g., using intense fields to induce mass reduction as per an incomplete Unified Field Theory). A more down-to-earth hypothesis is that the effect is actually an *electrohydrodynamic thrust* – ionized air molecules are accelerated and produce an upward thrust (which mainstream tests have shown to be true in atmosphere). Proponents argue that if operated in a vacuum or scaled up, electrogravitics might still produce a net force by interacting with the space vacuum or quantum field. In the 1950s, companies imagined building disc-shaped craft with charged leading edges that would “slide” through gravity. Some patents for “force field propulsion” using capacitors exist. As of now, **ionic wind** explains all demonstrated “electrogravitic” lifts, so the challenge remains to prove an effect in vacuum. If one existed, it might involve theories like *polarizable vacuum* or *quantum gravity effects of extreme EM fields*. Nonetheless, this mechanism remains a centerpiece of antigravity research claims, often cited as powering UFOs and even the B-2 bomber’s auxiliary lift.

* **Rotational Mass Effect (Gyroscopic Antigravity and Torsion Fields):** A recurring theme is that *spinning* an object or fluid at high speed can reduce its weight or produce anomalous forces. This is sometimes called the **inertial propulsion** or **gyro-gravity effect**. Early 20th-century inventors (like Eric Laithwaite with spinning gyroscopes) reported odd sensations of reduced weight, though classical physics attributes that to precession forces, not gravity changes. In the Nazi Bell story, two counter-rotating drums of mercury plasma allegedly produced an anti-gravitational field or even a time dilation zone. In modern times, Podkletnov’s rotating superconductor can be seen in this light – a spinning system that perhaps interacts with gravity. Theoretical approaches to explain such claims often involve *torsion field theory* or *frame dragging* from General Relativity. Einstein’s theory does predict that a rotating massive body will slightly drag spacetime around with it (Lense-Thirring effect), but the effect is extremely small unless dealing with something like a spinning planet or neutron star. Fringe theories amplify this idea by suggesting materials like superconductors (with quantum coherence) or certain EM configurations can significantly magnify the coupling between rotation and gravity. **Torsion fields**, as proposed in pseudoscience, are essentially fields generated by spin that can directly affect other objects, sometimes with zero attenuation and faster-than-light propagation. If torsion fields existed as described, they could be used to induce levitation (by countering gravitational torsion) or propel a craft without propellant. So far, no credible experimental evidence supports a macroscopic torsion antigravity effect. However, many speculative propulsion schemes – from rotating superconductive disks, spinning plasma rings, to mechanical gyroscopic drives – fall under this category of “rotation-based” antigravity. Enthusiasts often reference the **“Dean Drive”** (an alleged reactionless drive using a shaking mass, which likely just produces vibration) or the work of **John Searl**. Searl’s device, the **Searl Effect Generator (SEG)**, consists of rolling magnetic rings and was claimed to spontaneously levitate when the magnetic rotor reached a certain speed, purportedly by interacting with gravitational and etheric fields. All attempts to replicate Searl’s claims have failed, but his story illustrates the enduring appeal of using rotation and magnetism to break gravity’s grip.

* **High-Frequency Fields and Resonance (Resonant Antigravity):** Some proposals suggest that subjecting matter to high-frequency electromagnetic or acoustic fields can alter its gravitational properties. For example, **acoustic levitation** is well-known in lab settings (using sound waves to trap objects), but some stretch this to say ultrasound vibrations could reduce net weight in a gravitational field (no evidence of this beyond the acoustic pressure holding objects up, which is just normal force). More exotically, inventors like **Eugene Frenkel** (as referenced by LaViolette) theorized that rapid electromagnetic pulses could disrupt gravitation by **resonating with the gravitational wave frequency**. If gravity has a wave component (gravitational waves do exist, but at astrophysical scales), then conceivably a generator could produce an opposing wave to cancel it locally – a form of “gravity shielding” via interference. No practical method to do so is known. However, the 1990s saw experiments like the **Hooper Monopole motor** and **NASA’s Shielded Electrostatic Gravity Experiment (SEGE)**, which attempted to use rapidly oscillating fields to induce asymmetric forces. Results were null or ambiguous. Some have looked at using rotating electromagnetic fields or plasma (e.g., the Pentagon’s **Project Skyvault** in the 1980s, which reportedly spun ionized plasma rings to reduce mass – details are sparse). The speculative theory here might invoke *quantum field theory*, in which vacuum fluctuations contribute to inertia and gravity; if you could modulate the vacuum energy density around an object (say by high-frequency fields or a Casimir-like effect), you might effectively change the local gravitational constant or the object’s weight. These ideas border on science fiction but have a foothold in some theoretical discussions about manipulating the “Higgs field” or using “electrogravity resonance.” No confirmation exists that such methods work, but the US Navy’s recent **“Plasma Compression Gravity Wave” patent** hints at this line of reasoning – using electromagnetic modes in a plasma torus to create gravitational waves or cancel gravity. Most physicists doubt this would be feasible with anything short of stellar-scale energies, but the fringe community keeps experimenting with lab-scale high-frequency devices in hopes of a breakthrough.

* **Zero-Point Energy and Field Propulsion:** A broader catch-all mechanism in many antigravity discussions is tapping into **zero-point energy (ZPE)** or the energy of the vacuum, to propel a craft or reduce its inertial mass. If the fabric of space is boiling with vacuum fluctuations, some theorists (like Hal Puthoff) have speculated that inertia and gravity might emerge from electromagnetic interactions with that vacuum energy. In such case, a sufficiently advanced machine could manipulate the vacuum to *“turn off”* inertia or gravity – essentially enabling **inertial dampening** or warp-like propulsion. One concept is the **Alcubierre Warp Drive** (a mainstream theoretical idea) that uses negative energy density to warp spacetime; however, generating negative energy in usable quantities is currently purely speculative. In conspiracy lore, UFOs are often said to surround themselves with a bubble of altered spacetime, allowing them to accelerate instantly and make sharp turns without inside occupants feeling G-forces. This is sometimes attributed to an *“anti-mass field”* or *“mass reduction metamaterial hull”*. In 2019, news emerged that the US Navy had patents for a **craft using an inertial mass reduction device** – essentially describing a cone-shaped craft that can create a quantum vacuum plasma torus and reduce its mass, coupled with microwave emitters. The patent reads like technobabble, and many experts doubt it represents an actually demonstrated technology. Still, it shows that the idea of using quantum fields for propulsion has permeated even patent offices. If one could directly harness ZPE, one could perhaps create a propulsive force without expelling propellant – literally pushing off against the vacuum of space itself (sometimes called a *quantum drive*). Another example is the controversial **EM Drive** (a resonant microwave cavity that allegedly produced thrust with no exhaust); some fringe proponents suggested it might be tapping ZPE or creating a slight warp in spacetime. Mainline science attributes any small thrust to measurement error or mundane interactions, as the device violates momentum conservation if truly isolated. The concept of field propulsion also includes **electromagnetic lift** – for instance, using a powerful magnetic field to interact with the Earth’s magnetic field or ionosphere to generate lift (more akin to how a maglev train works, but in 3D). Some UFO propulsion schemes in literature involve rotating superconducting rings (to exploit gravitomagnetism) along with pulsed EM fields to “grab onto” the space-time metric. To date, none of these has moved from theory or anecdote to a verified technology. But they remain an active part of the antigravity canon, combining advanced physics hypotheses with a bit of imagination.

In conclusion, while many **lift mechanisms** have been proposed – from mercury plasmas to high-voltage capacitors, from spinning superconductor disks to warp bubbles – none have been acknowledged by mainstream science as achieving true antigravity or reactionless thrust. Each mechanism’s speculative explanation often skirts the edge of known physics, invoking either unverified extensions (torsion fields, novel quantum effects) or misapplication of terms. Yet, this catalog of ideas is valuable in understanding the fringe landscape. It shows a consistent thread: the belief that somewhere in electricity, magnetism, rotation, and quantum vacuums lies the key to controlling gravity. Until experimentally proven and accepted, these mechanisms remain in the realm of **“obscure and fringe”** references – tantalizing possibilities inspiring both sincere research and fanciful conspiracy theories in equal measure.
