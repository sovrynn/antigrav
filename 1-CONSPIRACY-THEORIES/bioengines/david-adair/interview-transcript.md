0:00
Uh there are about 61 different rocket engines of propulsion systems that you
0:06
could leave this planet with. Uh two of them are just a solid liquid fuel. I happened to just pick one out of the
0:12
other 61 engines to pick from and I manufactured a magnetic fusion containment engine
0:20
which um in simple essence is able to create a magnetic field capable of
0:26
holding a thermal fusion reaction inside like a chunk of the sun contained in a
0:32
magnetic bottle. And when you tap that power, it allows you to have tremendous
0:37
uh thrust, which is what makes the rocket go forward. And uh so imagine be
0:43
able to tap onto the power of the sun for an acceleration factor. So that it's a pretty interesting engine design. So
0:50
once the engine was um and the rocket was completed, we uh obviously couldn't
0:56
launch it where I was launching smaller rockets which were out in Calfields in Ohio. So we had to go to um White Sands
1:04
in New Mexico and that was arranged by the congressman and a consultant at the
1:10
time who was a retired general named Curtis Lame and um Curtis Lay made the arrangements from Wright Paris Air Force
1:17
Base in Dayton, Ohio. We rode down to White Sands on a C141 Starlifter and
1:23
when my rocket myself got there, we started prepping it for a launch. Um, at the time that we launched, which was
1:30
June 20th, 1971, um, a plane flew in the same day we did,
1:37
and outstepped uh, these men in black suits with sunglasses and their DoD agents. And so DoD was interested in the
1:45
um, operation, and they were alerted to it by the Air Force and probably the
1:50
Congress and whoever else was funding the program. Um, among those men, uh,
1:56
there was some NASA officials there that I recognized. Um, they instructed me to
2:02
send a rocket down 656 miles northwest of there to a precise set of coordinates
2:08
that they gave me. And I asked them, why are we go landing in a dry lake bed in
2:14
uh, in Nevada? And they said, uh, just drop it there. And I, I can do that. So,
2:19
we fired the rocket and it was a really success as far as engines go. Extremely
2:26
fast. It was so fast you couldn't even see it leave. It's like um you ever try to watch a rifle bullet leave a barrel?
2:33
That's how fast this engine was. So, we landed um about ex well not about we
2:39
were exactly where they wanted it. Then we had to get on a DC9 from White Sands
2:45
and leave for um the dry lake bed which is called Groom Lake in Nevada. And I
2:52
was asking them um do you all notice that these uh wheels on your plane, the
2:57
rubber tires and landing gears, we're going to bore more up to our belly in the dirt out there. So they said, "Don't
3:03
worry about it." So we got on the plane and when we got there, uh they were right. There were twin 10,000 ft runway
3:10
there and hangers and a 42,000 acre Air Force base uh called Groom Lake and it
3:17
wasn't on any of the maps I was working with at the time. So, um my rocket was
3:22
down on the south end of the field at the end of the runways and you can see the parachutes um bellowing in the wind
3:28
and we landed and got out and um I was assuming we were going to go look at my
3:34
rocket right then. Uh, no. We got in golf carts and rode to this center hanger which was a very low flat type
3:42
hanger but extremely large inside about size of about four football fields. So,
3:48
we pull in there and stop in these little golf carts. We're just sitting there and I'm going well that hanger is
3:53
empty. I thought this is interesting, you know. And then a few minutes uh little yellow and red lights came on
4:00
flashing and um then out of the ground or out of the out of the floor come
4:05
these little rails with chains on them. They came up around all the doorways and then the entire floor dropped out from
4:11
under. It's an elevator. We went down about 20 stories and um what was
4:17
interesting about this elevator is um normally you have chains that drops
4:23
these things. Huge worm screws were uh lowering the platform down when we which
4:28
allows it to carry extreme weight. When we got down there there was um a lot of various uh aircraft and um
4:37
workshops and offices and such that was in off of the main bay. And then off the
4:42
main bay were smaller but still rather large work bays. And in the work bays um
4:49
we went down to one that had um something sitting in in in one of the big workshops. So we
4:56
went in they opened the doors. We went inside and the room was lit up like um
5:01
if you ever seen a car sitting in a paint booth. Uh you have horizontal lights running the whole length of the
5:07
room and they arc like a rainbow all the way over. The reason being uh like in a paint booth uh it cast no shadows. So if
5:14
you're spraying a car, if you see a run and your shadows hiding it, you'll put a run in the car. So So this was the same
5:22
reason. Um it's a good laboratory to do it that way. That means it's casting those shadows. So whatever you're
5:27
working on, you can see it without being interfering with the light. And um that was the first thing I noticed different
5:32
about the room. They pulled the big covers off this thing and um it was
5:39
interesting. It's an engine that about the size of a school bus and
5:44
this engine is a pretty much a much larger version of the thing I built.
5:50
It's also electric magnetic fusion containment engine, but it is sophisticated and it is powerful. Um, I
5:58
would have to compare mine to it would be like I had a Model A and this thing was a Ferrari. I mean, it's just
6:04
tremendous powerful difference. But we both were of the same engine breed and
6:10
um, this one had been damaged right in the center of the core. Uh, in the type
6:15
of configurations we build, we have dual particle accelerators that cause the fusion reaction. Right in that center of
6:21
these accelerators is an area that I call the eye of the hurricane and it's
6:27
like an infinity pattern figure 8 and right in the center it's quiet there on a matter of conversion area. So um then
6:36
this particular engine was a hole there about 4 ft in diameter um and that was
6:42
the first thing I noticed. They asked me to look at it and um and describe to
6:48
them how I thought the thing functioned and I asked them um
6:53
you know how come um I'm telling you about your engine and they said that the engine was recovered in a um project
7:01
they was working with and they wasn't sure how the everything functioned on it and um personnel that were available
7:08
that work on that was not available anymore and they said could if I could just help them out a little it. Well,
7:14
being 17 years old at the time, um they um thought I didn't pick up on too many
7:20
adult innuendos, but I was I guess I was poor and old. I knew exactly what they were doing. So, I
7:28
said, "Fine, you know, yeah, I'll be glad to help my country, you know." So, we play along and I asked them, "Can I
7:34
walk up to it?" They said, "Sure. As a matter of fact, you can climb on it if you want." So I
7:40
got up to the engine and then um something really unusual about the engine other than the design. The alloys
7:47
itself um just the sheen and color look like um
7:52
iridescent color like um when you hold a CD disc to the sun and you see the
7:57
rainbow. Imagine those kind of colors covering this entire engine and glowing
8:03
like that. It's really pretty. The color of the engine was unlike any metal or alloy I'm was ever familiar with. And um
8:12
when I walked to the engine, uh there was a shadow on the engine. Now, I just
8:18
told you that the rooms were built where you couldn't have shadows. Uh when I stuck my arm out to it, there was a
8:23
shadow in the engine, but right on the table, there was no shadow. So, it's not a light casting the shadow
8:29
on the engine. The engine is picking up radiation off my body.
8:35
So, I back away from it, the shadow dissipates. When I bulk back up, it's back on. And so, when I put my hands on
8:43
the engine to pull myself up on it, that's where it's interesting because the alloys in some places were so thin,
8:49
it was translucent, you could see through it like a um like a sheet of amber. Um, so when I laid my hands on
8:56
it, uh, this really interesting swirl pattern would come off wherever my skin
9:02
was touching and they would swirl out through the metal going out through the to the alloy. And I didn't know of any
9:09
metal that could do that. So I thought, "Wow, this thing is heat sensitive. It's picking up my body heat waves like
9:14
that." Um, so when I crawl and they were really neat looking, smooth type wave
9:21
flows coming off my hands. So, I pulled my cell phone up on the engine and started walking over it and um it was
9:28
huge. It was radically different than mine because it was just so much of a
9:33
different design and the way they ran the the fusion flows and and the way you
9:38
would run fuel in a fuel line of an engine. This thing was totally different. Uh there was no wiring. Now,
9:45
my engine was covered with miles of wiring so I could get all the firing orders right to the cyclotrons, the
9:51
particle accelerators. Did you uh immediately know that it was alien at that time? I suspected when I put my
9:58
hands on it. Um it felt so different. It felt like a
10:04
frog belly. If you ever I don't know people play with frog bellies, but I did. Um it looked wet, but it wasn't
10:10
wet. Just so slick looking, but it wasn't slick. Um and it was just amaz
10:16
but also had such a texture and as soon as you touched it it was cold in the air
10:22
conditioned well in the facility but the minute you touched the metal it became your temperature instantly.
10:29
I don't know of any alloys that can do that. So I was started going this is not
10:34
this may not be from around here. So I'm walking down the engine and I go up to where the main core cells are and the
10:41
particle accelerators. There's a hole blown out there and I step down into it just to get a better look. Now, at this
10:47
point of view, I'm down in the hole in the engine and um uh the walls are real
10:52
smooth. They're so smooth. Uh the blast these temperatures like that engine of
10:59
mine, they run at 100 million degrees centigrade. You work with plasma physics. So, when the field dropped
11:06
down, this uh this engine's metals were exposed to that kind of temperature, vaporized. But as soon as it vaporized
11:13
at that particular point, fail safe. It shut the engine off. All this probably occurred in a nancond, a billionth of a
11:18
second. So the blast only irradiated out to about 4 ft in diameter and stopped.
11:24
Um, what was interesting is the way the engine's metal was. Whenever there's
11:29
torn places, you could rub your hands over the torn areas that are jagged, but
11:34
they wouldn't cut you because they're so smooth. It's more like um flesh being
11:40
torn rather than metal. Well, when I come up stood back up on top of the
11:46
engine, um I knew looking at some of the interior
11:53
uh parts of it and the way it was constructed, um I had enough of what was
11:59
going on. So, I turned around and told them um about this firing system here. And they
12:05
were going, "Yeah, where is the firing system?" And I started to tell them that
12:10
because I I finally figured out what this thing was doing. But then I said, "Well, why am I telling you about your
12:16
own firing system if all this is yours and you got this isn't from here, is it?
12:22
Matter of fact, it ain't from around the area, the boys." And they uh started getting upset. I said, "Let's do some
12:27
assumptions. This is an engine. I'm assuming it came out of a craft, a big one by the size proportional
12:33
differences, probably 300 feet plus, you know, the length of a football field. Well, therefore, it's got occupants. Why
12:40
in God's name be done with them? Well, that was the wrong thing to say cuz they
12:45
are up on the engine coming after me and it's time to leave. Well, when I bend down to get off the engine, I put my
12:51
hands back on the engine. Something interesting. Instead of the nice smooth wavelines, they were now look like small
12:58
tornadoes coming off all my fingertips, moving through the metal.
13:05
And I pulled my hands back, put them back on. There they were, but they were starting to calm down a little bit.
13:12
And then I realized what this thing was. Uh, they grabbed hold of me, the Air Force guy did. We got back in the golf
13:18
cart and we were riding back up to the surface. And I'm sitting there thinking, I just realized what this engine is. is
13:24
a symbiotic engine. The engine is alive.
13:30
It is an engine that's capable. The reason they couldn't figure out the firing order is that the tubing that was
13:36
cascading all over its body looked like the same pattern you would
13:42
have from a brain stem of a near synaptic ordering firing order. So
13:48
what's happening is when the pilots sit down their seats, their thought waves
13:55
drive the engine. When I first touched the engine, I was curious and odded by
14:00
it. The wavelengths were smooth off my fingers. When I was getting off down from it, I was totally angry. The engine
14:07
was not picking up radiation heat waves. It was picking up mental fault energy.
14:13
That engine is capable of a symbiotic relationship with the pilots. Did you tell them that? I didn't tell them
14:20
squat. That's why they couldn't figure out the firing order. They said there was no wiring or circuitry. No, the
14:26
pilots brains are the wiring and the circuitry. The engine needs them in
14:32
order to do all of its functions. In return, the pilots know exactly what the engine feels and how the spacecraft
14:39
feels. The entire craft is probably symbiotic. Now, before you sit there and blow this off like it's just a bunch of
14:45
science fiction, let me bring you up to date here to current events.
14:50
I just left Princeton University. There's a uh Dr. John up there, Robert
14:58
John, and he runs the pair research institute.
15:04
They have a contract from McDonald Douglas. You ever heard of them? small aerospace company to build mental
15:12
shielding for firing systems on the new F-22 fighters. So people going, "What's that got to do
15:19
with Hank?" Pilot comes home at night, catches his wife in bed with another man. He's having a bad day. He's now got
15:25
to go fight a fighter that is so sensitive. When he straps on his helmet,
15:30
just like the Apache helicopter, you turn your head this way, the gun mounts follow your head. This firing system now
15:36
links to your brain. Foxfire, Clint Eastwood, where do you think the Hollywood's getting their ideas?
15:42
McDonald Douglas is under construction building a symbiotic relationship fire and control system. Where did they get
15:49
their idea? I wonder could have been back in June 1971 and God knows how long
15:54
they've had this engine. However, it's reality. We have symbiotic engines in aeronautics. We're moving into that area
16:01
right now with the F-22 and beyond uh with our future fighters. So,
16:08
which is science fiction, which is science fact. Where does it start and end? You can't tell anymore. When we got
16:15
back up to the surface on the golf carts, um there was another problem
16:20
developing. I already knew that, um if they could hold this kind of information back, there's a lot of other things
16:26
going to happen. I also knew my rocket was gone because I built it under a
16:32
federal grant. They're going to take the rocket. Well, that bothered me enough, but the other problem was something they
16:38
were talking about that while I was standing there being a a child, they're not paying attention. And that's when I
16:44
first heard the terms first strike. And I'm going, what is first strike? And then I started thinking about it. That's
16:51
June 1971. We're in the throws of Vietnam War. We're in the pitch battles.
16:56
um wasn't long after Milani had occurred, we bombed the dick, just bombed the dickens out Cambodia uh
17:02
because the Soviets were supplying weapons to the north. We want to do
17:07
surgical nuclear strikes. General West Morland did and the Soviets had used fire one of those off and we'll go to
17:13
global thermal nuclear war. The only reason we didn't attack each other was MAD MAD, mutual assured destruction. So
17:21
the only way to win MAD is first strike. Whoever gets there first wins. My rocket
17:26
engine out there went from zero to 8,654 miles an hour in 4.1 seconds.
17:33
The fastest thing ever. So if you take that type of engine containment system and put it on nuclear warheads and put
17:39
them on a Soviet on your own subs, park it off off Siberia, the Soviets would
17:44
never see but flashes of light and that's it. They wouldn't even have time to move out of their chairs. No
17:49
retaliation. So if you take out the Soviet Union, you wouldn't destroy the whole country. You would take out all
17:55
the key military sites and the major cities and they surrender. But if you do that, you'll have to hit another country
18:02
same day called China. They have nuclear weapons and they're not going to stand
18:07
there and watch us take out the other superpower. So about a billion people are going to die in a single day. So I'm
18:13
sitting there going, "All because of my engine." Unbelievable. So, I scooped up a hand of um full of
18:20
graphite grease off of the hanger door there, the wheels, and started crying.
18:26
And I said, "I want to see my rocket." So, they thought, "Just a kid, take him out, see his rocket. I want to see what at least look like." So, when went out
18:33
there with the two sergeants on the golf cart, we got out there. I walked over to it and opened the hatch, open the
18:39
particle accelerators, put the graphite grease, just smear it on the doors inside and close it. When you turn on
18:45
particle accelerators and the fuel is using detium, ask any physics what happens when detium meets graphite. It's
18:53
um pretty bad. It's a major reaction explosion. So I turned on the particle
18:59
accelerators with no fuel involved. And I told the uh two sergeants, it's got a
19:04
fuel leak. We got to run for it. So we get on the golf cart and take off. I gave us 60 seconds on a time delay. When
19:11
he engaged, it exploded. It blew a whole size of a football field out there. There was nothing left. Now they have no
19:18
rocket. Now they have nothing to work with. But they got this got this kid. So
19:24
um I was told I'm going nowhere for the rest of my life. And it was scary. They
19:29
threw me in the room and kept me there for about 10 hours. And then um a lot of
19:34
noise in the outside. The door opens up and there's this big um stogy chomping
19:41
figure in the doorway going like that and his name is Curtis Lame.
19:46
So um he came there and got me and took me all the way back home to write Patterson and he took me back home to my
19:52
parents. He told me that um they're not going to be through with you. They'll deal with you again. And he was right.
19:59
So that was the end of my summer vacation in um my junior year in high school. How I spent my summer vacation.
20:06
And um what did he say to your parents? Well, my par uh Lame just told he didn't
20:12
say anything to my parents. He said he left it up to me. He just got me home. So, it's quiet through the winter and
20:18
the spring and I'm graduating from high school. It's June 10th, 1972. And I'm
20:23
ready to um go to Ohio State. All of a sudden, I'm shaking hands in line and I
20:28
get hold of this one line and I turn around. And I got a hold of this guy's hand and it is a DoD agent from Groom
20:35
Lake right there in Centerberg, Ohio. And he slaps this paper in my hand. I read it. It says, "Greetings. I'm
20:42
drafted." And um they throw me in a car. My parents are hollering and um nothing
20:48
they can do because I'm now property of the United States government. It's called conscription, buddy. And you're
20:54
gone. So after about 3 hours, I'm back. Um well, I was on a plane. And I was
20:59
ended up at Langley, Virginia, home of the CIA and more fun activities. What
21:04
they wanted was the engine to be rebuilt again. And um we had to work out some
21:11
compromises. I ended up spending 10 years in the Navy. Um I never did build
21:16
the engine again. That was the last thing Curtis Lay told me to do. Said never build another rocket. As long as you live, you might make it out of here.
21:23
And he was right. So um instead I agreed to build jet engines. So I was a jet
21:30
engine designer and technician in the Navy and um worked on the Tomcat and ETC
21:36
Hawkeyes and other various aircrafts and um so it became an interesting career
21:42
after 10 years I had enough of that opened up a private consulting business and I've been doing space technology
21:48
transfer where we transfer technology from space program into commercial applications. I've been doing that for
21:54
the last um 17 years. So I can take you around the
22:00
earth eight times as fast as you blink your eyes. That's the capability of this type of propulsion.
22:07
How how is this type of propul How did you come about this type of propulsion?
22:12
Oh god. Well, this is not the place to bring that up. I guess dreams.
22:18
Uh it all came in dreams. All the mathematics, everything. I was working quantum physics when I was seven. I was
22:25
born with it. Yeah. So now you know how all this stuff works. When I got to a
22:31
certain point, the mathematics were too difficult to achieve mainly because there was no computers available. I mean
22:38
handheld calculators didn't come out 10 years later. you know, the only thing I've got I have no fax, no modems, no
22:45
email, no um laptops, uh floppy discs, hard drives. None of this stuff existed.
22:52
You had a pencil, a piece of paper, and a slide ruler and chalkboards all over
22:58
the buildings and your brain. And born with photographic memory, I was able to
23:04
contain great amounts of lot what we call algorithms. I met
23:09
somebody else later that could help me with that. When I was building this big rocket, I ran to the end of my
23:16
mathematical capability and um my high school science teacher come out to my
23:23
lab where I was at work all the time. He looked at these writings. He borrowed some of them, made photo copies, and
23:30
gave mine back. Took the photo copies, went to Ohio State University. Everybody in the physics department's looking at
23:35
this going, "Where did you get Stephan Hawkins work in his handwriting or, you
23:42
know, looks personal handwriting?" No, it came from this 15-year-old kid building these rockets out in these cow fields like
23:50
so they mail the stuff to Cambridge, England. And um
23:56
um see that was June 7. In July 1970,
24:03
I went to U Ohio State University with my science teacher. Um, oh, July 1969
24:11
and um this little frail guy was sitting in
24:17
one of the big academic uh classrooms and I walked in, I saw
24:22
these equations on the walls and I went, "Who's messing with my work?" You know, and the little guy stands up indeed. And
24:29
I went, he says, "Is it his work?" And I went, "Yeah, yeah." Oh, I guess it is.
24:34
Besides, it's not going to work down on that side anyhow. Pointing to that part of the room on a chalkboard. And he
24:40
goes, "How so?" I Well, walk over and you start erasing it. Wait. You know, it
24:45
works like this. So, he looks at it and then he goes, "How do you validate
24:51
that?" I go, "Rocket engine." And he's looking at the equation. and
24:56
his back is to me and he goes, "Um, how do you get all your information?" I went, "Comes in dreams every night
25:03
consecutively." So he drops his chalk and he turns around. I figure end of
25:09
conversation good. I got I'm busy. I need to go home anyhow. I start to head for a door. He goes,
25:14
"Wait a minute." He goes, "Um," he goes, "We dream on the same
25:19
wavelength. All my stuff comes to me in dreams. Therefore, we are brothers. Have a seat." And his name was Stephan
25:25
Hawkins. So, we worked out some math that allowed me to achieve the See, we're working on
25:30
parallel mass heat. There's only one thing that can swallow and control a fusion containment explosion at the
25:38
black hole. It swallows a sun. What is the sun? Billions of Hbombs going off.
25:43
So, anyway, the that was um how I got help with with on mathematics of that.
25:48
But the way the engine works, it's on the same principle of a balloon. You
25:53
blow up a balloon, release it and goes around the room, the air escapes out the nozzle, pushes the balloon forward.
25:59
Well, the same principle with this engine. When you open up the one end of the field with the plasma beam to open
26:05
up the part particle chambers, uh you're going to get all this matter flowing
26:11
out. The matter is moving light. So, Newtonian law takes over in space. For
26:17
every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction. Just like the balloon, when this engine turns itself on,
26:23
eventually the vehicle is going to catch up with the speed of the exiting matter out the tailpipe. How fast is it going?
26:32
186,000 mi a second. Speed of light. This engine's capable of speed, light speed.
26:38
And we had it in 1971. So, but you knew that it was going to be
26:44
put to uh potential catastrophic results. Not potential for
26:50
sure. They were planning to do first strike and they had planned on doing
26:56
first strike for about the last 15 years till Soviet Union collapsed. They were always trying to beat the the mad
27:02
equation. Mutual share of destruction. The only way to do it is be there first. Everybody had the same speeds.
27:10
So, whoever got faster wins. And I'm what I'm asking is why are you starting
27:16
to go public with this information? Um there's a shift a change in in
27:23
perception of the public and attitude. Uh if it hadn't been for that I I would
27:29
have went to my grave and never said a word about this cuz I wanted a normal you know mainstream life career. Um like
27:38
I'm going to tell people u yeah I was standing on top of an alien engine in the basement of a top secret base called
27:44
Area 51. Um mainly because I built an engine similar to it. It landed there and that's why they wanted me there and
27:50
I was 17 years old at the time. Never despite uh despite the fact that I won
27:56
the most outstanding field of engineering sciences from the United States Air Force in 1971 and we can see
28:02
newspaper stories and clippings of me that rocket. So um I wouldn't still
28:07
wouldn't stand a chance. So I decided no I'm not saying a word. I saw a lot of
28:13
people take tremendous criticism in the 60s and the 70s. But then there's been a shift in the last 20 years. Uh the
28:20
American public now really believes there's somebody else out there. And if somebody would land
28:27
here right now, the American public would go, "Cool. As long as they're not trying to blow us away or eat us up or
28:33
something, there's no problem." Um what they will be a problem is is that if the
28:38
federal government's caught lying, which they know they are lying. They've been lying for probably since 1971 that I
28:46
know for sure. So if they've been lying in Roswell is very likely it's true. So they've been lying 50 consecutive years
28:52
and probably much longer than that. The engine I saw did not come from the Roswell crash. The engine I saw was as
28:59
big as the Roswell craft. So this is something even bigger. That's another one. So, how many do they have? How much
29:06
they got? You know, that's where the real problem is. Who shot King? Who shot, you know,
29:13
Senator Kennedy, you know, and and and JFK, if they're lied this much to us,
29:20
that's where the danger is, is that if it comes out, it's not so much as the
29:27
public's going to panic that is alien life out there. No, it's going to be anarchy because people gonna be so
29:32
ticked off with DC for lying so many years. Uh that's where that's what that
29:37
is what the government fears. They do not fear you being violent about hostile about aliens landing and we're going to
29:44
go crazy. No, they're going to freak out because they're going to be caught about a five decade lie. And that's why they
29:51
put out the most ridiculous story. Yeah, we take these dummies and drop them from weather balloons.
29:57
Honest God, come on y'all. Just the average guy working in a plant, making a living, trying to pay his bills, raise
30:04
his family, he's going to look at that and go, "Yeah, right." You know, and and
30:09
the polls are showing that. So, that's why I said it's pretty safe now to say
30:14
something. Not only that, the people made Independence uh day the the movie
30:19
and they were talking about Area 51 and I was looking at it closely and somebody
30:24
in Area 51 talked to the people made the movie because they were it the dimensions the way the walls were shaped
30:31
there was some stuff they missed but it was correct. So I figure if they can let that out and they didn't they're still
30:37
here and then uh the attitude shifting um it's just one thing after another.
30:42
the public's attitude, perception. I can I can come out forward now and take the heat from critics, but I couldn't take
30:49
the heat from the general public because you just got to live with them. Uh critics are always going to be there.
30:55
They'll be there like gravity. You can depend on it. Uh but that's not the problem. Do you think the aliens are
31:01
making themselves more apparent? Well, when I testified to a joint session of the Senate and Congress in April for
31:08
seetti for Dr. Greer uh we've got right on to that and uh my question was um is
31:14
somebody coming to dinner and it's not Sydney Portier is it? You know I it's
31:20
possible if they have cut a deal with somebody another race or whatever they could have reigged on the deal and they
31:27
may be in route to um meet us the citizens of the planet in person. So the
31:34
government's in a real pitch panic because what are you gonna do? No, you can't come here. how you going to stop them? Um, and on top of that, they um
31:42
they're going to be caught in major lies. So, they looked real panic about this situation. You know, I've been
31:49
sitting on this thing for 27 years and I didn't bother to say anything and Dr. Greer was said he was able to get a
31:56
hearing set up and he hammered me for two months to finally the week before the um the the testimony I finally said
32:04
I'll I'll go. So the fact that he could get that established where he was at independence day shift in the general
32:11
public's attitude by the time you add all this stuff up it comes out to equal time to talk. The briefing was uh set up
32:19
by Dr. Greer with CETI which I think is center for search for extraterrestrial intelligence and he's in Asheville North
32:26
Carolina and and he's a MD an ER doctor and Dr. Rear is um a very intelligent
32:33
man. So he had set up a meeting for Congress uh to that he had set up within
32:40
the political structure and framework to run the UFO question right through the
32:45
normal channels which all three years I've been watching stuff and he the only one that got that far and I was pretty
32:50
impressed with it. So um I finally decided to jump in there. He had 12
32:55
other witnesses besides myself and um we all testified to to him at that time and
33:02
there was about 300 people there. There was a lot of staff there but there was a lot of senators and congressmans. I
33:07
recognized some of them. Uh some of them I'd known before anyhow. Um and we got
33:12
in some serious discussions at the time. The next day uh we were supposed to talk
33:18
to the press. Uh the other 12 were allowed to talk to press. I was not allowed to talk to the press. Um, I love
33:25
him. Uh, Steve Ger asked me not to talk to the press and um I think he was
33:30
absolutely right at the time because um he thought Hang on Gu. He
33:38
does. Um it's cuz I'm so sweet. It's the makeup. Um
33:44
your sentence again, right? So I think Dr. Greer was right for holding off keeping me back a little bit. Uh the
33:50
reason being is that was too much for the press uh to get into right then
33:56
because he's got more hearings, more strategy. He's got to work. So um we talked about that later and we had a
34:03
little bit of misunderstanding the first there but we got it straightened out. But um I agree with the way he's doing
34:08
it um because there's more testimony and more things I can produce later and uh
34:17
so he's aware of that. or we'll wait for it. Um, so that's um pretty much after I did the
34:25
testimony, I I flew home after that. When I uh agreed to testify in Washington DC, um Dr. Greer told me that
34:34
there would be he has about 120 witnesses that are hardware contacts.
34:39
That's that's really important because there are other contacts that people just see uh radar images and lights and
34:46
lock on and such. Well, when we got there, the 12 witnesses he had, they all saw u radar images and confirms and lock
34:55
on and they chased them on ground radar on on board radar and planes, which to me in the mainstream world, that's
35:01
pretty darn exciting right there. But, uh, I realized I was the only one that
35:06
had hardware contact and I need somebody else because if not, I am alone in a
35:12
category by myself and I really wasn't ready for that. Uh, so I was waiting at
35:18
the last minute if I had to. I may have not testified, but there was a lawyer in
35:23
front of me. His name was Steve Lufkin. And um, Steve's story was that he was
35:28
uh, 18 years old in 1960 in the basement of the Pentagon. He was an encryption
35:34
um, soldier officer in the Navy or in the Army. And their job was to uh, break
35:39
codes. and his uh senior staff guy walked in and um Gabe laid down three
35:45
pieces of metal and one of them was about a foot long had writings and hieroglyphics on it and uh they tried to
35:51
decipher it and they couldn't because it uh they didn't have a Rosetta stone or anything to work with. So while he was
35:56
saying that I was going, "Oh great." So I start writing all this stuff down and I hand Steve the paper. Steve looks at
36:03
the paper and goes and like you get a lot of your under testimony. I swear I've never met this man before. and I
36:10
thought great. So when I got up, what rattled everything was um he had about
36:15
12 different emblems and he remembered them. I hit all 12 emblems. So the way I told the senator Congress,
36:22
I went, "How could I do that?" Simple. I was standing on top of the engine that that piece of metal came from there. As
36:28
a matter of fact, there's about 98 different emblems on this engine. I was born a photographic memory and I got them all. So if you like to see them,
36:35
here they are. And um they are interesting the way they they were grouped in clusters and they were on
36:43
every single device that was a separate device. And um I realized what uh what
36:49
they were actually not some great cosmic messages or anything. They're serial
36:55
numbers for parts. That's how they figured out where their parts are. They got heck just like us. We got to know
37:00
where all these. After looking at the emblems, some of the emblems uh repeated
37:07
themselves. There was one that had a very similar mathematical symbol of pi, but it was a modified symbol of it. And
37:14
it would show up every time there was a curved radius. And I'm going there some of the emblems
37:20
would be reversed on the other side of the engine when the two parts were the same, left and right. And I'm going,
37:28
that's all it is. No big great cosmic message. It's serial numbers just like we do on jet engines in Navy. We group
37:35
out our numbers and uh but it would give you the alphabet of their language.
37:41
So um I was able to to retain that. Also
37:46
I memorized how the engine was built.
