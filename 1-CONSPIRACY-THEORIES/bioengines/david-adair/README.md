Summary

The speaker, as a teenager in 1971, claims to have developed a magnetic fusion containment rocket engine, capable of harnessing fusion energy in a way similar to containing a piece of the sun within a magnetic field. After constructing the engine, he was invited to launch it at White Sands, New Mexico, under arrangements made by a congressman and a retired general. On launch day, government and DoD officials arrived and instructed him to land the rocket at Groom Lake (Area 51), Nevada.

Upon arrival at Groom Lake, he was taken underground into a massive facility where he was shown a much larger, highly advanced engine—apparently of non-human origin—similar in concept to his own but vastly superior. He describes the engine as “alive” or “symbiotic,” responding to human thought rather than wiring, and constructed from unknown, exotic alloys. He realized the engine’s firing system operated via mental energy, forming a symbiotic link with its pilots.

The government, interested in his knowledge, tried to extract information about the alien engine, but he resisted sharing the most crucial details. Disturbed by the engine’s potential for military use (as it could enable first-strike nuclear capabilities far beyond Cold War technology), he sabotaged his own rocket to prevent its use.

He describes being detained and later conscripted into the military, spending years working as a jet engine technician. He attributes his knowledge and inventions to mathematical insights received in dreams, sometimes collaborating with notable physicists such as Stephen Hawking.

Years later, prompted by shifting public attitudes and involvement with Dr. Steven Greer’s Disclosure Project, he testified before Congress about his experiences. He claims the government has withheld information about extraterrestrial technology for decades and that much of what the public suspects about Area 51 and alien technology is accurate. He believes the real threat to government secrecy is not panic over alien existence, but public outrage over decades of lies.

He also relates a story about recognizing alien serial numbers and symbols on recovered hardware, noting that these markings functioned much like human part numbers, not cosmic messages.
