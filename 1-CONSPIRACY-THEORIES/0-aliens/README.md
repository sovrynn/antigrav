# Aliens

This includes both claims that aliens are living underground in deep underground US military bases, and also claims that the CIA is interacting with "interdimensional" extraterrestrial intelligence somehow.

This also includes claims that aliens and/or their UFOs were retrieved from UFO crash sites, or shot down by the US military.

Also claims that aliens are constantly surveiling us, and that there are many types, hybrids, they do abductions etc.

## Fake or Legit?

If the entire alien UFO/UAP thing is fake (operation blue beam), then they have put a TON of work into it:
- planting fake UFO "viewers" all over the world across decades
- creating all the fake video footage
- designing a narrative about the different types of aliens (greys, mantids, etc) 
- faking all the antigravity documents, including the ones from the Nazis
- "Leaking" UFO designs

Additionally, based on the existence of the Graviflyer and the fact that it's not causing an uproar, I have to assume that this invention constitutes nothing more than a toy to the Americans.

So I'm leaning towards the idea that this is all real.

"The report to Congress describes in detail various UAPs. “From 1991 to 2022, the most
common UAP shapes reported in this USG dataset were spheres/orbs, discs/saucers, ovals/tic-
tacs, triangles, boomerang/arrowhead, and irregular/organic.”"
