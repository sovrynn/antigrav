 known as Alien-Human Hybrids are created through  processes and 
procedures that occur during and after the abduction of, and/or  visits 
with, Humans by ETs and Advanced Intelligences. The HR  Team believes 
many, but not all, Hybrid beings are a biological combination  between 
Humans and what we believe to be Extraterrestrials and Advanced  
Intelligences; however, their creation is not limited to the combination
 of only  two species’ DNA. In other words, they most likely have more 
than two  “parents.” The term <em>Transgenic Beings</em> was officially put forward by abduction researcher Budd Hopkins in his 2003  book entitled <em>Sight Unseen</em> to  describe these types of new beings, and as you may have already read in our document entitled <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Alien-Agenda-HP.html" target="_blank">Alien Agenda</a>, the HR Team concurs with  authors Hopkins’ and Rainey’s hypothesis.<br>
                <br>
                Transgenic beings  are created from the process called 
Transgenesis. It is “…the process of introducing an exogenous gene –  
called a transgene – into a living organism so that the organism will 
exhibit a  new property and transmit that property to its offspring. 
Transgenesis can be  facilitated by liposomes, plasmid vectors, viral 
vectors, pronuclear injection,  protoplast fusion, and ballistic DNA 
injection….<em>Transgenic organisms are able to express foreign genes because the  genetic code is similar for all organisms</em>.” [1]<br>
                <br>
              It is the HR Team’s belief  that, not only are Hybrids 
transgenically created beings, so too are Abductee-Experiencers,  which 
is why certain familial lines are targeted and used by the beings. It 
has  also been hypothesized that it’s possible all Humans contain 
“alien” DNA which might  mean all or most of humanity is a transgenic 
species. This would explain why  certain Extraterrestrials find us such a
 valuable commodity to them. They may only  require specific types of 
“alien” DNA compatible to their particular species  which is why not 
everyone on our planet is abducted, contacted or visited. This  would 
explain why scientists suspect <em>“the 97% non-coding sequences in human DNA  [junk DNA] is no less than a genetic code of extraterrestrial life forms.”</em> [2]</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if only specific  familial lines are
 targeted, it is likely these lines were the latest to have  the 
transgene(s) introduced into their genetic code approximately 70 years 
ago at the beginning  of what we are calling the Modern Era of 
Abductions. The HR Team does not  believe this is the first time this 
process has occurred to what we currently  refer to as the Human Race, 
and it remains to be seen if it will be the last  time this process 
occurs.</p>
              <p>Although some might consider his  hypothesis radical, 
it is actually quite logical when you study the accounts  from the 
Abductee-Experiencers themselves. A few quite pertinent examples follow:
 </p>
              <p><a name="DNAGoldMine" id="DNAGoldMine"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>“She informed me, while  looking at a DNA chart of some type, that I was very special to them. She said,  ‘<em>Many
 people carry the genetic marker we  are looking for, but your body can 
create the actual gene. Your body produces  the equivalent of gold for 
us.</em>’” [3]</p>
              <p>It cannot be more transparent  as to what they are 
taking and using from this particular Abductee-Experiencer.  A 
disturbing twist to this case is that the scientist looked completely 
Human and  there was also what appeared to be a Human ET Hybrid in the 
same room. Was this  an ET experience or did it involve MILABs (Human 
abductors) or did it involve  “alien” Humans? Could it have involved all
 three? We may never know with certainty.</p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>“… Angie was shown a ‘clone’ infant as well as nine 
‘hybrid tots’ and  was told they would be used ‘to prepare [humans] for 
the changes.’” [4]</p>
              <p>In this case, we believe the preparation Angie was told
  is being  undertaken is not so Humans can psychologically adapt to a 
future ET presence on our planet, but because Humans are  being 
physically – genetically – altered. They are very clearly referring to a
  change <em>within</em> humanity itself.</p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>After being shown a dying  Extraterrestrial infant, the
 Abductee stated: “This being told me that everyone  there [a group of 
Abductee-Experiencers of various different races] had to have  their 
blood tested because they were looking for something very specific that 
 they needed from us.” [5] </p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>“Each time you come here you  will give [us] life…a little at a time…” [6]</p>
              <p>When one studies accounts  such as these and 
understands the history and nature of the Contact process  that has been
 occurring over the past 70 years, there can be only one  conclusion. </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Hybrid Characteristics</strong></p>
              <p align="center"><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Hybrids-New-Race-of-Children-HP.html"><img src="NHI-%20Hybrid%20Project_%20The%20Program's%20New%20Race%20of%20Children_files/Ed-Walters-Grey.jpg" alt="ET Grey Hybrid Female" width="566" height="211"></a><br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">The physical characteristics of Hybrids 
vary nearly as greatly as those  of their Human and Extraterrestrial 
parents. In a general sense, ET Hybrids normally  have no hair, very 
sparse hair, as is shown in the image above, blond hair or  black or 
very dark hair. The black or dark hair seen on some Hybrids may or may  
not be wigs as both real hair and wigs have been described by people who
 have  interacted with them. To our knowledge, Hybrids with hair 
possessing the  genetic properties of Afro-Textured hair or Types 4a and
 4b are very rare. We  have only two reports of this; one with black 
coloured hair and the other with  very white hair. In both instances, 
the hair was described as very short.  Unfortunately, the subjects also 
believed a screen image was being projected by  the beings so it is 
difficult to know whether their hair was real or not. Oddly,  Hybrids 
with extremely red-orange hair <em>are</em> reported, although not often.<br>
                <br>
                Examples  of beings with red-orange hair are the Peter 
Koury Case, the case of AJ’s  female and male white skinned Hybrids, 
accounts from Joe and Linda Montaldo of  ICAR1 regarding what they refer
 to as “the red-headed hybrid” and one other  Abductee-Experiencer from 
U.S. who wants to remain anonymous. [7]<br> 
                <br>
              Sometimes Hybrids  appear to be naked, but they most 
likely are wearing a skin-tight body suit or  what has been hypothesized
 to be a type of film over their skin that acts as a  protective 
covering. In a few cases such as David Huggins, AJ and DI, a vivid  
blue, long, dress or robe-like garment is worn by the females. Other 
times  their clothing appears very simple and smock-like in fabrics of 
pale colours.  Males almost always wear fitted body-suit attire, 
sometimes appearing more  terrestrial and suit-like, but tighter than a 
typical man’s suit. They are also  reported as wearing jumpsuit or 
flight-suit type attire in the colours tan,  brown, Army green and 
black.</p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                On the other hand,  when Hybrids are reported to be seen
 in public, they are dressed as much as  Human-like as possible, but 
there is almost always something concealing their  eyes and their heads 
and they are ofttimes suspected of wearing wigs. These reports  remain 
controversial, but from our research, they <em>do</em> occur (albeit not
 as often as one might hear about our politicians  or members of the 
Royal Family shape shifting into Reptilians!)<br>
                <br>
                Accounts of Hybrids  being seen in public were published by Budd Hopkins and Carol Rainey in <em>Sight Unseen</em>
 and mentioned in  presentations by ACERN’s Mary Rodwell and Dr. David 
Jacobs of ICAR. [8] One  less popularized account of Hybrids being seen 
in public is a resident of Germany  who we have given the acronym of 
“SZS.” Their 1991 encounter involved seeing a  Blond-Nordic or a Blond 
Hybrid male in a grocery store in Hamburg who spoke to them 
telepathically:<br>
                <br>
“I had my first experience with what I  believe to be a Blonde being. It
 was not during the night and not while I was  sleeping, but rather, 
during the daytime. I was in a grocery store looking for  some food to 
purchase for my family and I suddenly realized that a Blonde ‘man’  had 
his gaze fixed upon me. He did not just look at me. His eyes were fixed 
on  me as if he were looking ‘into’ me. It felt as if he knew my deepest
 thoughts  and knew all of my emotions and everything I had experienced 
during my entire  life.”<br>
  <br>
“First, I felt fear. A terrible fear. At that  time I did not know 
anything about alien beings or that people were having  contact with 
them or other unknown creatures. Also, at that time this Blonde  looked 
like a human being. However, certain things about his appearance were  
abnormal. He did not move like a normal human being. The best way I can 
 describe his movements is to say he moved in a robotic fashion. His 
eyes looked  and looked at me. I wanted to run away, but I could not 
move.”<br>
  <br>
“He continued to stare at me and after some  minutes my fear changed to a
 different emotion. It is not easy to explain, but  this new emotion I 
experienced was peaceful and loving. I was astonished and I  asked 
myself,<br>
  <br>
‘<em>Who is  this man?</em>’<br>
  <br>
  To my surprise, I received an answer inside  my head, in the middle of my brain,<br>
                <br>
‘<em>Someone  who knows you</em>.’” [9]<br>
              </p>
              <p align="center"><br>
                <strong>Personal Hybrids</strong><br>
                </p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                This leads us to the roles certain Hybrids carry out. 
There is a  distinct difference in the way adult Hybrids and child 
Hybrids interact with  Humans. Just as the behaviour of Human adults are
 different from Human  children, the same can be said regarding Hybrids.
 The first half of this  document will focus on adult Hybrids and we 
will end with child Hybrids who are  more Human-like than their adult 
Hybrid relatives and caretakers.<br>
                <br>
                There are Hybrids,  usually one or two, who seem to be 
“assigned” to abductees beginning in their  early childhood and 
continuing throughout most of their adult life. Dr. David Jacobs  has 
termed these particular beings “Personal Project Hybrids.” [10] We refer
 to  them in this document as personal Hybrids. For female Experiencers,
 there are  male Hybrids who carry out this role, and for male 
Experiencers there are  female Hybrids. Although he appeared to be a 
Blond-Nordic, the being “SZS” encountered  in the grocery store may have
 actually been a personal Hybrid or perhaps there  are beings of 
different species assigned to specific Abductee-Experiencers for  
various reasons. In any case, he was following her and he <em>telepathically</em>
 responded “Someone who knows you,” after she asked  him who he was. 
After she was interrupted by another shopper at the store and  looked 
back at him, he had “disappeared.”<br>
              </p>
              <p align="left"><strong><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Hybrids-New-Race-of-Children-HP.html"><img src="NHI-%20Hybrid%20Project_%20The%20Program's%20New%20Race%20of%20Children_files/HR-Hybrid-Female.jpg" alt="Grey ET  Hybrid Female Ed Walters" width="211" height="230" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right"></a></strong></p>
              <p align="left">These unusual  relationships with Hybrids 
can continue for many years, sometimes for the  entire life of the 
Abductee-Experiencer. Some people characterize their  behaviour as 
caring and fatherly or motherly or as a lover, whilst others  describe 
these relationships as a form of control and involving what (in most 
Human  cultures) would be considered rape, since sexual intercourse 
almost always  occurs during them. It is believed these relationships 
are established for  teaching, learning and control purposes which, in 
some cases, appear to include  threats and sometimes even emotional 
abuse. On the other hand, there are also Experiencers  who describe 
these relationships as loving and they feel they are beneficial  
physically, and some people feel they are psychically connected to their
 personal  Hybrids.<br>

              This is an image is  of an advanced stage personal Hybrid 
who regularly involved himself in the life  of an Experiencer as far 
back as the early 1970’s when the female was in her  teens. This 
involved protecting her from other Hybrids, participating in  certain 
medical (including gynaecological) procedures, and having sexual  
intercourse with her at least once. After the Experiencer was happily 
married,  he only returned once or twice over the  ensuing decades. [11]<br>

and black with brilliant blue irises and although her face is quite  
Grey-like in appearance, her body appeared nearly Human, as David 
depicts so well  in his paintings. [12]</p>

 the HR Team’s  knowledge, the personal Hybrids are not the same Hybrids
 as the Abductee Experiencer’s  own Human ET Hybrids, i.e. their 
offspring or children; however, this cannot be  truly known with 100% 
certainty. There are also Hybrids that were reported as  far back as 40 
years ago who appeared quite Human to completely Human. Because  of 
this, we must consider the notion that advanced stage Hybrids who 
appeared  this early on, may in fact be “alien” Humans, an idea proposed
 by Joe Montaldo  at ICAR1 and a few others. This means they are Human 
or very close to Human,  but are not indigenous to Earth, or at least 
not the Earth of <em>our</em> time or dimension. Reports of these  types
 of Humans indicate they are also telepathic and possess highly advanced
  levels of technology. The Hybrid pictured above left is believed to be
 a Middle Stage Hybrid.</p>
              <p align="center"><br>
                <br>
                <strong>Alien Sex</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                Alien sex is not as  much fun as the debunkers would 
have everyone think it is, probably because debunkers  are unable to 
differentiate between “sex” and “love making,” (which explains why they 
are such frustrated individuals). Ofttimes Abductee-Experiencers  will 
remember having sexual intercourse with very Human appearing beings with
  all of the lovely physical attributes a man or woman could desire. 
Many times  these apparent Humans are really much more “alien” in 
appearance, and in fact,  some turn out to be completely 
Extraterrestrial or even “mechanical.” What this  means is, whilst the 
Abductee-Experiencer believes they are having sexual  intercourse with 
another Human or a Human appearing Hybrid (which ofttimes <em>does</em> 
take place with advanced stage  Hybrids) many times they are actually 
experiencing a mentally imposed screen  image by the other attending 
ETs. This is accomplished through a process Dr.  Jacobs terms “mind 
scan.” Other people refer to this process as a “download” of  telepathic
 images, “screen images” and “screen memories.” [13]<br>
                <br>
                When we speak of  “mechanical” we are indicating the 
Experiencer, normally a male, is undergoing  a forced semen extraction 
by the utilization of a mechanical device. This is  not too dissimilar 
from the way Humans treat Animals, such as Bulls in a “herd”  they might
 “own” and with which they are “propagating a particular genetic  line.”
 This is seemingly the state of affairs at which some Humans may be 
finding  themselves today.<br>
                <br>
                Some Abductee-Experiencers  who have gone public, most 
notably Jim Sparks, David Huggins and Joe Montaldo, and  have stated 
this is exactly what is occurring. They need Human DNA and whilst  some 
ETs care about us and do not harm us, there is a distinct feeling that 
we  “belong” to some of them on some other level. Although this does 
occur quite  often, not all Extraterrestrials or Advanced Intelligences 
treat or use Humans  in this manner, but this would require examination 
in a “Type of ET – Case by Case”  manner. If you are an 
Abductee-Experiencer who is having contact with several  different types
 of ETs, then you most likely know, or are figuring out which  ones are 
doing what to you, or with you, and how you are involved. If you do  
not, we hope this information is proving to be helpful and in a 
non-traumatic fashion.<br>

                <strong>Lifespan of Hybrids</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                It is a well  documented fact that in the early stages 
of The Hybrid Programme, many ET Human  Hybrid infants either did not 
survive or struggled greatly to survive. They  required “contact 
comfort” which is the physical touching, loving and caressing  that many
 mammals, including Humans need in order to survive and to develop  
normally, both physically and emotionally. [14]<br>
                <br>
                Today, it appears  there has been more success with The 
Hybrid Programme and it is more than  likely approaching an apex. We 
know they still require certain Humans in order  to survive, so it is 
likely that ET and AI Contact will continue for quite some  time, or at 
least for as long as certain beings are still around who require Human  
DNA.<br>
                <br>
                In the case of  David Huggins, although he has aged 
normally as a Human, Crescent has not  appeared to age at all, which 
tells us she either ages quite well; she has been  cloned or she has a 
much longer lifespan than that of Humans, which may or may  not be 
attributable to DNA extraction and manipulation from the general pool of
  Abductee-Experiencers – most probably David Huggins himself.<br>
                <br>
                In the case of AJ,  of their two personal Hybrids, the 
blond did not appear to age whilst the one  referred to as “The Doctor” 
did appear to age, in fact, going so far as telling  AJ that he was 
dying. He had apparently lost most of his vision and behaved in  an 
emotional fashion at the prospect of losing his life. Curiously, another
  Abductee-Experiencer contacted us and said they saw him during one of 
their abductions and they did not  seem to think he was dying having 
appeared the same as he always did. The aging  and dying narrative may 
have been used as a means of separation from AJ as he,  a personal 
Hybrid and ET Hybrid physician was needed to tend to other  
Experiencers.<br>
                <br>
                Cases have been  shared with the HR Team that tell us 
healthy ET Hybrids may live for a very  long time. We do not know if 
these are ET Human Hybrids, but some of them  appear to be quite Human 
in their appearance. Some accounts of their life spans  are 
approximately 300 years. We do not know if those are years as measured 
here  on Earth or in their world, dimension, or wherever they may be. 
Another very  curious thing is these Hybrids appeared to be children or 
at least had child-like  bodies, so we know their appearances can be 
quite deceiving.                 For example, when  one 
Abductee-Experiencer reported to us that he had seen a Blond 
child-Hybrid, he  heard another male nearby say to him, <em>“Don’t  let his appearance fool you – this one is 300 years old.”</em><br>
                <br>
              One final note on  this topic is Joe Montaldo’s red-headed
 Hybrid who also has not appeared to age  over many years, during which 
several other Abductee-Experiencers have  reportedly interacted with 
him. He sometimes performs the role of “doctor” and  some have 
speculated that he is involved with MILABs (abductions of alien 
abductees by  militaristic looking Humans). Montaldo ofttimes speaks 
about this Hybrid during  radio interviews with other 
Abductee-Experiencers on his UFO Paranormal Radio  Network and UFO 
Undercover Radio programmes. </p>

                <strong>Who, What, and Why?</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                Are ETs and AIs  using the DNA they are extracting from Abductee-Experiencers <em>solely</em>
 for The Hybrid Project? The HR  Team believes the answer to this 
question is a resounding “no” and some of the  examples provided in this
 document demonstrate that.<br>
                <br>
                After decades of trying  to make sense of the overall 
Contact phenomenon, and combining all of the  information we can obtain 
from non-channelled sources as far as we can make  out, it seems that 
nearly all of the different physical types of Extraterrestrials  and AIs
 (Advanced Intelligences) coming to Earth require something from us or  
from our planet or both, with the earlier discussion about Transgenics 
playing a  critical role. The information collected from 
Abductee-Experiencers and the  people who have studied this subject, as 
well as personal accounts, thus far, has indicated they  are coming here
 for one or all of the following reasons:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                (1) Transgenic Engineering (DNA  Harvesting and Manipulation) and Consciousness-Psycho-Sociological Studies.<br>
                <br>
                (2) “Things” or  “beings” (minerals, metals, plants and animals) from our planet.<br>
                <br>
                (3) Galactic Diplomacy.<br>
                <br>

                <strong>Alien-Human Hybrid Children:  The New Race</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><br>
                Some of the information we have learned from the 
designers or creators of The Hybrid Programme is that humanity  will one
 day be introduced to their Hybrid offspring – their Hybrid Children.  
Whether we understand their true purpose or not, it does seem that we 
will  eventually meet them, unless this is another Extraterrestrial ploy
 much like  their warnings of an impending cataclysm on Earth. (Those, 
thankfully, have not  panned out during our lifetimes and hopefully they
 never will.) Connecting with  the Hybrid Children may occur during the 
Disclosure process or it could be the  result of another completely 
different event that will allow them to come here  in an overt fashion.<br>
                  <br>
                There are many who  perhaps correctly say that 
Disclosure will never happen because of the overall  mentality of 
current Humans, and that may indeed be true. If so, this meeting  
between the Hybrid children and their parents will occur elsewhere or 
when the  Humans who are unable to adapt to the Hybrid Extraterrestrial 
presence are no  longer on Earth. In any case, the Hybrid children and 
their parent  Abductee-Experiencers will be both the channel and the 
connection that links  Humans with Advanced Intelligences. Simply 
consider these few references regarding  this pivotal upcoming event:<br>
                <br>
“… Angie was shown  a ‘clone’ infant as well as nine hybrid tots and was
 told they would be used  ‘to prepare [humans] for the changes.’” [15]<br>
<br>
I was told  telepathically that we have to… “Foster the alien children, for they shall be  revealed.” [16]<br>
<br>
“Our fifth-dimensional world is going to merge and  co-exist with your 
fourth-dimensional world... The hybrid children are all part  of the 
merging process.” [17]<br>
<br>
“For a long time, I had dreams about seeing dead  people, and sometimes 
these dead people would transform into the little Greys  and this always
 shocked me. I have tried to understand what this means and  whenever I 
concentrate on this dream I get the same answer. In German it is <em>Vereinigung der Reiche</em> which translates  as ‘a connection or union between the dimensions.’” [18]<br>
<br>
We have been told there  will be <em>Changes</em> and a <em>Merging</em>, a <em>Connection</em> <em>Between</em> <em>Dimensions</em>. Their presence, when made  known in our physical Earth based reality, will be a <em>Revelation</em>. In other words: Disclosure. Exposure. Surprise. Shock.</p>

                <br>
                <strong>How the New Race  Might Appear</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><br>
              <strong><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Hybrids-New-Race-of-Children-HP.html"><img src="NHI-%20Hybrid%20Project_%20The%20Program's%20New%20Race%20of%20Children_files/HR-TOR-Hybrid-Girl-Golden-Eyes.jpg" alt="Alien Human Hybrid" width="418" height="389" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right"></a></strong></p>
              <p align="left">The girl with the  golden eyes was seen 
amongst a group of other Experiencers in the middle decade  of 2000. She
 was being fitted with what were termed “eye coverings” by an adult  
Hybrid scientist according to the Experiencer who spoke with her. 
Curiously,  the eye coverings were worn in order to make her eyes appear
 blue and more  “human-like.”<br>
                <br>
                These may be what we refer to as “The New Humans.” 
Hybrids who can feel  and express empathy for others, are intelligently 
gifted, and have much longer  life spans than Humans: Those who 
encompass the best of our species and their  species?<br>
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Empathy</strong></p>
              <p><br>
                <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Hybrids-New-Race-of-Children-HP.html"><img src="NHI-%20Hybrid%20Project_%20The%20Program's%20New%20Race%20of%20Children_files/HR-Hybrids.jpg" alt="ET, AI, Alien Human Hybrid Children" width="107" height="431" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right"></a>Empathy
 appears to be a very important trait to the beings involved in  their 
creation. In 2012, an accounting of what appeared to be a five month old
  Hybrid child who had the ability to express empathy for another child 
was  shared with the HR Team. This act and achievement meant a great 
deal to the  beings involved in this particular Hybrid’s creation. Since
 we are quite confident  that some of the Hybrids appear more child-like
 than they truly are, and  possibly have longer life spans than Humans, 
the five month old child could  have, in reality, been much older. In 
any case, the ability for their children to  express empathy for others 
appears to be of exceptional importance to them.<strong><br>
                </strong><br>
                Many of the Hybrid children appear to want to be with 
their Human  parents. Some are rightfully afraid of Humans, but many 
want to be with them  here or want their Human parents with them. We do 
not know precisely where they  are living or existing now. Some have 
been described to be living in squalid  and dark environments and others
 appear to be well cared for. They could be in  another dimension, which
 is what “SZS” and “KM” were told. Some could be living  on board their 
craft or in bases here on Earth, or perhaps even on our moon and  deep 
within our oceans in structures most humans would never have knowledge 
of  or access to. This information comes from various excellent sources,
 but all we  know for certain is, they are out there – most likely 
already <em>here</em> – somewhere. [19] &nbsp;</p>
              <p>If you are experiencing Contact, we hope this document 
has been helpful  and in a non-traumatic way. Even good or exciting 
events in our lives can cause  stress, which is called Eustress or “good
 stress.” It is the psychological and  physical response we get when we 
achieve something difficult. Living with  Contact is stressful and at 
times difficult, but at times it can also be  Eustress-ful when we wake 
up a new day and know we are stronger – or at least  are enduring and 
are making progress in our search for the truth.</p>

with red hair. According to The Montaldo’s and ICAR1, several  
Abductee-Experiencers have reported seeing the same or a similar male 
who has  red hair. Many times he is referred to as a “doctor” and his 
demeanour is quite  “intense.” He is believed to be a Hybrid being who 
is suspected to be involved  in MILAB type encounters. There is also the
 possibility he is a Human being.</p>
