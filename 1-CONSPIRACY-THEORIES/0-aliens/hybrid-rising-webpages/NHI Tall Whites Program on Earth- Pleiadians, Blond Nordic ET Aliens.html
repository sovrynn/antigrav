              The species referred to as the Tall Whites is another that
 is somewhat  elusive or at best, confusing. It is possible that in the 
many reports of Blond  Nordic beings, some of those cases may actually 
fall into the category of Tall  Whites and visa versa. There may also be
 confusion relating to beings referred  to as The Pleiadians and some of
 the accounts published in this document may  actually involve Pleiadian
 beings. </p>
              <p>Accounts and descriptions from interviews conducted and
 personal case  histories indicate the Tall Whites range in height from 6
 feet (1.8 meters) to an  incredible and rare 10 feet (3 meters) tall. 
They are known for wearing white  or light coloured body suits and 
having white hair, although their hair is ofttimes  described as thin or
 sparse. They have been reported to have both piercing blue  eyes and 
black eyes in rare cases. Tall Whites with blue eyes are reported most  
often. Their skin is described as appearing similar to peach fuzz or a 
soft downy  type skin that appears soft like feathers or fur but not 
like feathers or fur  Humans are accustomed to seeing in their known 
reality. They have delicate  features and hands with five fingers that 
come to a point with no discernable  fingernails.</p>

              <p>The earliest known published encounter with Tall Whites
 occurred in  November of 1896 on a country road near Lodi,   California
 by Colonel H.G Shaw  and his travelling partner Camille Spooner. A 
newspaper article detailing the  event was published two days later in 
the <em>Stockton  Evening Mail</em> of Stockton,   California. The 
Beings were seven  feet tall, had very little strength and their weight 
was described as being about  one “ounce.” When they communicated with 
one another their language was  described as “warbling” and sounded like
 “…a monotonous chant” that “inclined  to be guttural.” Their feet were 
long and narrow and their toes were long  enough to be used as we would 
use our fingers perhaps similar to other Earth primates.  In fact, 
Colonel Shaw describes them doing just that. Quoting Shaw:<br>
                <br>
“They were  without any sort of clothing, but were covered with a 
natural growth hard to  describe; it was not hair, neither was it like 
feathers, but it was as soft as  silk to the touch, and their skin was 
like velvet. Their faces and heads were  without hair, the ears were 
very small, and the nose had the appearance of  polished ivory, while 
the eyes were large and lustrous. The mouth, however, was  small, and it
 seemed to me that they were without teeth. That and other things  led 
me to believe that they neither ate nor drank, and that life was 
sustained  by some sort of gas. Each of them had swung under the left 
arm a bag to which  was attached a nozzle, and every little while, one 
or the other would place the  nozzle on his mouth, at which time I heard
 a sound of escaping gas. It was much  the same sound as is produced by a
 person blowing up a football.”<br>
  <br>
“… They  were possessed of a strange and indescribable beauty. I can 
express myself in  no other way. They were graceful to a degree, and 
more divinely beautiful than  anything I ever beheld.” <br>
  <br>
“…Each  held to his hand something about the size of a hen’s egg. Upon 
holding them up  and partly opening the hand, these substances emitted 
the most remarkable,  intense and penetrating light one can imagine. 
Notwithstanding its intensity it  had no unpleasant effect upon our 
eyes, and we found we could gaze directly at  it. It seemed to me to be 
some sort of luminous mineral, though they had  complete control of it.”<br>
  <br>
“Finally  they became tired of examining us and our horse and buggy, and
 then one of  them, at a signal from one who appeared to be the leader, 
attempted to lift me,  probably with the intention of carrying me away. 
Although I made not the slightest  resistance he could not move me, and 
finally the three of them tried it without  the slightest success. They 
appeared to have no muscular power outside of being  able to move their 
own limbs.” [1]<br>

  </strong><br>
  Similar  descriptions of their weight and limits of their strength are
 repeated in more  modern day abduction accounts by 
Abductee-Experiencers. Take note of the  similarities between Shaw’s 
description and the image of the being published  here.</p>
              <p>Another famous encounter involving similar beings is 
that of Antônio Vilas-Boas, a Brazilian farmer  who was abducted in 
October of 1957. The beings he encountered apparently  communicated 
through speech that sounded like barks and growls and could be 
considered  similar to the way the beings communicated in front of Shaw 
and his companion,  i.e., warbling and guttural. Vilas-Boas described 
the female he interacted with  as follows:</p>
              <p>“Her hair  was blonde, nearly white…it was smooth, not 
very thick, with a part in the center and she had big blue eyes, rather 
longer than round,  for they slanted outward, like those pencil-drawn 
girls made to look like  Arabian princesses, that look as if they were 
slit ... except that they were  natural; there was no makeup.”<br>
                <br>
“Her nose  was straight, not pointed, not turned-up, nor too big. The 
contour of her face  was different, though, because she had very high, 
prominent cheekbones that  made her face narrowed to a peak, so that all
 of a sudden it ended in a pointed  chin, which gave the lower part of 
her face a very pointed look. Her lips were  very thin, nearly invisible
 in fact.” [2]<br>
  <br>
  Another similar  description comes from an Experiencer who describes a Tall White male:<br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Articles/Hybrids-Rising-Tall-White-ETs-On-Earth.html" target="_blank"><img src="NHI%20Tall%20Whites%20Program%20on%20Earth-%20Pleiadians,%20Blond%20Nordic%20ET%20Aliens_files/Tall-White-Group-2015.jpg" alt="Tall White Alien Image" width="250" height="347" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left"></a>“The
 being I saw had the piercing blue eyes. He had paper white skin and 
thin,  delicate features. His fingers were thin, white and delicate. 
There were two  people in front me and each one of us was to approach 
this being, who appeared to be sitting on the ground, and we were to  
perform some sort of ritual involving an opalescent white disc which was
 on the  ground next to him. The disc was approximately 2 ½ to 3 inches 
in diameter."<br>
  <br>
“I watched  two of the people before me walk up to the being and then 
kneel down. They  touched the small white disc on the ground and then 
touched their face – either  their lips or their forehead. I wasn’t 
sure. To me they appeared to be showing  reverence to this being because
 he was so superior to them – to us humans. When  it was my turn, I 
approached the being and knelt down and put out my right  hand. I gently
 shook his left hand. While I did this, we looked at one another  and 
then I looked at his hand. It was very delicate and white and soft. I 
don’t  remember fingernails, but if he had them, they were the same 
color as his skin. His fingers were somewhat pointed, and  again, I made
 a mental note of how delicate they were.”</p>
              <p>“I looked into his eyes and noted they were smaller 
than ours and a  beautiful piercing baby-blue color. This all happened  
while I held his hand and looked into his eyes. He told me I was not 
performing  the greeting correctly. He seemed to be gently scolding 
me... I did it all  wrong. I didn’t follow the ritual greeting properly 
because I didn’t feel he  should be worshipped like a superior being. He
 was just a being and even though  he might be more intelligent and 
possess superior technology and be telepathic,  I wasn’t going to bow 
down to him. He told me, in a way, that I was wrong, but  at the same 
time, he found my behavior amusing. He  was sensing my human ego I 
think.” [3]</p>
              <p>Another very interesting account is from an Experiencer
 who recalled  having travelled and having been gone (as a result of the
 encounter) for an  entire week. The subject felt the time they 
travelled to consisted  of a duration of one week, but the time here on 
Earth was much briefer, seeming  to last just a few hours. From the 
Experiencer’s interview:</p>
              <p>“I saw two females who stood close to me. They had  
longish, straight blond hair and their eyes were golden and the skin 
around  their eyes appeared reddish pink. They were intense to behold. 
They were  wearing cream coloured robe like garments, but they didn’t 
close all the way in  places so I could see their skin quite well and it
 appeared paper white. I  could even see the texture in their skin. It 
was similar to ours, but different  too. They didn’t exactly have 
scales, but their skin wasn’t perfectly smooth  either. I’d say the 
texture of their skin was similar to a lizard or smooth  snake skin, but
 very white. I also saw areas on their skin that had what we  would call
 spots [moles] but there’s were very small and not raised and looked 
like  reddish specks here and there. This was on their legs. Their skin 
was very  different from ours.”</p>
              <p>“We conversed with one another regarding our skin 
colour,  texture and tone. They told me the name of the marks on their 
skin, the spot  like marks, and they called them ‘age spots’ as we would
 describe our skin when  we become aged…their skin didn’t look anything 
like ours though.” [4]<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>What follows is another brief description concerning the  height of the Tall Whites:</p>
              <p>“…I saw a very tall blonde man. There was someone else 
with us and my  wife was nearby. I looked up at the man and asked him 
how tall he was and he  said he was 8 feet tall. That was about what I 
was thinking as I looked up at  him. I turned to my wife and told her, 
‘See, I told you they were tall.’” [5]</p>

              <p align="center"><strong>Charles  Hall’s Tall Whites<br>
              <br>
              </strong></p>
              <p><img src="NHI%20Tall%20Whites%20Program%20on%20Earth-%20Pleiadians,%20Blond%20Nordic%20ET%20Aliens_files/HR-Charles-Halls-Tall-Whites.jpg" alt="Tall Whites seen by Charles Hall" width="322" height="396" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left"></p>
              <p>Another interesting case is that involving a former 
military airman  named Charles Hall. His encounters with Tall Whites 
occurred during a two year  duty assignment at Nellis Air Force Base 
from 1965 to 1967. There is now  available a series of books that can be
 purchased  entitled <em>Millennial Hospitality</em>. [6]</p>
              <p>Charles Hall waited 20 years after he left the Air 
Force before he began  writing down his experiences with the Tall 
Whites. He waited another 20 years  before he published them as fiction,
 but he reversed himself and began telling  people they were actually 
true, i.e., non-fiction. This may sound unusual, perhaps  even 
discrediting to some, but when one considers the ramifications of going 
 public with a “nonfiction account of aliens” in the current day and 
compares  the potential ramifications from certain cultures during the 
era of the 1960’s,  it makes sense he would wait so long before “coming 
out” as it were. There is  also the possibility he might have lost any 
monies coming to him from his  former military position in the manner of
 benefits. Furthermore, it is probable  he had “delayed” memories of his
 experiences with the Tall Whites similar to  the manner 
Abductee-Experiencers describe. Many have told us <em>“…the information is for a later time”</em> and <em>“...</em>they told me<em>, ‘you will know what to do with the  information when the time is right…”</em></p>
              <p>Charles Hall described the Tall Whites as appearing 
quite human looking  in some respects and standing between six and seven
 feet (1.8 to 2.1 meters)  tall. He said they had chalk white coloured 
skin and their physique appeared  frail and thin. They apparently live 
much, much longer than humans and  supposedly reach even taller heights 
later in their lives; as much as nine feet  (2.7 meters) tall.<br>
                <br>
                <img src="NHI%20Tall%20Whites%20Program%20on%20Earth-%20Pleiadians,%20Blond%20Nordic%20ET%20Aliens_files/HR-Tall-White-C-Hall.jpg" alt="HybridsRising.com: Alien-Abduction-Tall-Whites-Alien-Abduction-Charles-Hall.jpg" width="231" height="299" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right">Their
 speech is somewhat similar to what we come across in other reports  of 
suspected Tall Whites. Hall’s description of their speech is like that 
of a  high pitched “dog barking” or “a meadowlark singing.” However, he 
also said  they could mimic human speech so accurately that it would be 
impossible to know  it was not a human voice if one were speaking using a
 telephone.<br>
                <br>
                One of the  most interesting pieces of technology he 
spoke about, at least as it relates to  the Experiencer encounters, is a
 <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Articles/Hybrids-Rising-Tall-White-ETs-On-Earth.html#StunDevice" target="_blank">pencil-like tool</a> Hall said is used as a  <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Articles/Hybrids-Rising-Tall-White-ETs-On-Earth.html#StunDevice" target="_blank">weapon</a>.
 Hall said it could stun and even kill a Human being by using focused  
microwaves. We can only wonder if the physical after-effects of such a 
tool or  weapon are what leaves behind the telltale “<a href="http://alienjigsaw.com/gallery/Post-Alien-Abduction-Body-Marks.html" target="_blank">pencil  erasure</a>”
 type bruises. Many Abductee-Experiencers, including researchers such  
as Dr. David Jacobs and the late Budd Hopkins and Dr. Karla Turner  have
  reported these bruises (sometimes with pinholes inside of them) over 
the past three  decades. Here are photographs of the physical after 
effects the HR Team  believes these devices leave behind when they are 
used to stun or control  subjects.<br>
              </p>
              <p><br>
              </p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Tall-Whites-HP.html"></a><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Tall-Whites-HP.html"><img src="NHI%20Tall%20Whites%20Program%20on%20Earth-%20Pleiadians,%20Blond%20Nordic%20ET%20Aliens_files/Bruise-w-Pinholes.jpg" alt="ET Bruise with Pinholes" width="268" height="201" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left"></a></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">As the  case previously cited 
involving the ritual and greeting, Charles Hall’s Tall  Whites behaved 
arrogantly at times and they tended to value high ranking  officials and
 people in higher ranking social structures over those of lower  rank or
 those perceived to be from a lower socioeconomic class. This was the  
case with Hall, who only seemed to get along with the Tall Whites by 
allowing  them to refer to him as their “pet,” as we would refer to a 
dog or cat.</p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><br>
                <br>
                In a 2013 Report filed with MUFON, it appears the Tall 
Whites were seen  again. A slightly edited synopsis follows: </p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“I turned back to my truck door and
 tried to unlock it when I caught  something at the corner of my eye. I 
jumped back against the side of my truck  and about 15 feet away stood 
three people staring at me that had not been there  prior to this 
incident. There were two very attractive women and one very tall  man 
who was at least ten feet tall. All of them had  blonde hair that was 
almost white, and blue eyes.”<br>
                  <br>
“They did not say anything to me directly but I heard one of the woman’s
 voices  in my head. I know you’re probably thinking that I am crazy but
 it did happen.  She said, <em>‘[my name] please do not be  afraid. You have an important role to play if you would like to help us.’</em> I  said out loud in a shaky voice <em>‘Okay but  I don’t know how.’</em> Then the woman said, <em>‘Don’t worry, you will know in time.’ </em>Right
 after she said  that everything went black. Eventually I woke up around
 two thirty, laying  about thirty feet away from my last remembered 
position at the side of my  truck.” [7]</p>
              <p class="auto-style2">An extremely well researched case by Colin Andrews is excerpted below  from his article entitled <em>The Silbury Hill Stargate? </em>The apparent  fast pace at which these beings moved is emphasized below. </p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“The contact, who  doesn’t want to 
be named, was driving past Silbury Hill  early Monday morning (6th July 
2009) when he saw three figures in the formation  there. At first he 
thought they were forensic officers as they were dressed in  white 
coveralls. He stopped his car and approached the field. The figures were
  all over 6ft and had blond hair. They seemed to be inspecting the 
crop. When he  got to the edge of the field he heard what he 
&nbsp;believed to be a sound not dissimilar  to static electricity. This
 crackling noise seemed to be running through the  field and the crop 
was moving gently close to where the noise was moving. He  felt the hair
 on his arms and back of his neck raise up. He shouted to the  figures 
who at first ignored him, not glancing at him.  When he tried to enter 
the field they looked up and began running. He said <em>‘They ran faster
 than any man I have ever  seen. I’m no slouch but they were moving so 
fast. I looked away for a second  and when I looked back they were gone.
 I then got scared. The noise was still  around, but I got an uneasy 
feeling and headed for the car. For the rest of the  day I had a 
pounding headache I couldn’t shift.</em>’” [8]</p>

 not all be related to the same species,  and some may in fact refer to

There is indeed some overlap in the descriptions and  activities of Tall
 Whites and Blond Nordics and it would be beneficial for  readers to 
refer to the Blond Nordic page on this site for further information.</p>

              <p class="auto-style2"><a name="HGShaw" id="HGShaw"></a><strong>Stockton Evening Mail, of Stockton, California,  page 1, November 27, 1896. <em>Three Strange  Beings:</em> <em>Beings Seen on a Country Road by Colonel  H.G. Shaw and a Companion [Camille Spooner]</em></strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>They  Boarded the Airship</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>November  25, 1896</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“For more  than a week the papers 
all over the coast have been reporting the presence of  an alleged 
airship or flying machine, which many reputable people claim to have  
seen on several occasions in the heavens at night. Whether or not there 
really  is such a contrivance navigating the air the Mail is unable to 
satisfactorily  determine, but some of the papers have taken the matter 
seriously and others  have been disposed to make light of the 
statements. A couple of San Francisco  attorneys have secured a lot of 
free advertising by claiming to have clients  who have invented and 
tested successful flying ships, and the newspapers have  filled several 
columns talking about the aerial mystery.”<br>
              <br>
“The Mail  makes the above statement merely by way of preface to a most 
remarkable story  which is related by Colonel H.G. Shaw of this city, 
formerly of the Mail  editorial staff. Colonel Shaw is at present 
engaged in collecting an exhibit  for the Stockton Commercial 
Association to be displayed at the Citrus Fair  which will be held in 
Fresno  during the coming month. The gentleman was very reticent about 
relating the  circumstance, as he said he had no idea that it would 
believed by anyone, and  he was loath to appear before the public as a 
romancer or as a man who had  looked upon shoe-string when it was red. 
He tells the story as follows:” </p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Three Strange Beings</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“Were it  not for the fact that I 
was not alone when I witnessed the strange sight I  would never have 
mentioned it at all. Wednesday afternoon I went out to Lodi and 
Lockeford in company  with Camille Spooner, a young man recently arrived
 from Nevada. I went to the places mentioned in  quest of material to 
form an exhibit to represent this county at the Fresno  Citrus Fair. We 
left Lodi  on the return trip, I should judge, shortly before 6 o’clock,
 and we were  jogging along quietly when the horse stopped suddenly and 
gave a snort of  terror.”<br>
              <br>
“Looking  up we beheld three strange beings. They resembled humans in 
many respects, but  still they were not like anything I had ever seen. 
They were nearly or quite seven  feet high and very slender. We were 
both somewhat startled, as you may readily  imagine, and the first 
impulse was to drive on. The horse, however, refused to  budge, and when
 we saw that we were being regarded more with an air of  curiosity than 
anything else, we concluded to get out and investigate. I walked  up to 
where the strange looking persons were and addressed them. I asked where
  they were from. They seemed not to understand me, but began – well, 
“warbling”  expresses it better than talking. Their remarks, if such you
 would call them,  were addressed to each other, and sounded like a 
monotonous chant, inclined to  be guttural. I saw it was no use to 
attempt a conversation, so I satisfied  myself with watching and 
examining them. They seemed to take great interest in  ourselves, the 
horse and buggy, and scrutinized everything very carefully.” </p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Weighed Less Than an Ounce Each</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“While  they were thus engaged I 
was enabled to inspect them as well. As I have already  stated, they 
were seven feet in height and very slender. I noticed, further,  that 
their hands were quite small and delicate, and that their fingers were  
without nails. Their feet, however, were nearly twice as long as those 
of an  ordinary man, though they were narrow, and the toes were also 
long and slender.  I noticed, too, that they were able to use their feet
 and toes much the same as  a monkey; in fact, they appeared to have 
much better use of their feet than  their hands. I presently discovered 
that this was probably a provision of  nature. As one of then came close
 to me I reached out to touch him, and placing  my hand under his elbow 
pressed gently upward, and lo and behold I lifted him  from the ground 
with scarcely an effort. I should judge that the specific  gravity of 
the creature was less than an ounce. It was then that I observed him  
try to grasp the earth with his toes to prevent my lifting him. You can 
readily  understand that their slight weight made such a provision 
necessary, or they  might be blown away.”<br>
              <br>
“They were  without any sort of clothing, but were covered with a 
natural growth hard to  describe; it was not hair, neither was it like 
feathers, but it was as soft as  silk to the touch, and their skin was 
like velvet. Their faces and heads were  without hair, the ears were 
very small, and the nose had the appearance of  polished ivory, while 
the eyes were large and lustrous. The mouth, however, was  small, and it
 seemed to me that they were without teeth. That and other things  led 
me to believe that they neither ate nor drank, and that life was 
sustained  by some sort of gas. Each of them had swung under the left 
arm a bag to which  was attached a nozzle, and every little while one or
 the other would place the  nozzle on his mouth, at which time I heard a
 sound of escaping gas. It was much  the same sound as is produced by a 
person blowing up a football.” </p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Of Indescribable Beauty</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“From the  description I give I do 
not want you to get the idea that these creatures were  hideous. In 
appearance they were markedly the contrary. They were possessed of  a 
strange and indescribable beauty. I can express myself in no other way. 
They  were graceful to a degree, and more divinely beautiful than 
anything I ever  beheld.” <br>
“The  strangest part of the story is yet to come. It is the lights they 
carried. Each  held to his hand something about the size of a hen’s egg.
 Upon holding them up  and partly opening the hand, these substances 
emitted the most remarkable,  intense and penetrating light one can 
imagine. Notwithstanding its intensity it  had no unpleasant effect upon
 our eyes, and we found we could gaze directly at  it. It seemed to me 
to be some sort of luminous mineral, though they had  complete control 
of it.”<br>
  <br>
“Finally  they became tired of examining us and our horse and buggy, and
 then one of  them, at a signal from one who appeared to be the leader, 
attempted to lift me,  probably with the intention of carrying me away. 
Although I made not the  slightest resistance he could not move me, and 
finally the three of them tried  it without the slightest success. They 
appeared to have no muscular power  outside of being able to move their 
own limbs.” </p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><strong>Strange Airship</strong></p>
              <p class="auto-style2">“Well,  after trying in vain to 
move either of us they turned in the direction of the Woodbridge canal, 
near  which we were, and as they flashed their lights towards the bridge
 we beheld a  startling sight. There, resting in the air about twenty 
feet above the water, was an immense airship. It was 150 feet in length 
at  least, though probably not over twenty feet in diameter at the 
widest part. It  was pointed at both ends, and outside of a large rudder
 there was no visible  machinery. The three walked rapidly toward the 
ship, not as you or I walk, but  with a swaying motion, their feet only 
touching the ground at intervals of  about fifteen feet. We followed 
them as rapidly as possible, and reached the  bridge as they were about 
to embark. With a little spring they rose to the  machine, opened a door
 in the side, and disappeared within. I do not know of  what the affair 
was built, but just before it started I struck it with a rock and  it 
gave no sound. It went through the air very rapidly and expanded and  
contracted with a muscular motion, and was soon out of sight.”<br>
              <br>
“I have a theory, which, of course, is only a theory, that those we  
beheld were inhabitants of Mars, who had been sent to the earth for the 
purpose  of securing one of its inhabitants. I feel safe in asserting 
that the stories  being told by certain San Francisco  attorneys are 
clumsy fakes, and should not be given credence by anyone.”</p>
              <p class="auto-style2"><a name="MUFONTWCaseReport" id="MUFONTWCaseReport"></a><strong>The  2013 MUFON Tall  Whites Report</strong></p>
    <p class="auto-style2">“This past weekend I was spending some time 
out by Lake Arcadia.  The fraternity that I am a member of (which is 
part of a near by University)  just finished having our back to school 
get together with some of our members.  The location of the site was 
right by the shore of the lake.” <br>
                  <br>
“It was about one o’clock in the morning and I was the last one there 
and had  been by myself for around thirty minutes. It was my 
responsibility that night  to let no one drive back home while 
intoxicated and make sure the camp site was  in good shape when we were 
done. As a result of my duties that night I was  completely sober and 
had not been drinking or using any drugs.”<br>
  <br>
“Right after I loaded the last bag of trash in the back of my truck I 
had this  strange urge to look at the lake. The best way to describe 
that feeling was as  if I had been day dreaming. There was nothing 
unusual going on out on then all  of the sudden there was a bright 
glowing light under the water. At this  particular distance I could tell
 exactly how large the circle was but it was  big.”<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
“The shape was circular and had a light green/yellowish glow with 
occasional  pulsating reed and blue lights. I starred at it dumbfounded 
as it was moving  slowly under the water from one side of the lake to 
the opposite side. The  object moved from one side and back to the other
 two or three times for about  five minutes then it stopped almost near 
the center  of the lake. The object glowed brighter and brighter than 
shot straight out of  the water and into the sky.”<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
“After that I turned around and ran as fast as I could to my truck. Once
 I got  to my truck I stopped and fumbled around in my pockets for a 
couple of seconds  looking for my keys and seemingly out of no where a 
bright light appeared above  and slightly behind me.” <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
“I turned around to see what was behind me and there was this giant 
ship. It  wasn’t a saucer shaped one that everyone talks about but it 
had more of a cake  shape. It hadn’t landed but just hovered around 
twenty to thirty feet off the  ground for a couple of seconds. Then shot
 back up into the sky.”<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
“I turned back to my truck door and tried to unlock it when I caught 
something  at the corner of my. I jumped back against the side of my 
truck and about 15  feet away stood three people staring at me that had 
not been there prior to  this incident. There were two very attractive 
women and one very tall man that was at least ten feet high. All of them
 had blonde hair that  was almost white and blue eyes.”<br>
  <br>
“They did not say anything to me directly but I heard one of the woman’s
 voice in my head. I know your probably thinking that I am  crazy but it
 did happen. She said, “(my name) please do not be afraid. You have  an 
important role to play if you would like to help us.” I said out loud in
 a  shaky voice “okay but I don’t know how?” Then the woman said, “don’t
 worry you  will know in time.” Right after she said that everything
