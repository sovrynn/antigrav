              <p align="center" class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left">Mantis or Insectoid appearing beings have 
led the Abductee-Experiencer phenomenon from the beginning of our modern
 day awareness of it. They appear to be at the higher, if not the 
highest end of the ET hierarchy since they are most always described as 
overseeing or have a supervisory role in the abduction procedure 
process. This is the case whether it is a medical procedure or Human ET 
Hybrid interaction. This takes place during situations involving baby or
 child presentations all the way to sexual instruction, interaction and 
possible telepathic absorption of emotions and sensations. In many such 
encounters, there is normally a Mantis or Insectoid being directing and 
observing the other beings and people involved.</p>
              <p>Regarding these unusual beings and these unusual 
circumstances, abduction researcher and licensed clinical social worker 
John Carpenter asked over two decades years ago: “Why would anyone 
imagine a large bug directing an abduction experience? Is this something
 we would hope for or desire to see?  Subjects sense a higher level of 
wisdom and functioning in this type of entity. Whatever its purpose or 
origin, we certainly need further study.” [1] </p>
              <p>More than twenty years have passed since John Carpenter
 and other researchers made this observation. Contact between the Mantis
 or Insectoid beings and Humans has continued and we have learned much 
more from the Abductee-Experiencers who have consciously recalled 
memories of being in their presence, and of being “operated” on; of 
being studied by them and from being shown or accidentally remembering 
some of their technology.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Mantis-Insectoids-HP.html"><img src="NHI,%20Mantis,%20Mantids,%20Insectoids%20Alien%20Abduction%20Program_files/HR-TOR-Bending-Mantis-Crpd.jpg" alt="Mantid ET Alien HybridsRising.com" width="274" height="369" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right"></a>As
 Carpenter and others were learning about the Mantis beings, a 
Researcher-Experiencer published an excellent description of their 
appearance: “These Beings have long, narrow faces, with long, narrow, 
large eyes,  sharply slanted upward and outward in an almost narrow-V 
position, giving an  almost insect-like appearance. This comparison is 
heightened by the  Praying-Mantis types’ extremely thin, long torsos, 
long, extremely thin arms  which are usually crooked into a sharp bend 
at the mid-joint, with the hand and  fingers sloping almost vertically 
downward from the wrist, and legs also bent at an almost right-angle at 
the mid-joint, creating a crouched pose. The overall effect is the 
characteristic ‘Praying Mantis’ look. It should be noted that 
experiencers feel that this type is no insect, but rather an 
intelligent,  gentle spirited… and jerky moving, human-like life form. 
There are both males  and females.” [2]</p>
              <p>The Mantis being pictured on the right was described by
 the Abductee-Experiencer as a female and her demeanour was positive and
 inquisitive. Her eyes were dark  brown to near black. This particular 
Mantis used what is sometimes referred to as a camouflage response or a 
screen image to make herself appear a less  threatening being, and as 
the Experiencer was not afraid, she then allowed herself  to be viewed 
up close and thoroughly by the subject. This included intentionally 
allowing the Abductee-Experiencer to observe her genitalia [not shown in
 image] which were a very light colour. This was obviously a teaching 
moment for the subject, who still believes this being was completely 
positive and nonthreatening.  Experiencer named <a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Articles/Hybrids-Rising-Double-Abduction-Art.html" target="_blank">Danion Kell</a>
 has also encountered a Mantis being like this one and he also felt very
 positive feelings and emotions from this type of being. [3]</p>
              <p>Another well known case is that of artist and 
Abductee-Experiencer David Huggins and his provides an interesting and 
alternative view into these beings. One important note to mention before
 we discuss David Huggins’ Mantis beings is the ones he has seen over 
his lifetime did not have black skin and appeared more brown-green in 
colour. His also wore garments from time to time. It is possible the 
mantis beings Huggins interacted with were Hybrids of some type, but we 
do not know this with 100% certainty. Just as many other beings have 
variations in height, skin tone and eye colour, so too may be the case 
with the Mantis Insectoid beings.<br>
                <br>
                David Huggins’ Mantis beings behave in a more 
controlling fashion during his encounters. David ofttimes depicts his 
Mantis overseer without clothing, but it is sometimes seen wearing a 
cape or a cloak whilst other beings and Experiencers move around naked. 
His Mantis behaves in what some have termed a voyeuristic manner, 
observing the sexual encounters between Huggins  and his personal 
Hybrid,** who is called Crescent. The HR Team ponders the idea: Did this
 Mantis merely observe the sexual acts between Huggins and  Crescent or 
did this Mantis have a desire, or perhaps even a need, to  
telepathically absorb the emotions and feelings experienced between the 
two? Because  we know they have witnessed sexual acts between Huggins 
and Crescent many times  before, we can be fairly certain the Mantis was
 not there simply to learn. This is a rather peculiar aspect of these 
types of beings, or at least the Mantises  with the brown-green skin. 
This and other cases, is why the HR Team believes the Mantises (and 
perhaps other beings) can telepathically absorb emotions and  physical 
sensations experienced by Abductee-Experiencers. We do not know if this 
is accomplished solely by biological telepathic means or enhanced with 
neural technology or a combination of the two. This would entail 
biological manipulation with Abductee-Experiencers as well as the 
Mantises and Insectoids themselves. [4]<br>
                <br>
                From studying other abduction cases as well as David 
Huggins’, it appears that a Mantis type being [or a tall Grey] when 
present, is normally the one in control as an “Overseer,”  “Leader” or 
“Diplomat.” An example from David’s case is when the Hybrid females  
wanted Huggins to stay with them and not be returned to Earth. They 
asked the Mantis being for permission for Huggins to stay, but the 
Mantis said this was not to be allowed. In other words, the Mantis 
beings are definitely the ones in charge.<br>
                <br>
                Below is another  excellent example of how the Mantises 
appear to have an exoskeleton as the previous image illustrates, as well
 as the role they  play. This account comes from the well known UFO*BC 
site from an  Abductee-Experiencer using the name “Jim.” We would at 
this time like to thank our friends at UFO*BC for their diligence in 
publishing the UFO*BC website and for allowing us to quote from a few of
 their articles. We encourage our readers  to visit their site, and we 
have provided several links in our Sources for this article so you may 
learn more about the fascinating cases they have published relating to 
Mantis beings.<br>

                <br>
“I woke up  at about 2:30 in the morning to find a tall praying mantis 
looking being and a cloaked being by the side of my bed. I thought to 
myself ‘What crazy dream is this?’ The cloaked being looked at me from 
beneath its hood, revealing its  black skin, which appeared leathery and
 reflecting light much like a beetles skin. I shut my eyes, thinking 
this must be a realistic dream! But when I re-opened my eyes, the 
figures were unfortunately still there.”<br>
  <br>
“The cloaked figure looked up to the tall praying mantis type, as if it 
was confused as to what actions it should take next. The praying mantis 
turned its head towards the hooded one and made a series of high-pitched
 clicking sounds. I sensed this was the one in command, possibly the 
other was some kind of security guard. It’s at this point I realized, 
I’m definitely not dreaming, I can hear them…”<br>
  <br>
“All I recall was that it was tall. At least 7 foot, it had to bend its 
neck because of the height of the ceiling. Its head was pointed with 
large eyes. Its  for-arms were extremely long and moved in a jerky 
fashion. The cloaked figure was closer, crouching by my bed, so I 
couldn’t tell how tall it was, but I could clearly see that it was 
wearing some kind of overlapping ridged amour? Including a metallic 
looking breastplate that had a series of circles on it. Its head was 
dome-like with emotionless facial features. Its eyes were large and 
surrounded again by detailed ridges. It acted in a way that reminded me 
of a robot or insect.”<br>
  <br>
“…At this point, the mantis bent its upper body, over my bed and 
directly above me. In its hand it was holding a long metal object that 
looked like a needle. A  green light shot directly from the needle and 
into my right eye. Maybe it’s a laser, I am not sure, but I do know it 
felt very painful. I could see all the veins from my eye, the same 
effect you get when an Optician checks your eyes. I screamed but no 
noise came out. I then felt something stick into my skull! I’m  not sure
 what because by that time I had my eyes closed. I pretended to sleep 
and went into deep panic! My mind was racing at a million miles per 
hour. I heard a great whooshing sound and when I next reopened my eyes 
thankfully they had gone.” [5]<br>

              <p>Another  well known case involving Mantis beings is 
that of Simon Parkes, a former Whitby  British Councillor who has gone 
public with his Contact Experiences. He describes the Mantis beings as 
very proud beings who are capable of exerting a strong commanding 
presence. They are also “very technical and think like a chess 
computer.” Simon Parkes believes the Mantis beings who wear purple robes
 are the most senior. In other words, he, like the HR Team, believes 
they are at the top of the ET hierarchy. [6]<br>
              </p>
              <p align="center"><br>
                <strong>“Now Do You Understand?”</strong></p>
              <p><br>
                Returning to the account involving “Jim,” a Mantis being
 shows a holograph of Earth to the Abductee-Experiencer. Each time he 
touches the Earth holograph, he sees and is given information about a 
particular geographic location. Each time this occurs, the effects are 
different, yet the outcome is the same: He is shown destruction due to 
the actions of Humans. The Mantis asks him at different times during the
 difficult experience: “Now do you understand?”  [7]</p>
              <p>The lesson these beings are apparently trying to 
communicate – and the  HR Team believes many have done this quite well –
 is that Humans are causing  much more pain and destruction than they 
know, and Humans kill what they do not understand and ofttimes kill what
 they simply fear. This is a recurring theme for Abductee-Experiencers 
and everyone will tell you, these types of encounters are very difficult
 to endure; therefore, you the reader-Human, should take heed. We highly
 recommend that you to read all three parts of “Jim’s” interesting 
accounts involving Mantis beings. There are also excellent illustrations
 and in the end, we are provided a representation of what this 
particular being looked like: Black skin, with a chest like armour (an 
exoskeleton) who was wearing a cape and donning a symbol that appeared 
to be a golden snake. Buzzing and clicking sounds are associated with 
these beings as well as telepathic interrogation like tactics during 
subsequent visits.<br>
</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Mantis-Insectoids-HP.html"><img src="NHI,%20Mantis,%20Mantids,%20Insectoids%20Alien%20Abduction%20Program_files/HR-TOR-Hybrid-Mantis-Insectoid.jpg" alt="3 Mantis ET- Aliens:HybridsRising.com" width="445" height="263" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left"></a>The
 telepathic interrogation can be just as intense as seeing a hologram of
 Earth and watching our planet be destroyed. This is an interrogative 
type of interaction that is not uncommon for Abductee-Experiencers to 
have to endure and it is normally carried out by Mantis-Insectoid type 
beings. Their demeanour however, ranges from loving and gentle to what 
we have just discussed. These variations, we believe, are due to the 
amount of information an Abductee-Experiencer remembers and how much of 
that knowledge they share with  others, especially those going public 
with their experiences. They are deeply  personal to the 
Abductee-Experiencer and have been described by well known  subjects 
such as Simon Parkes, Joe and Linda Montaldo, AJ, as well as other 
people with whom the HR Team has interviewed but who have requested 
anonymity. </p>
              <p>Below is another excerpt from the UFO*BC website that 
demonstrates the Mantises’ high level of technological, including 
medical expertise. This extreme level of technology has been 
demonstrated by the Greys and by the Hybrids as well. It is  ofttimes 
compared to “star trek” level technology and as if these beings are 
using “interdimensional” instruments and equipment. </p>
              <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
              <p>“I stood there helpless for the longest time, not 
knowing what to do but feeling a real sense of panic. Something had to 
be done quickly. All of a sudden there were two Beings that appeared 
next to my friend. They seemed to push me right aside and silently went 
right to work on her, like skilled surgeons. They stood to her left, 
standing together and working furiously on my friend. I had no idea who 
they were, what they were doing, but the first thing I  thought of was 
‘are they aliens’??? I stood there and watched…I thought they  looked 
like Praying Mantises. Alien Praying Mantises…”<br>
                  <br>
  “Then I focused on my friend and saw her head was split wide open, 
like these aliens sliced it perfectly open. I saw freshly sliced raw 
flesh and these  Aliens/Praying Mantis were busily removing pieces of 
bone, rock or whatever  from her brain. This did not look anything like 
what I would imagine the inside of a brain to look but it was just such a
 clean cut. These two Alien/Praying Mantis worked quickly, without 
speaking one word. I seemed to black out and don’t remember any more of 
it.” [8]<br>
              <br>
              </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>New  Abilities</strong><br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>Ofttimes Abductee-Experiencers will tell us they have 
gained new psychic abilities. These feelings of new found abilities have
 been recently  demonstrated in Kathleen Marden’s and Denise Stoner’s <em>Commonalities</em>
 report. Out of a total of 50 Abductee-Experiencers who  answered the 
question regarding an increase in psychic abilities,&nbsp; </p>
              <p>“…72% stated that they are  more sensitive or intuitive
 than they were prior to contact. 79% stated that they developed new 
psychic abilities after a contact experience. One person reported that 
they have always been psychic and another noted that his or her psychic 
abilities increased.”</p>
              <p>What follows is an excerpt of  an account demonstrating
 their high level of technology. We also revisit this subject in the 
next document with another demonstration of their medical technology. 
For those of you whose curiosity we have roused, the HR Team  believes 
there are Mantis Hybrid beings and we are calling them Tall Blacks due 
to their black skin and certain physical characteristics including their
 tall, eloquent stature. </p>
              <p align="left">The following account may seem “unreal” to
 some, but we can tell you that this level of technology  appears to be 
the “status quo” for all of the beings described in the 
Abductee-Experiencer Phenomenon.<br> 
                <br>
  “My  Praying Mantis figure was very kind to me. He urged me to stay 
calm and  telepathically reassured me everything would be alright. My 
right eye was  removed by a device that came down from the white 
ceiling. I started to really panic but the Mantis kept me from really 
freaking out. Then it was replaced. The Mantis also told me 
telepathically that I was a special person who would really make a 
difference here on earth. I am now 44 years old and have made no real 
significant differences to the human race. I think he may have just 
wanted to reassure a child at the time….”<br>
  <br>
  “I have retained 1 thing from my encounter. I still have the power to 
see major global disasters before they happen. I only report them to 
either my fiancé or my close family members because I know anyone else 
would just call me crazy. But now they believe me for the most part. 
Because when I see something clearly and  tell them, it always happens.”

 We believe there is a high probability the Mantis  beings have created 
Hybrid versions of themselves using alternate DNA including DNA  from 
Human Abductee-Experiencers. Our next document covers them in as much 
detail as we can possibly provide with  the knowledge we have at this 
time. We hope this document has been educational  and helpful in your 
search for answers about the Mantis-Insectoids. These are by no means 
the only examples of interaction between Humans and Mantis  appearing 
beings, so we encourage you to seek further and educate yourself about 
the contact which is occurring on our planet. Remember, there is a lot 
of  misinformation (false or inaccurate information that is spread  
unintentionally) as well as disinformation (false information that is  
spread intentionally) on the Internet, so seek wisely.</p>

              <p>“We established a minimum  sample size of 50 completed 
questionnaires for abduction experiencers (AE) and 25 for non-abduction 
experiencers (NAE). There were 54 participants in the “UFO Abduction 
Experiencer Questionnaire”, but 4 questionnaires could not be tallied  
because they were too incomplete.”</p>
