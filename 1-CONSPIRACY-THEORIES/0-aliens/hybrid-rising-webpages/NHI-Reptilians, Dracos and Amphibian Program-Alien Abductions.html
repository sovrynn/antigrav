              <br>
              There is an extraordinarily rich history regarding 
Reptilian appearing alien beings dating back to the oldest known 
creation stories involving the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki were ancient 
deities of Sumerian, Assyrian, Akkadian and Babylonian culture. You can 
 read a very basic overview of the Anunnaki at Wikipedia’s site and from
 there of course, you will be able to locate additional information. Our
 Sources area in this document also provides links to their pages 
listing Reptilian and Amphibian humanoids throughout Human history, the 
Dagon as well as ufologically related links to similar beings. Due to 
the number of historical overviews that  are currently available, this 
document will focus on their apparent activities involving the Modern 
Day Contact phenomenon, which the HR Team is defining as beginning 70 
years ago. [1-2]</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

                It is prudent to  bear in mind that not everyone 
believes the Anunnaki had or have Reptilian  traits or that the 
Reptilians are even related to the Anunnaki. Physicist Michio Kaku does 
not believe the Anunnaki or any other Advanced Intelligence for that 
matter, can be classified into a category or civilization type such as 
Type One, Type Two or Type Three, stating,<br>
                <br> 
                <br>
“The immensity of the Universe, the Galactic Mind works differently and 
we’ll talk about the  ‘Galactic Mind,’ the ‘Universal Mind,’ and the 
‘Supersymmetric Mind’… [These classifications] do not apply to the 
Anunnaki and other highly developed galactic civilizations simply 
because the human mind simply cannot understand the extremely high and 
extraordinary standards / levels of technology and science of 
civilizations which are millions, perhaps billions of years ahead of 
us.” [3]</p>
              <p><br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, and  from the same source, the 
prolific author Maximillien De  Lafayette goes much further outlining an
 entire future agenda concerning these  beings, and it is frightful 
indeed. Some of the areas he concentrates on, besides providing the year
 of their arrival, are the Anunnaki’s “spaceships and stargates 
appearing over major cities,” “clashes with Humans,” and the “Anunnaki’s
  classification of Humanity into three groups, regarding their level of
 ‘contamination.’”  [4]</p>

              <p align="center" class="auto-style31">&nbsp;</p>
              <p> Reptilians and Dracos (or Draconians) may be two 
different types of beings, or they could be the same species with the 
same amount of variation among them that we have seen with the  Greys 
and even among Humans, i.e. physical characteristics of height, skin 
colour and texture. As with many other Extraterrestrials, their 
activities and physical characteristics overlap quite frequently and 
they are ofttimes seen together.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Generally speaking, the Dracos are taller than the 
Reptilians and are sometimes seen with wings that appear atrophied and 
are not used for actual flight. Both types of beings wear capes with 
hoods at times to conceal their appearance and, generally speaking, they
 are described as the most alien appearing beings Abductee-Experiencers 
report.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The height of  Reptilians range from approximately 6 to 8
 feet, and their two hands consist of four-fingered claws with webbing 
and ofttimes external ribbing is visible on their chests and backs. They
 stand upright and have smooth to rough appearing lizard-like scales 
instead of skin. Their skin colour is greenish to brownish. Dracos are 
reported as tall 10 -12 feet in height and their skin appears as gray 
and mottled. Abductee-Experiencer Ken Bakeman has seen several Dracos 
with white skin, which he refers to as albino Dracos. There have been 
approximately three reports of Reptilians with blue skin of which the HR
 Team is aware and one of the more well known of these is that of Erica 
Goetsch, who reports positive encounters with them. While the blue skin 
might seem rare or an aberration to some, the HR Team believe these 
beings’ skin probably has chameleon characteristics and they are able to
 adapt to their surroundings and circumstances. Their emotions may also 
be expressed by the changing colour of their skin. [5]</p>
              <p><br>
                <br>
                <strong><a href="https://www.hybridsrising.com/Hybrid-Project/Hybrids-Rising-Reptilian-Dracos-HP.html" target="_blank"><img src="NHI-Reptilians,%20Dracos%20and%20Amphibian%20Program-Alien%20Abductions_files/HR-Reptilian-Eye.jpg" alt="Reptilian Eye - Extraterrestrial Eye:HybridsRising.com" width="359" height="261" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="left"></a></strong>Reptilians’
 faces  are described as a cross between humanoid and snake or lizard 
like. Their heads  have a central ridge coming down from the top to a 
snout like nose which makes their cranial-to-facial appearance casques 
like. Their eyes are described as being cat like with vertical elongated
 gold irises and black pupils. Sometimes their  irises, and ofttimes the
 entire eye has small red splotches similar to what in Humans would be 
termed small subconjunctival haemorrhages. This red blotchiness makes 
their eyes appear all the more intense.</p>
              <p><br>
                <br>
                Some Abductee-Experiences report Reptilians as extremely
 calm, caring and loving, but they are also often  characterized as 
repulsive and grotesque, with their behaviour being described sometimes 
as “disgusting.” Their mannerisms are intrusive and forceful. Female 
Experiencers have reported both rape and pleasurable sex by male 
Reptilians, but it is difficult to understand how this is 
physiologically possible. The male sexual organ of the Reptilian is 
tucked into the body and covered with a flap of skin, and when their 
reproductive organ is described, it is much too large to be “compatible”
 with a human female. In other words, one would think it would be 
physiologically very difficult, if not impossible for sexual intercourse
 or rape to occur in this manner. [6]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This in no way implies certain subjects did not, in some
 manner, experience the act; it is a mystery however as to how this is 
physiologically possible without leaving a Human female physically 
damaged and requiring surgical repair. It is crucial to remember, as 
with many telepathic beings, there is the telepathic ability, more than 
likely enhanced using a neural implant, or via the optic nerve pathways 
to induce the Abductee-Experiencer to achieve orgasm by stimulating 
certain brain  pathways, and this would explain the sensation(s) they 
report having experienced.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Explaining why some Abductee-Experiencers come away from
 these encounters with large claw marks on their bodies, including their
 inner thighs, as well as vaginal soreness could  be explained by a 
similar action perpetrated upon them but by different means. Rape does 
not solely involve a biological body part in order to be “rape.” In the 
end, the rape act or sexual act that occurs to the Experiencer feels 
very real and therefore <em>is</em> very real and should  not be 
discounted or belittled. There is often great trauma reported after 
encounters with Reptilian beings by Abductee-Experiencers, especially 
women. [7]<br>

                <strong>Reptilian  Hybridization</strong></p>
              <p><br>
                Our research persuades the HR Team that Reptilian 
appearing beings are  most likely as involved and have an interest in 
the DNA of Humans as much as other beings who are coming to Earth. Some 
theorize the Reptilian line has always been on Earth and they are its 
original inhabitants, or at least have  been here much longer than 
Humans. If they are in fact the Anunnaki, they have apparently staked 
their claim to humanity and to the Earth in various ancient texts, most 
notably the Babylonian Creation Mythos. [8]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>The Best at What They Do</strong><br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>What the HR Team finds of utmost importance regarding the Reptilians is their <em>expert</em>
 ability to use screen imagery and techniques such as camouflage and 
apparent shape shifting  abilities. From our research, they appear to be
 the best of the best when it  comes to subterfuge utilizing camouflage 
techniques. It is not only the Blond Nordics who can transform into 
Reptilians, but Reptilians have also reportedly transformed into Blond 
Nordics. We are in fact determining that some of the Blond Nordic 
reports are of <em>Reptilian</em> influence.<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>We must again ask: Why do they do this and what is 
their true physiological form? Are Reptilians really Reptilians and are 
Blond Nordics  really as they appear? Could both species be something 
completely different  from the image they choose Abductee-Experiencers 
to see them? Additionally, it  has been theorized that Reptilians mated 
with ancient Blond Nordics and what we are encountering today as Blond 
Nordics are actually Hybrids of the Reptilians  and original Blond 
Nordics. According to David Icke, the Anunnaki, who are  deities of 
Sumerian, Assyrian, Akkadian and Babylonian culture, “bred with the  
Blond Nordics to produce a race of Human slave masters” [some might say 
 monsters] “called the Aryans.” Icke claims they also retain many 
Reptilian  traits, not so much physical traits, but <em>ideological</em> ones. [9]<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>As an interesting side note regarding David Icke: It is
 apparent, if his  Wikipedia page is accurate at all, that Icke has 
experienced the typical ordeal  of having his career destroyed and his 
life path changed by this phenomenon. This is something the HR Team has 
seen over and over again. When a person becomes aware, their lives and 
careers and many times, their marriages take a  dramatic course change, 
and not always for the better. To paraphrase an old  quote, “You can 
never go home again.” This occurs so often that it can be  considered a 
“staple” or fundamental component of the Contact Phenomenon.<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Human  DNA – Again</strong><br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>As mentioned previously, Reptilians appear to be nearly
 as involved in using  Human DNA in the creation of their own particular
 version of Human Hybrids as the Greys and those beings who act as their
 helpers, aides, assistants, biologically created drones, or whatever 
other designations people have given them. As a review, these include 
the Greys of Type I through Types IV, as well as the Synthoids; Brown 
Dwarfs and various stages of Hybrids. [10]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                An example of the Reptilian-Dracos’ interest in Human 
DNA was clearly indicated in a 2006 case involving Reptilians when an 
Abductee-Experiencer observed a Human woman who had just given birth:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
  “She appeared to be in her late twenties and had a fair complexion and
 long blond hair. She had on a light blue hospital top and a sheet was 
covering her up to her waist. She looked very depressed or was in a 
trance as she was staring off and looking downward to her left and away 
from the doctors, nurses and her baby.”<br>
  <br>
  <br>
                The witness stated the doctors and nurses seemed pleased
 about the birth of this woman’s baby and that salt or brine water was 
required for its  survival. Interestingly, the baby was inside of a 
whitish, semi opaque, bubble-like membrane that was approximately 18 
inches in diameter, and the  infant was visible within this apparent 
“external womb.” It was placed next to the woman with the umbilical cord
 or some kind of tube still attached. There was also fluid inside of the
 womb containing the foetus or baby.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the doctors told the Abductee-Experiencer about 
this woman’s baby, stating to her telepathically and somewhat 
commandingly and in a deep “voice:”&nbsp; <em>“The child is a boy and the man of the child is a Dargon”</em> [11 - Dagon]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              It is apparent this foetus or baby was part Human and part
 something else from the description of the Human mother and the 
artificial womb that lay next to her. Could this baby have been a Hybrid
 and in fact part <em>Dagon</em>?  Historically, the beings called the 
Dagon were described as being very different from Humans of today in 
that they were “half humanoid and half fish.”  Another name for these 
beings is The Nommo, an alleged species of amphibious beings who are 
said to have come to Earth from the Sirius star system and were 
responsible for the creation of Humans through genetic engineering. If 
you have read all of the articles in this section in the order they have
 been presented, you may rightfully ask: How many times do we need to 
hear the same story of  beings coming from other planets and 
manipulating the DNA of Humans and creating offspring before we admit 
these seemingly obvious events are irrefutably tied together with our 
own <em>Human </em>Mythos? Perhaps the ancient histories that 
“scientific” and “sceptical”  people refer to as Myths are not so 
mythical after all; if they are, then our present day Human existence 
might be deemed the same.<br>
              <br>

              <p align="center"><br>
                <strong>Dracos</strong></p>

 HR  Team believes the Dracos are most likely at the top of the 
Reptilian hierarchy  and are thusly associated with Amphibian appearing 
beings as well. In a  different encounter, this same case of an 
Abductee-Experiencer involves being told  the following unmistakable 
message while on board their vessel [referring to the subject’s DNA]:<br>
                <br>
              <br>
                <em>“We prefer to have  your permission. It is better 
when you agree on your own and are not coerced, but we can transform you
 by force if necessary.” </em>[12]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                What is most  interesting about this account is the 
Reptilians, who were also present, had their enormous craft equipped 
with a canal system containing water, or some type of liquid for 
Amphibian appearing humanoid beings.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
“The [Dracos] called themselves ‘<em>the Cacuma -- / --“Kakuma -- / --‘”</em> <a href="http://alienjigsaw.com/et-essays/Reptilian-Dracos-ET-Visitations.html" target="_blank">[12-a]</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the last two syllables of their name (designated with -- 
 / --) were not remembered by the Abductee-Experiencer, although they 
were  keenly aware that if they were to allow themselves to simply be 
touched by the Dracos beings, it could affect or alter their own, Human 
DNA. It was therefore believed to be of the utmost importance for the 
subject to maintain a safe distance of at least one meter from them at 
all times.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other examples of the Reptilians’ ability to physically transform, or at
 least make Humans perceive them as shape shifters follow. Remember, 
these beings are the best of the best at what they do and it is for this
 reason the HR Team believes the Reptilians <em>allowed</em> these individuals to see and remember – what we are referring to as <em>demonstrations</em> – of their abilities.</p>
              <p><br>
                <strong>Example</strong><br>
                <br>
“It was night-time and I was getting ready for bed and right in front of
 me appeared a tall, muscular male with blond hair. As soon as I 
realized he was there, he either made me see him as a Reptilian or he 
transformed into a Reptilian with a similar stature. When I realized he 
was really a Reptilian I  understood why his body was so massive. I 
perceived him to be a Nordic, but he wasn’t a Nordic at all.” [13]<br>
<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example</strong><br>
                <br>
“I went through a door or portal of some kind and I saw a blond, 
blue-eyed male with a kind looking face. He stood about six feet tall 
and had a  medium-build. I walked up to him and approached him, but 
decided to walk around  and behind him. When I did, I saw that the back 
of this male was very different  than what I saw when I was facing him. 
His shoulders from the back were wider by about four or five inches than
 normal human shoulders. His entire back was  ribbed like a reptile’s 
with the ribs closer together on the upper part of his  back and then 
spreading out a bit lower down his back. The skin was leathery. It was 
not human skin. I was surprised to see this, but completely accepting of
 it.” [14]<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>Example</strong><br>
  <br>
“I saw this kind and loving male being with very short white hair. He 
had large round green eyes that were brilliantly beautiful. He was 
gentle and kind  and he had an unusual animal with him that he let me 
touch. Then he sat down in such a way so as to allow me to see his back 
as if he were showing it to me. I saw his backbone and it had a ridge on
 the upper portion of it and off of it I could see ribbing or bone that 
protruded. It was as if he wanted me to see this  part of him. It was so
 different from what I saw when he first allowed me to see him, but I 
wasn’t afraid. I think he did this very slowly so I wouldn’t be afraid 
of what he really looked like. Now that I think about it, his back 
looked very reptile like…” [15]<br>
<br>
<br>
The following account is an example of the “forced respect” the Reptilians require as well as their commanding presence.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>Example</strong><br>
  <br>
“As I walked, I recognized the familiar wide hallways of their craft 
with the bare interiors  that I have seen so many times. As I continued 
to walk, I approached  three male Reptilians. I looked at the being who 
appeared to be  the leader. He was a Reptilian and he was in a seated 
position. The only clothing I saw was a cape and the rest of his body 
was unclothed. He sat with his legs partially spread out and I could see
 his genitals. I saw two very large, dark gray testicles, but I didn’t 
want to see any more so I looked away. I was repulsed by his behavior. 
As I looked away from him, I was forced to telepathically listen to what
 he had to say. As I looked to my left, I saw two shorter Reptilians…”<br>
<br>
<br>
“The other two appeared to be shorter than the male who was sitting and 
wearing the cape. They had very dark brown, scaly skin that looked very 
thick, almost like an armour  plate. It was not smooth like a snake’s 
skin, but rougher with slight protrusions and somewhat shiny. Their 
demeanour was smug and they acted  superior like.”<br>
<br>
<br>
“The display was a  holographic device and it depicted Earth scenery. I 
had to listen to them because they demanded my respect. This is their 
nature. They are very imposing beings and they command, or rather <em>demand</em> respect, especially when a human is in their presence.” [16]<br>
<br>
<br>
The following account is from Ken Bakeman and it is also included so the
 reader to gain a feel for the commanding presence these beings emit and
 possibly some of the activities they are engaged in.<br>
<br>
<br>
  <strong>Example</strong><br>
  <br>
“The situation I found myself in was that of a prisoner.&nbsp;There were
 a dozen or more young men, looking to be in their early 20’s, who like 
me were sitting on a long bench.&nbsp;We were all  handcuffed and 
connected together by a long cable strung through the cuffs and attached
 securely to the wall.&nbsp;I looked at these guys and saw their heads 
lowered in a position of surrender.&nbsp;There was a green Reptilian 
with a dull yellow colored belly standing near the interior 
doorway.&nbsp;Standing about 6’ tall, he wore a round medallion around 
his thick neck…This creature was giving us conscripts, a searing lecture
 about our mandatory allegiance to what he telepathically called the 
‘Battle.’” [17]<br>

 is apparent from the previous discussion, Amphibian beings have been  
seen in association with Reptilians, and seminal descriptions of what 
they look  like follow. They are not the same species as the 
Reptilian-Dracos, but the HR  Team hypothesizes they are somehow 
connected, perhaps in a symbiotic manner or perhaps in a nurturing 
capacity that exists between their species. They could also be as 
captives as the original Blond Nordics were described by Icke and 
others, and are forcibly being used in a similar fashion as 
Abductee-Experiencers in the hybridization process.<br>
              <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example</strong><br>
                <br>
“The child had spots on it or mottled skin sort of like some of the 
Reptilians…there was a lot of water around and it looked like the inside
 had a lot of steps or long levels that looked like steps with water 
running down them…I held the child because they wanted me to make sure 
it stayed safe while we were being given a demonstration…” [18]<br>
              <br>
              </p>
              <p>If you can imagine one of the beings in the lower part 
of this image as  a young child without hair, an example of what the 
Reptilian Hybrid child looked like can be viewed <a href="http://www.kesara.org/uploads/2/6/7/3/2673733/519446.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. [19]<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Example</strong><br>
                  <br>
“I was shown two amphibian appearing infants as well as an adult 
amphibian. They were with the Reptilians. Another infant was inside a 
special liquid filled tank that was open at the top. The amphibian 
looked happy and well cared for. She even smiled at me, but I didn’t see
 teeth. Two other  amphibian tots looked like the younger ones and they 
had brown eyes.” [20]<br>
              <br>
              </p>
              <p>The canal system the Abductee-Experiencer saw contained
 what they saw as a male Amphibian humanoid. His arms appeared to be 
only as long as a Human’s arm if it ended at the elbow and the subject 
was at first terrified, believing its arms had been intentionally 
severed to keep it docile. On the other hand, since this canal contained
 water or a liquid, it’s possible the arms extended  farther and were 
obscured by the water in the canal. For this reason, we have  no idea of
 what its hands looked like or how many, if any, digits it had.</p>
              <p class="style2">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="left"><img src="NHI-Reptilians,%20Dracos%20and%20Amphibian%20Program-Alien%20Abductions_files/HR-Amphibian.jpg" alt="Amphibian Extraterrestrial:HybridsRising.com" width="396" height="243" hspace="8" vspace="4" align="right">The
 canal system appeared to extend throughout the craft, or at least,  as 
far as the subject could see. It was of modern construction and appeared
 to have been created solely for the Amphibian being (or beings) on 
board the Reptilian  craft, which was said to have been exceptionally 
large and spacious. [21] The presence of water or a liquid always seems 
to be associated with the Amphibian humanoids, which makes sense since 
the largest group of amphibians on Earth (frogs) require moist 
environments as well. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                No matter what race or species of Extraterrestrial or 
Advanced Intelligences we consider in this vast puzzle, the main 
underlying theme is Human DNA. They are all very interested in locating 
it, acquiring it, and using it. The one single common outcome of their 
use of Human DNA is the creation and maintenance of life. The HR Team  
believes there is something of <em>them</em> in us. There is potentially something of ALL of these beings in us:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>“All Humans contain alien DNA, but not all Humans contain specific types of alien DNA.”</em><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Alien Abduction researcher and artist David Chace is the
 one person (civilian at  least) who probably understands the 
Reptilians’ physiology better than anyone. A keen admirer of the 
reptilian Earth species since childhood, Chace has been studying 
accounts of Reptilians for about two decades and he has created some 
wonderful  illustrations of them. Ken Bakeman is another man who knows a
 lot about Reptilians especially the Dracos. We encourage you to read 
both men’s views since they are somewhat different. Please see our 
Sources for their links.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
              Another  artist who works closely with 
Abductee-Experiencers is Kesara Dennett. Kesara has an apparent 
Amphibian Extraterrestrial in Water that can be viewed <a href="http://www.kesara.org/uploads/2/6/7/3/2673733/1863654_orig.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.
 This being is much more muscular and has stronger features than the one
 we have imaged in this document, but there is an obvious association 
with water and it has both Amphibian and Reptilian characteristics. This
 is another apparent Amphibian being. Notice the similarities between 
this being and the Reptilians. <a href="http://www.kesara.org/uploads/2/6/7/3/2673733/3589492_orig.jpg" target="_blank">View  image</a> </p>

              We close  this article and the HR Team’s <em>Hybrid  Project</em>
 encompassing Extraterrestrials and Advanced Intelligences by  
reflecting on the following: Could all or most of the beings coming to 
Earth be working as a single force in the creation of a new ET Human 
Hybrid race – within which they are preserving themselves as well as the
 current lineage of Humans? Could we be witnessing the creation of a 
totally new species that will have even more variations than humanity 
presently has today?</p>
