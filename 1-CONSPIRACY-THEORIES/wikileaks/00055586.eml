THE BIG IDEA:
&#8212;=C2=A0Because of ISIS and the threat of attacks on the homeland, Syr=
ia has been on the front burner and Afghanistan has been on the back burner=
 during the presidential campaign. That=E2=80=99s about to change.
In the last few hours, a Taliban suicide bomber killed at least one person =
and injured 13 more near the airport in Kabul. The incident, just two weeks=
 after a major assault on the city and a week after six U.S. soldiers were =
killed in another bombing near Bagram air base, underscores the extent to w=
hich the situation continues to deteriorate.
&#8212; =E2=80=9CIn private, top Afghan and American officials have begun t=
o voice increasingly grim assessments of the resurgent Taliban threat,=E2=
=80=9D The Post=E2=80=99s Sudarsan Raghavan reports from Marja. &#8220;With=
 control of =E2=80=94 or a significant presence in =E2=80=94 roughly 30 per=
cent of districts across the nation, according to Western and Afghan offici=
als, the Taliban now holds more territory than in any year since 2001. =E2=
=80=A6 Deserters and injured Afghan soldiers say they are fighting a more s=
ophisticated and well-armed insurgency than they have seen in years.&#8221;
&#8212; The Post=C2=A0obtained an eye-opening transcript of a late-October =
meeting of the Afghan National Security Council that raises serious questio=
ns about whether the local government is up for the challenge.=C2=A0=E2=80=
=9CWe have not met the people=E2=80=99s expectations. We haven=E2=80=99t de=
livered,=E2=80=9D Abdullah Abdullah, the country=E2=80=99s chief executive,=
 told the high-level gathering. =E2=80=9COur forces lack discipline. They l=
ack rotation opportunities. We haven=E2=80=99t taken care of our own police=
men and soldiers. They continue to absorb enormous casualties.=E2=80=9D=C2=
=A0At the=C2=A0meeting, Gen. John F. Campbell, the commander of U.S. and al=
lied forces in Afghanistan, told his Afghan counterparts that he was as gui=
lty as they were of =E2=80=9Cjust putting our finger in the dike in Helmand=
.=E2=80=9D
&#8212; &#8220;For now, the top American and Afghan priority is preventing =
Helmand, largely secured by U.S. Marines and British forces in 2012, from a=
gain falling to the insurgency,&#8221; Raghavan reports. &#8220;As of last =
month, about 7,000 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed th=
is year, with 12,000 injured, a 26 percent increase over the total number o=
f dead and wounded in all of 2014. &#8230;U.S. Special Operations troops ar=
e increasingly being deployed into harm=E2=80=99s way to assist their Afgha=
n counterparts. Since Nov.=C2=A04, four members of the U.S.-led coalition h=
ave been wounded in Helmand.&#8221; Read the full story.

&nbsp;
&#8212;=C2=A0Afghanistan=E2=80=99s decline has serious implications for U.S=
. national security. One of President Obama=E2=80=99s first major decisions=
 was to expand the troop presence in the country. This is a major legacy is=
sue for him. How far are the 2016 candidates in both parties willing to go =
to stop the Taliban? The electorate remains reluctant about open-ended depl=
oyments of U.S. boots on the ground. How much more sacrifice Americans are =
willing to accept, even in this time of rising anxiety about terrorism, is =
very much an open question.

orts from Kabul today=C2=A0on=C2=A0the beheading of a third-grade girl.
&#8212; &#8230;but can there be a negotiated peace? From the Associated Pre=
ss: &#8220;Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed on Sunday to meet with U.S. and =
Chinese officials in the first weeks of the new year to discuss &#8216;peac=
e-related issues,&#8217; a move that could re-invigorate a stalled peace pr=
ocess with the Taliban, the Afghan president=E2=80=99s office said.=C2=A0Th=
e development came as Pakistan=E2=80=99s powerful army chief Gen. Raheel Sh=
arif met with senior officials in the Afghan capital.&#8221;

hat Taylor, who had received diagnoses of learning and emotional disabiliti=

broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelligence has become a=
 part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will drive cars. Compute=
r algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advertisements to show u=
s. Machines create news stories without human intervention. Machines can re=
cognize your face in a crowd. &#8230; We don=E2=80=99t know how this will p=
lay out. But some of the most serious thinkers on Earth worry about potenti=
al hazards =E2=80=94 and wonder whether we remain fully in control of our i=
nventions.=E2=80=9D

&#8212; Los Angeles Times, &#8220;Trump left his mark on Atlantic City =E2=
=80=94 for better and for worse,&#8221; by Joseph Tanfani:=C2=A0&#8220;With=
 his showman&#8217;s knack for positive spin, he depicts his history in Atl=
antic City, bankruptcies and all, as more proof of his genius for timing. &=
#8230;=C2=A0The real story of Trump&#8217;s rise and fall in Atlantic City =
is more complicated. His casinos were profitable early. As he expanded, tho=
ugh, Trump&#8217;s aggressive borrowing and go-go strategy left them labori=
ng under high-interest debt. When he decided to leave, in 2009, the exit wa=
s far from smooth and graceful; he gave up after last-ditch battles with bo=
ndholders.=C2=A0Today, some still love him here, even people who lost money=
. Others have bitter memories. &#8216;He trampled everyone: the shareholder=
s, the bondholders, the employees, the contractors,&#8217; said Sebastian P=
ignatello, who lives in Flushing, N.Y., near where Trump grew up. An invest=
or who headed a stockholders&#8217; committee that tried to recover losses =
in one Trump bankruptcy, Pignatello says many small businesses had to settl=

221; by Dan Tuohy: &#8220;Talking about &#8216;ground game&#8217; ahead of =
New Hampshire&#8217;s first-in-the-nation Presidential Primary, it seemed a=
ppropriate to hear Tom Rath refer to &#8216;Sabermetrics,&#8217; =C2=A0the =
statistical study of baseball to identify player performance. &#8216;It&#82=
17;s become more like the analytics approach to baseball,&#8217; he said. &=
#8216;Analytics really drives a lot of the tactical decisions.&#8217;=C2=A0=
His player is John Kasich, the Ohio governor. Rath, a state co-chairman, sh=
ared some insight into the Republican presidential hopeful&#8217;s organiza=
tion and the use of data-mining technology to target likely voters. &#8230;=
 The technology indicates where a campaign is strongest and drills down to =
the demographics, said John E. Sununu, a former U.S. senator who is Kasich&=
#8217;s state chairman. He said the data provides a more objective layer, b=
ut experience and expertise remain key to the roadmap.&#8221;

=80=9D By David Axe: =E2=80=9CElon Musk has called reusability =E2=80=98the=
 fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space.=E2=80=99=
 For decades, government and private space organizations have dreamed of po=
ssessing such a multiple-use rocket, believing it will cut down on the high=
 cost=E2=80=94hundreds of millions of dollars per launch=E2=80=94of getting=
 to, and beyond, Earth=E2=80=99s orbit. Governments have repeatedly tried a=
nd failed to design a launch-and-land rocket. It took a private company hea=
ded by an eccentric billionaire inventor to actually get it done following =
years of experimentation and one high-profile crash in April. Musk and Spac=
eX=E2=80=99s December feat was more than just a technological milestone=E2=
=80=94it also signaled the coming of age of private space exploration. If 2=
015 was the year private space firms such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, Virgin Ga=
lactic and lunar mining concern Moon Express blasted into the headlines, 20=
16 could be the year these extraterrestrial companies make substantial prog=
ress toward reaching, exploring and profiting from space.=E2=80=9D

oversial companies linked to human rights abuses across the country.&#8221;
HOT ON THE RIGHT

enghazi hearings a &#8220;disaster.&#8221; From the Washington Examiner: &#=
8220;He=C2=A0did not win with those hearings,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;It =

QUOTE OF THE DAY:
This summer Bernie Sanders got angry when=C2=A0interviewers suggested he an=
d Trump were both outsiders tapping into discontent with the status quo. No=
w, a month out from Iowa, he=E2=80=99s changing his tune. =E2=80=9CMany of =
Trump&#8217;s supporters are working class people and they&#8217;re angry,=
=E2=80=9D the democratic socialist said on CBS Sunday. =E2=80=9CAnd they&#8=
217;re angry because they&#8217;re working longer hours for lower wages. Th=
ey&#8217;re angry because their jobs have left this country and gone to Chi=
na or other low wage countries. They&#8217;re angry because they can&#8217;=
t afford to send their kids to college or they can&#8217;t retire with dign=
ity. And I think what Trump has done successfully, I would say, is take tha=
t anger, take that anxiety about terrorism and say to a lot of people in th=
is country, =E2=80=98Look, the reason for our problems is because of Mexica=
ns.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=A6 For his working class and middle class supporters, I=
 think we can make the case that if we really want to address the issues th=
at people are concerned about &#8230; we need policies that bring us togeth=
er, that take on the greed of Wall Street, the greed of corporate America a=
nd create a middle class that works for all of us, rather than an economy t=
hat works just for a few.=E2=80=9D

ong>In all, according to Terrence Taylor=E2=80=99s bank records and court d=
ocuments, the burn survivor sold $11 million of his structured settlement =
=E2=80=94 which had a present value of about $8.5 million =E2=80=94 for rou=
ghly $1.4 million, or 16 cents on the present dollar. He has sued the compa=
nies, focusing on a South Florida firm named Structured Asset Funding, whic=
h did six deals with him. That Taylor, who had received diagnoses of learni=
ng and emotional disabilities, could so quickly hemorrhage 30 years=E2=80=
=99 worth of income in deals approved in a courthouse he never visited is t=
he result of Virginia=E2=80=99s failure to properly regulate and monitor an=
 industry that makes tens of millions off some of the state=E2=80=99s most =
vulnerable residents, a Washington Post investigation has found. Unlike tra=
ditional settlements, which are paid out in one sum, structured settlements=
 dispense the payout in portions over a lifetime to protect vulnerable peop=
le from immediately spending it all.=E2=80=9D</p>

=80=9C</strong>Nick Bostrom=E2=80=99s underlying concerns about machine int=
elligence, unintended consequences and potentially malevolent computers hav=
e gone mainstream. You can=E2=80=99t attend a technology conference these d=
ays without someone bringing up the A.I. anxiety. It hovers over the tech c=
onversation with the high-pitched whine of a 1950s-era Hollywood flying sau=

d Bill Gates. And that Elon Musk gave $10 million for research on how to ke=
ep machine intelligence under control. All that is true. =E2=80=A6 This is =
a topic rife with speculation and perhaps a whiff of hysteria. But the disc=
ussion reflects a broader truth: We live in an age in which machine intelli=
gence has become a part of daily life. Computers fly planes and soon will d=
rive cars. Computer algorithms anticipate our needs and decide which advert=
isements to show us. Machines create news stories without human interventio=

umid summer day in 1972, Hillary Rodham walked into this town=E2=80=99s new=
 private academy, a couple of cinder-block classrooms erected hurriedly ami=
d fields of farmland, and pretended to be someone else.=C2=A0Playing down h=
er flat Chicago accent, she told the school=E2=80=99s guidance counselor th=
at her husband had just taken a job in Dothan, that they were a churchgoing=
 family and that they were looking for a school for their son.=C2=A0The fut=
ure Mrs. Clinton, then a 24-year-old law student, was working for Marian Wr=
ight Edelman, the civil rights activist and prominent advocate for children=
. Mrs. Edelman had sent her to Alabama to help prove that the Nixon adminis=
tration was not enforcing the legal ban on granting tax-exempt status to so=
-called segregation academies, the estimated 200 private academies that spr=
ang up in the South to cater to white families after a 1969 Supreme Court d=
ecision forced public schools to integrate.=C2=A0Her mission was simple: Es=
tablish whether the Dothan school was discriminating based on race. &#8230;=
 =C2=A0A look at Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s efforts that summer, through archiv=
es and interviews with more than 50 local officials, civil rights activists=
 and people who knew her, reveals a summer job that was both out of charact=
er for the bookish law student and a moment of awakening.&#8221;</p>

=C2=A0</span>The real story of Trump&#8217;s rise and fall in Atlantic City=
 is more complicated. His casinos were profitable early. As he expanded, th=
ough, Trump&#8217;s aggressive borrowing and go-go strategy left them labor=
ing under high-interest debt. When he decided to leave, in 2009, the exit w=
as far from smooth and graceful; he gave up after last-ditch battles with b=
ondholders.=C2=A0Today, some still love him here, even people who lost mone=
y. Others have bitter memories. &#8216;He trampled everyone: the shareholde=
rs, the bondholders, the employees, the contractors,&#8217; said Sebastian =
Pignatello, who lives in Flushing, N.Y., near where Trump grew up. An inves=

ause they can&#8217;t afford to send their kids to college or they can&#821=
7;t retire with dignity. And I think what Trump has done successfully, I wo=
uld say, is take that anger, take that anxiety about terrorism and say to a=
 lot of people in this country, =E2=80=98Look, the reason for our problems =
is because of Mexicans.=E2=80=99 =E2=80=A6 For his working class and middle=
 class supporters, I think we can make the case that if we really want to a=
ddress the issues that people are concerned about &#8230; we need policies =
that bring us together, that take on the greed of Wall Street, the greed of=
 corporate America and create a middle class that works for all of us, rath=
