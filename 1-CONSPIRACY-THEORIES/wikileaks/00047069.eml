Subject: Extraterrestrial Disclosure Meeting: Week of August 11

Dear John:

I am available and would like to schedule a meeting with you the week of
August 11 to discuss Extraterrestrial Disclosure. I live in the Washington
DC area. Dr. Mitchell will not be with us, unfortunately.

As our earlier emails discussed, we are moving into a new phase of public
awareness of the extraterrestrial presence. The UFO craft investigation
phase seems to be concluding, as our own technology advances.

The next phase is one of consciousness. I call it Exoconsciousness. I
believe it will be the most significant phase of Disclosure. This phase
integrates consciousness, the ET presence, energy systems such as zero
point and eventually will achieve the science-technology for creation of
consciousness craft.

John, as you lead our country in the fields of energy and climate change,
our country is also leading the way in securing our planet from destruction
by asteroids and debris. This is significant because we humans are here to
preserve our planet as a seeding ground for life in the cosmos.

While many discuss the deterioration of climate on the Earth, which is
true, we also need to focus on our achievements.  For the first time,
possibly in planetary history, we are able to protect our planet from
cosmic destruction which has happened numerous times. Each time we
experience a cosmic hit, our planet and our species goes through a lengthy
rebuilding phase. We are now entering a time when we are able to protect
our own planet--aware of its significance and our major role in sustaining
it.

As we humans become planet preservationists within a cosmos of other
beings--we achieve Exoconsciousness. We are aware we are not alone. Now or
Ever.

I look forward to meeting with you, John.

All the best,
Rebecca
