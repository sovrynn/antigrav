<h2><span id="The_fireworks_finale_of_modern_end-time_warnings">The fireworks finale of modern, end-time warnings</span></h2>
<hr><p class="first-paragraph">By modern, I mean nothing discussed in this section predates the release of <em>The Black Hole</em>
 on December 21, 1979. I don’t talk about biblical prophets or the Maya 
Long Count. I’m talking about the here and now. This section is my <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>definitive list of end-time warnings </em></strong></span><em>beginning with the December 21, 1979 release of The Black Hole</em>. This was not an arbitrary date.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="impact-90">The Ћinkers began their “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings in 1979 because it was 43 years before 2022. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Everything points to 2022 as the year of the apocalypse.</span></div>
<p>Conspicuously absent is the destruction of the World Trade Center on 
September 11, 2001. You can read about that on this homepage and page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/dust/">№ 7. The real horror of September 11, 2001 (9/11) is the truth</a>.
 But do not for a moment think what happened on that fateful day is any 
different than the Georgia Guidestones, the “Apocalyptic Pillar” at the 
Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, or the <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em>
 movies. All three of these at least in part are intended to inform us 
that the bankers,—the people who control the end-time infrastructure in 
and around Denver, Colorado—are responsible for what happened on 
September 11, 2001. In other words, three of the five end-time warnings 
from the Ћinkers are at least in part telling us what really happened 
that day. Why is this so important to them? What does it say about 9/11?</p>

 You must divorce yourself from popular thinking about what happened on 
that day, be it the official version of events or one of an endless 
variety of “conspiracy theories” about what really happened on 9/11. And
 you must stop playing the blame game. Who did it is painfully obvious 
once you learn how to read the numeric symbolism, but that is not the 
point. <em>Listen to me, please.</em> You must think of 9/11 
dispassionately in order to grasp what the Ћinkers are trying to tell 
us. And that can be summarized by saying <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>men do not do things of such magnitude unless they know the world in which we live is about to be destroyed</em></strong></span>.
 It is the timing of 9/11 that should concern you more than anything 
else. We are living in the end time. It’s really happening. That is the 
message of 9/11 and that is why three of the five end-time warnings from
 the Ћinkers point to the bankers as the ones responsible for 9/11. It’s
 not to blame them. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is for us to comprehend the enormity of what is happening. </em></strong></span>Why else do you think 9/11 dominates the homepage of <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>? When I first started writing, 9/11 was just one of the pages in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/sitemap/#h-our-entirely-fabricated-reality"><em>Our Entirely Fabricated Reality</em></a>
 menu intended to challenge the reader to accept alternative 
explanations for major historical events, nothing more. Now it is more 
important to me than what happened in Elizabethan England. In other 
words, <em>I too had to learn the profound significance of what happened on September 11, 2001</em>. And I learned it from the Freemasons of the South over a period of years.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">The list</div>
<p>This list is in more or less chronological order. In the following 
condensed list, there are only five end-time warnings. It is my strongly
 held belief that all five of these are the work of the Freemasons of 
the South. These are the people I refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>. The 
first two are made of stone to honor the papal architects who built the 
Gothic cathedrals in Europe while keeping a close eye on the Roman 
Catholic Church. The last three are all movies. Of these six movies, the
 most well-hidden from public scrutiny was <em>Virus</em> (1980). It 
carries the message the new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, 
China, in December 2019 (COVID-19) is an integral part of the end game. <em>Virus</em> (1980) is part of a trilogy of interconnected movies that are the backbone of this homepage.&nbsp;</p>

</ul><p>This may not seem like an impressive list to you, but each of 
these warnings has a huge story behind it. The level of planning here is
 intense. What I believe to be probably only a handful of Freemason 
families in the South—who were isolated and cut off from the progeny of 
Jove by the Civil War <em>but retained specific information about the end time—</em>are on a mission <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>very much in the here and now</em></strong></span>
 to awaken you from your uniformitarian dream of life (in which 
planetary catastrophes only happen in movies). They got their marching 
orders from the Bard. This is a veritable fireworks finale of end-times 
warnings from the Ћinkers. I begin the list here and then continue it in

<p>This last entry is non-trivial. Alder Av Grunn is one of my most important intellectual contributors. He is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.triplenine.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Triple Nines Society</a>
 guy. He runs computer algorithms against the King James Bible. I assume
 in doing so that he is using well-known encryption algorithms used by 
Sir Francis Bacon and his circle of friends. Whatever he has found has 
him frightened. He will not tell me because he knows whatever he tells 
me will be published. In our last email exchange, I asked him a very 
specific question about a number that is known to be of paramount 
importance to the progeny of Jove. His email response began, “Not yet. 
Time is not right.” He went on to say he would have to divulge more than
 he is willing to share at this time. I trust this guy. I know his real 
name and have confirmed his status in society. So I know the original 
1611 King James Bible encodes information way beyond the 222 occurrences
 of the word “wisdom” that I discuss in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/rebis/#There_are_22_chapters_in_The_Revelation_and_222_occurrences_of_wisdom_in_the_KJV_of_the_Bible"><em>There are 22 chapters in The Revelation and 222 occurrences of “wisdom” in the KJV of the Bible</em></a>.
 But the year of publication somewhat confounds me.&nbsp;It is obvious 
why the King James Version of the Bible was commissioned in 1604, but I 
can never be sure why it was published in 2011. According to no less 
than Manly P. Hall,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first edition of the King James Bible, which was edited by 
Francis Bacon and prepared under Masonic supervision, bears more Mason’s
 marks than the Cathedral of Strasburg.</p>
<p class="citation">Manly P. Hall, <em>Rosicrucian and Masonic Origins</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Sir Francis Bacon was not fully cognizant of the exact date or 
year of the coming Earth crustal displacement, then none of the Ћinkers 
have ever known. That is simply not possible. <em>They knew.</em> But the meaning behind the 11 in 1611 or what they must have been keenly aware of—the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of its publication in 2011—escapes me.</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">The 1617 edition</div>
<p>I don’t want to bore the reader with too many details about the KJV 
of the Bible, but there were “He” and “She” editions. The former had a 
number of errors that were corrected in the latter. The “She” edition 
was printed from 1611 to 1613. <em>And perhaps even more importantly there is a 1617 edition.</em> The latter is as rare as the original “He” edition printed in 1611. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.thekjvstore.com/1617-king-james-bible-original-bible-leaves/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The KJV Store</a>,
 “The 1617 edition is nearly identical to the 1611 edition, with 
differences only in some word spacing, spelling, and woodcuts — only an 
expert can distinguish the two editions! <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The leaves of the 1611 and 1617 editions were designed to be fully interchangeable.</em></strong></span>
 Census of current copies: 1611 “He” edition, 175 copies; 1611 “She” 
edition, 450 copies; 1617 edition, 225 copies” (emphasis added). Knowing
 what I do of the Ћinkers, here is my take on what is happening. We know
 how meticulously the First Folio was printed. There are no mistakes in 
it except those Sir Francis Bacon intended. <em>To have an actual, real mistake in the First Folio would have been disastrous.</em>
 There were 900 pages in the First Folio because as anyone who reads me 
knows, the number 9 and multiples thereof always signify command and 
control. However, there were 1536 pages in the 1611 KJV of the Bible. 
The reason for this page count is known by only a handful of people. It 
is a reference to the year that <em>Prognostictio Eximii Doctoris Theophrasti Paracelsi</em> or <em>The Prophecies of Paracelsus</em>
 was published,—the book that inspired Sir Francis Bacon and his circle 
of friends in Elizabethan England to found the original Roscicrucains 
and by extension the Freemasons. But the First Folio was printed in 
1623, twelve years after the King James Bible. <em>In other words, these men did not have the benefit of the experience of printing such a huge book in 1611.</em>
 I emphasized “The leaves of the 1611 and 1617 editions were designed to
 be fully interchangeable” in the above quote because I think it is the 
1617 edition for which the year of publication is meant to be of great 
significance. It would have been error-free by then. And of course, this
 would make the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">September 23, 2017</a> date of the asterism alluded to in <em>The Revelation</em>
 the 400th anniversary of the publication of an (error-free) King James 
Version of the Bible. And in a world where deliberate errors are a means
 of communication, being free of actual, real printing errors is 
critically important.</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">The GMT Correlation problem</div>
<p>I don’t think the year of publication is related to the Maya Long 
Count at all. Even if it were, there is the rather significant problem 
that Thompson did not propose the GMT (Goodman Martinez Thompson) 
Correlation until 1937. So the appearance of the KJV publication date 
being somehow related to the Maya Long Count is deceptive.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="impact-2x-red" style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem auto;">Why is <em>Tomorrowland</em> all about<br>the 1964 New York World’s Fair?</div>
<p>In a 1961 “progress report” video produced by the New York World’s 
Fair 1964-1965 Corporation, Mayor Robert F. Wagner said, “this coincides
 with the 300<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the great city
 of New York.” That is a highly questionable interpretation of history. 
As discussed in a New York Times article entitled <em>“New York’s Birth Date: Don’t Go by City’s Seal,”</em>
 1664 was “the year that Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam to 
the British, who renamed it New York.” But the city was founded long 
before that.&nbsp;Ostensibly, another reason 1664 was chosen was that it
 was the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_World%27s_Fair" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1939 New York World’s Fair</a>
 at the same location. So these are the two reasons proffered for 
choosing the year 1964. Both are a stretch in my opinion. Something else
 was going on. And that something else was the initial planning for the 
World Trade Center first announced way back in 1943. As discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/#David_Rockefeller_announces_plans_for_the_World_Trade_Center_in_1943"><em>David Rockefeller announces plans for the World Trade Center in 1943</em></a>
 on my homepage, the Ћinkers knew the significance of the year 1943 to 
the bankers. So they knew something was afoot. Now listen carefully to 
what I am about to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was a real World’s Fair. 1964 was something else entirely. It was not even sanctioned by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world%27s_fairs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bureau International des Exposition (BIE)</a>. Why? <em>This is an important question to answer.</em> Ironically, the answer is directly related to the name of the Wikipedia article from which the following quote is excerpted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the mid-1930s, Moses oversaw the conversion of a vast Queens tidal
 marsh garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939-1940 
World’s Fair. Called Flushing Meadows Park, it was Moses’ grandest park 
scheme. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">He envisioned this vast park, comprising some <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>1</strong></span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3</strong></span>00 acres (<em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>5</strong></span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>3</strong></span></em> km<sup>2</sup>) of land, easily accessible from Manhattan, as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers.</span>
 When the 1939-1940 World’s Fair ended in financial failure, Moses did 
not have the available funds to complete work on his project. He saw the
 1964-1965 Fair as a means to finish what the earlier fair had begun.</p>
<p>To ensure profits to complete the park, fair organizers knew they 
would have to maximize receipts. An estimated attendance of 70 million 
people would be needed to turn a profit and, for attendance that large, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the fair would need to be held for two years</em></strong></span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>World’s Fair Corporation</em></strong></span>
 also decided to charge site-rental fees to all exhibitors who wished to
 construct pavilions on the grounds. This decision caused the fair to 
come into conflict with the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), 
as the international body headquartered in Paris that sanctions world’s 
fairs: <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>BIE rules stated that an international exposition could run for one six-month period only</em></strong></span>,
 and no rent could be charged to exhibitors. In addition, the rules 
allowed only one exposition in any given country within a 10-year 
period, and the Seattle World’s Fair had already been sanctioned for 
1962, as 2 years prior.</p>
<p>The United States was not a member of the BIE at the time, but fair 
organizers understood that approval by the BIE would ensure that its 
nearly 40 member nations would participate in the fair. Moses, undaunted
 by the rules, journeyed to Paris to seek official approval for the New 
York fair. When the BIE balked at New York’s bid, Moses, used to having 
his way in New York, angered the BIE delegates by taking his case to the
 press, publicly stating his disdain for the BIE and its rules. The BIE 
retaliated by formally requesting its member nations not to participate 
in the New York fair. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The 
1964-1965 New York World’s Fair is the only significant world’s fair 
since the formation of the BIE to be held without its endorsement.</em></strong></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;">The answer to the question posed above is 1965. 1965 is what the New York World’s Fair was all about.</p>
<p class="very-large-print" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">1965 + <strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">58</span></em></strong> = 2023</p>
<p>I grow weary of denying my place in this world. You can search to 
your heart’s content and you will not find anyone else on the planet who
 understands the meaning of the “58 days” in <em>Tomorrowland</em>. I 
tried for a month to privatize the core of my work so as to not bring 
unwanted attention to the Freemasons in Atlanta, Georgia. <em>I could not.</em> Every attempt I made to implement the very same software that runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The 216 Club</em></a>
 resulted in me being locked out of my own website until I felt as if I 
were beating my head against a wall. I don’t know who or what was behind
 that. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Whether it be divine or human intervention, I cannot say.</em></strong></span> But to the men who built the Georgia Guidestones, who I would follow into combat,—<em>yea through the gates of hell</em>,—I say this; I trust in your character not to harm me. I did not take the Vow of Silence. <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am not one of you.</span></strong></em> <em>Metaphysics is all I have in this world.</em>
 I pray every day to the one Mind to show me everything. Yet if I am 
wrong about you,—if you find yourself discussing the necessity of 
terminating either me or this website,—know this. I do not know who 
fathered me. I never will. But I do know this. I was born on May 8, 
1958.</p>

<p>You see, Marty McFly and I have something in common. And I also know 
1844, the year Pythagoras Lodge No. 41 was founded, has something to do 
with Mary Baker Eddy. I am a student of hers, though <em>I feel nothing but disdain for organized religion</em>. Can you not see, as even I must at moments like this, that I was fated to do this work, <em>that this is my destiny</em>.
 When I look back over my shoulder at the people who have genuinely 
tried to harm me in this life, I fear God. There are things worse than 
death. Stay out of my way. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>I mean you no harm.</em> </span></strong>Indeed, I have reached out to you for help more than once. This will be my last appeal to you. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>If there is anything you can do to help, the people deserve to know the truth.</em> </span></strong>My
 donors are a special group of people. They really do hear the ancients 
screaming at us. And they are a tiny fraction of the public. We present 
no threat to anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="intro">9/11 used to emphasize the truth of 58 days</div>
<p class="first-paragraph">I’ll tell you something else I learned while studying this scene. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Its’s duration is 156 seconds.</em></strong></span> As discussed in the section entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/#Why_September_11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why September 11?</a> on my homepage, 911 is the 156<sup>th</sup> prime. Now watch—no, this is not the right word—<em>study</em>, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>study as if your life depended on it</em></strong></span>,
 the final seconds of this scene. Those are not two legs falling. They 
are the Twin Towers falling, exactly as you see them falling in <em>Back to the Future</em>. The <span class="s1">Ћ</span>inkers are using 9/11 to tell you that this is the most important scene in the movie and that what they are telling you is <em>the raw, unadulterated truth</em>. Most of you reading this will be dead two years from now. I’ve been aware for some time now that the <span class="s1">Ћ</span>inkers
 were making constant references to 9/11, but this is the first time 
I’ve ever realized that reminding us that they are the one’s who told us
 the truth about what happened is a way of placing emphasis on whatever 
they are saying, in this case, that the world is going to end in the 
winter of 2023-2024, within a month or so of the winter solstice. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Did you catch that part</em></strong></span> when Franks says, <em>“It could be a month. It could be sooner”</em>? Here let me show it to you again.&nbsp;</p>

 In this case, a simple arithmetic expression. You can read Manly P.

mindlessness of people like Madame Blavatsky and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.theosophical.org/component/content/article/25-online-resources/online-leaflets/1796-hp-blavatsky-and-her-writings" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Theosophical Society</a>.

 Ћinkers count on such intellectual pretension to hide the simplicity of
 their numeric symbolism which has two main elements: references to 
their origins in Elizabethan England and profoundly simple mathematical 
expressions such as the one above.</em></strong></span> In this case, 
the 58 is a reference to the year 1558, when Queen Elizabeth I ascended 
to the throne. If you don’t know that she was Sir Francis Bacon’s 
mother, that Sir Francis Bacon was William Shakespeare (<em>the playwright, not the actor</em>)
 and that he started the original Rosicrucians and by extension the 
Freemasons, or that that these men have had a huge impact on modern 
life, including the founding of The United States of America, and that 
they are fiercely loyal to their leader, etc., etc., etc., then you need
 to read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>. Don’t let that freak you out. <em>No one is asking you to read Shakespeare’s plays.</em>
 I have not. Yet after only a couple of years pursuing this knowledge, I
 can tell you more about the reality of those plays than most English 
professors at Ivy League schools.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em;">You just need to know something about the people I call the <em>Ћinkers</em>.
 Otherwise, if I tell you they built the Georgia Guidestones because 
they have specific knowledge from a previous world age that there is 
going to be an Earth crustal displacement in the winter of 2023-2024, <em>what does it matter?</em> They have no credibility with you. The meaning of 58 is discussed throughout this website, but primarily in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/#The_Number_58_Why_2001"><em>The Number 58: Why 2001?</em></a> on the homepage. Another rule of thumb to keep in mind is that the more important the use of what I call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/signatures/"><em>numeric signatures</em></a>,
 the more likely it is to include the numbers 53 (Sir Francis Bacon) or 
58 (his mother, Queen Elizabeth I), things close to the heart of the men
 who <em>to this very day</em> carry out the orders of the Bard.</p>
<p>I do not know from personal experience, but I imagine advancing 
through the ranks of the Freemasons of the South, particularly the Royal
 Arch Freemasons of yore, is not what most people imagine. Which is to 
say, it is not an exercise of becoming <em>enmeshed in esotericism</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>To
 the contrary, it is undoubtedly an exercise in learning about the 
simplicity of these numeric symbols and how they represent a glorious 
past dating back to one of the finest men to ever trod the globe since 
the Nazarene.</em></strong></span> You can do the same on this website. I maintain an ever-growing dictionary of numeric symbols on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>The 216 Club</em></a>. The numbers I understand for sure are published on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>. For example, 115 (number), 1:15 (time), or November 5 (date). All three of these numeric symbols reference the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/fireworks-finale/#115_115_and_November_5_are_always_references_to_the_Gunpowder_Plot_and_are_the_Cinker_equivalent_of_322"><em>Gunpowder Plot</em></a>, usually by way of pointing to the real 9/11 culprits. That is how simple is this language of numeric symbols. <em>It is not complicated.</em>
 It does not require a knowledge of advanced mathematics or a lifetime 
of reading obscure, intentionally obfuscated, and essentially 
meaningless texts.</p>

<p>So the “<em>1964</em> New York World’s Fair” is actually all about the year <em>1965</em>.
 The somewhat hidden 1965 is part of a mathematical expression that 
reveals the year of the apocalypse as does 1980, the year the Georgia 
Guidestones were unveiled, when 43 is added to it. These are the two 
great end-time mathematical expressions of the Ћinkers. <em>Can you see the difference?</em>
 The number that is sacred to the Ћinkers is being added to something 
that brought joy and laughter to the world. The number that is sacred to
 the bankers is being added to something, which once understood, is a 
grizzly reminder of the Civil War bloodbath when the Old World bankers 
used immigrants fresh off the ships from Europe to seize control of The 
United States of America. Sound too fantastical to be true? Wait until 
you learn that Abraham Lincoln was a Rosicrucian and Southern 
sympathizer, or that the Gettysburg Address was an encoded message of 
support intended for the Freemasons in the South. <em>Nothing is what it seems.&nbsp;</em></p>

Fair. Thoughts of an economic boon to the city as the result of 
increased tourism was a major reason for holding another fair 25 years 
after the 1939/1940 extravaganza.</p>

<p>Kubrick’s decision to avoid the fanciful portrayals of space found in
 standard popular science fiction films of the time led him to seek more
 realistic and accurate depictions of space travel. Illustrators such as

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">On a website that has been likened to Mel Gibson in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_Theory_(film)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Conspiracy Theory</em></a>, this section is something even I was reluctant to write about. <em>The Virus</em> (1980) movie was the second end-time warning movie ever made after <em>The Black Hole</em>.
 It was released the same year as the Georgia Guidestones were unveiled 
for a reason. You may think this movie has something to do with COVID-19
 and it does, but the real message of this movie is that there is going 
to be a nuclear holocaust in the closing moments of the Fifth World. 
This really is so far beyond what the average reader can internalize, 
that I might as well piss in the wind then to expect anyone to 
acknowledge what I am saying. I saw this first in all of the nuclear 
bomb explosion imagery in the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie, but refused 
to accept it myself. Even after discovering Virus (1980) and becoming 
convinced that it was profoundly important, I waited for weeks before I 
would let myself put pen to paper. But in the end, I have no choice. It 
is there. It is not me. First, I will discuss what the movie is really 
all about. Then I will explain my reasons for believing that this movie 
was made by the Ћinkers and is in fact one of the most important 
end-time warning movies ever made.</p>

Russia and I would imagine China will not be excluded in the nuclea r

 see the message right away in “the tremendous weight of the sea

unleashed by an Earth crustal displacement as a full-scale nuclear 
attack. Thus the closing moments of the Fifth World will be a nuclear 
holocaust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why was this movie made in Japan? For two reasons. The first is that 
the bankers used a Japanese-American architect to design the World Trade
 Center. His name was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoru_Yamasaki" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Minoru Yamasaki</a>. The second reason is that of all the end-time movies this one was the most dangerous to make. In other words, they used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadokawa_Daiei_Studio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kadokawa Daiei Studio</a>
 in Japan to produce Virus (1980) both as an allegory for what the 
bankers did in designing the World Trade Center and for the 
secrecy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro" style="color: #333333;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Made in Japan</span> scene</div>
<p>Here is a scene from <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> that 
directly references Virus (1980) and in so doing makes the same point I

<p>SOURCE MATERIAL (i.e. NOTES)….</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 36px; margin-bottom: 0;">This movie is part of a closely interconnected trilogy of movies. The other two, <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em>
 are discussed in the previous section. Heretofore, the fact that Virus 
(1980) is part of this trilogy was unknown. I did not discover the 
connection until May 21, 2021. So if you are reading this, you are one 
of the first people to know that COVID-19 was <em>as planned as was the destruction of the World Trade Center</em>. It was a sobering, grim realization for me. We are headed into unknown territory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This is the second movie after <em>The Black Hole</em>. It has a 
108-minute runtime as does the Back to the Future Part II. This and the 
MM virus names forms a strong link to the hidden 108 miles in the 
Georgia Guidestones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glenn Ford plays “Richardson” (i.e. son of a rich person)</p>
<p>Amazon lists May 10, 1980, as the release date for the 108-minute version.</p>
<ul><li>Runtime is 108 minutes. This is a military-engineered virus. The
 virus name is MM-88, which is curious because this is the same year the
 Georgia Guidestones were erected. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_(1980_film)" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>&nbsp;notes, “At the time of its release, the film was the most expensive&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_film" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Japanese film</a>&nbsp;ever made.”</li>
</ul><p>Wikipedia (“It’s not too late” American song ending):</p>
<p>Washington is hit by a bomb, and the screen fills with atomic bomb 
after atomic bomb exploding. From there the movie’s ending diverges 
based upon the two cuts. In the American version, the screen goes black 
for a moment, and the end credits roll over footage of the Antarctic and
 a poignant song sung by a lone woman’s voice. The refrain is, “It’s not
 too late…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extremely important IMDb carousel of images:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080768/mediaviewer/rm2146016001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080768/mediaviewer/rm2146016001/</a></p>

 This system does exist as described in the movie and is sure to be 
triggered by an Earth crustal displacement. The nuclear exchange in this
 movie gives a whole new meaning to the nuclear theme throughout 
Tomorrowland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wikipedia: (two endings)</p>
<p>Washington is hit by a bomb, and the screen fills with atomic bomb 
after atomic bomb exploding. From there the movie’s ending diverges 
based upon the two cuts. In the American version, the screen goes black 
for a moment, and the end credits roll over footage of the Antarctic and
 a poignant song sung by a lone woman’s voice. The refrain is, “It’s not
 too late…” In the Japanese version, Yoshizumi survives the blast and 
walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching <a title="Tierra del Fuego" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tierra del Fuego</a>&nbsp;in 1988,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_(1980_film)#cite_note-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;he
 finds survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed 
vaccine. They embrace, and Yoshizumi declares “Life is wonderful.”</p>
<p>So the English version was edited so that is is 108 minutes long</p>

<p>Day or Ressurection is not a direct translation. Resurrection Day is,
 which means this choice of title is a reference to the Day or 
Ressurection in Islam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on Sakyo Komatsu’s 1964 novel is a reference to the 1964 
World’s Fair and the Tomorrowland movie. This of course means the

<p class="first-paragraph">We live in a generation in which the Electric Universe school of thought, best represented in the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/thunderbolts/">David Talbott and Wallace Thornhill</a>, is daily rewriting almost all of the sciences while being completely ignored by academia and mainstream, <em>consensus science</em>. The world of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/no/">mathematically insane</a>
 is shrinking all the time and yet they continue to strut around as if 
nothing is happening. To be sure, December 21, 2012, was the greatest 
crying wolf incidence of all time. But those who took the ball and ran 
with it in traditional books and in a plethora of YouTube videos and 
Internet websites—all claiming to have divined the meaning of the Maya 
Long Count—were not attacked as they would be in today’s <em>political correctness</em> environment. They were not told what to think. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The most massive propaganda machine in the history of mankind lay dormant.</em></strong></span> Everyone was free to think for themselves about the meaning of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/maya-long-count/">Maya Long Count</a> and <em>what the public was being told</em>
 was the end date. Rather than being dismissed as a disrespectable 
subject, serious research was done into the meaning and history of the 
Maya Long Count.</p>
<div class="impact-90">Thus did the progeny of Jove throw <span style="color: #ff0000;">the apocalypse off-switch</span> in the popular imagination with the same ease one turns off an overhead light.</div>
<p>They did nothing more than idle their thought control machine. And then,—in the aftermath of December 21, 2012,—<em>they let the peanut gallery loose on the charlatans who found an audience amongst the unsuspecting public</em>.
 It worked. Trust me. No one alive knows how well it worked better than 
me. Everything changed on the morning of December 22, 2012.&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Henceforth, such nonsense would not be tolerated by the worldly-wise.</em></strong></span> What decent, law-abiding citizen would besmirch his own reputation by entertaining the thought <em>even for a moment</em> of a planetary catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in our lifetime? <em>Rubbish!!</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What nonsense.</em></strong></span> And yet, if you knew for sure that an Earth crustal displacement was imminent and billions of people were about to die, <em>is this not exactly what you would want the public to think?</em>&nbsp; Here I am reminded of what CIA Director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/casey/">William Casey</a>
 said to Ronald Reagan: “We’ll know our disinformation program is

<p>This list of end-time warnings is <em>clear evidence</em> that the 
Ћinkers are heavily invested in the year 2013. Why? I believe the answer
 to that question is the Maya Long Count. But before I say anything 
else, let me address the idea that the Maya Long Count is a calendar. It
 is not. The Maya Long Count was designed around its end date. It is 
best thought of as a <em>countdown clock</em>. It did not end on 
December 21, 2012, and the progeny of Jove know this. That was the end 
of 13 baktuns. A baktun represents one of three interlocking gears (or 
cogs) in the conceptual mechanism of the Maya Long Count, the one that 
corresponds to years. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It actually ended on December 16, 2013, after the two smaller gears that correspond to months and days came to a stop.</em></strong></span>
 This was hidden from us because, as discussed below, December 21, 2012 
was brilliantly designed to lull everyone alseep so that the real work 
of the end time could begin in earnest the following year. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Everything is 13.</em></strong></span> Our one-dollar bill makes this perfectly clear.&nbsp;</p>

 would not have thought it possible for anything to be more 
misunderstood than the Georgia Guidestones, but the cube that appeared 
on September 11, 2009 and that was subsequently removed and 
unceremoniously destroyed five years and <em>fourteen days</em> later on September 25, 2014, is one of the most important historical events at the end of the Fifth World. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I</em></strong><strong><em>t tells the story of the Stone of Destiny, otherwise known as the Holy Grail.</em></strong></span>
 But the meaning of this cube has been divined by every Internet

 In fact, I interrupted that rewrite to rewrite my homepage. So you will
 need to wait a few more weeks or at most a month or so until I restore 
the sections on the cube. Suffice it to say for now that 2014,—the year 
that showed when the cube was installed,—was the 90<sup>th</sup> 
anniversary of the 1924 laying of the cornerstone for the Pythagoras 
Masonic Temple in Decatur, Georgia. These are the people who built the 
Georgia Guidestones. And as noted at the top of page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/georgia-guidestones/">№ 27. The grossly misunderstood Georgia Guidestones</a>, they also gave the Stone of Destiny to the bankers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2015 is the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the 
original Rosicrucians. We know this beyond any shadow of a doubt because
 the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. was completed in 1915, the 
300<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the original Rosicrucians as discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/there-can-be-only-one/#Construction_start_and_end_dates_for_the_House_of_the_Temple_in_Washington_DC"><em>Construction start and end dates for the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.</em></a>,
 only the 400th anniversary is very special. As the Israelites wandered 
in the wilderness for 40 years, 2015 marks the end of a 
multigenerational, sacred duty to warn the people about the coming Earth
 crustal displacement, one that originated with no less than <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor) whose real name was Sir Francis Bacon. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>There will be no more warnings after this year.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">The last numeric signature</div>
<p>The <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie was released <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>108</em></strong></span> days before Queen Elizabeth’s birthday. If you have read page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and the founding of the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>, then I do not need to explain to you the significance of Queen Elizabeth I’s birthday. <em>The Walk</em> was released <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>23</em></strong></span> days after September 7, 2015. <em>I know there are no more end-time warnings from the Ћinkers because of the 23 days.</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is Ћinker-talk for “It’s time for the show.”</em></strong></span> And it is a clear indication that nothing is to follow.</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">Farewell and godspeed</div>
<p><em>How can I say that?</em> I can understand a reluctance on the 
part of the reader to accept what I just said. I base this in large part
 on the profound elegance of the symbolism in <em>The Walk</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>I shall never forget watching this movie for the first time.</em></strong></span>
 What others see is a simple tale of a tightrope walker performing a 
daring feat. But what I heard was the Ћinkers saying goodbye with such 
grace and beauty that it really did reduce me to tears. At several 
points, <em>sobbing</em> would be a more descriptive word. It felt like a dream at times. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>After that, I didn’t need anybody telling me we are on our own now.</em> </strong></span>It
 wasn’t until much later that I discovered this 
“last-of-the-end-time-warnings” numerical signature, but I knew right 
away what it meant. And I will take that certainty to the grave with me.
 <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The Walk was out last end-time warning.</em></strong></span> There will be no more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The year Doc’s death is 1885 which is (2015 – 1885 =) 130 years. This
 is now the second reference to 13 in this scene. Because of the strong 
emphasis on destiny and Capricornus, whose name is called out repeatedly
 right before Doc’s grave is discovered, I would suggest to you that 
these hidden references to 13 are in fact references to the Ophiuchus 
constellation as discussed on page<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></span><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/galactic-center/">№ 29.&nbsp; Number 13, Ophiuchus, the Galactic Center, active Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic Superwaves</a></em><em>.</em>
 Look again at the still of Capricornus leaning against Doc’s 
gravestone. This is exactly how the constellation Capricornus leans 
against Aquarius. The significance of Capricornus is discussed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/progeny-of-jove/#Deliberately_provocative_astronomical_symbolism"><em>Deliberately provocative astronomical symbolism</em></a> on page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/progeny-of-jove/">№ 10. Who are the progeny of Jove?</a>.
 This whole scene is a reference to the Zodiac. Our destiny lies in the 
Aquarius and Capricornus constellations. The Babylonians called the 
Aquarius “the great one,” We are about to find out why.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">863 Survivors</div>
<p>I have learned to exercise extreme care when clipping scenes from 
these end-time warning movies because the scene runtimes also convey 
meaning. An example from below is the OUTATIME scene which I 
characterize as perhaps the most important scene in all of the end-time 
warning movies. It has a runtime of precisely 4:32, which not only is a 
sacred number but also happens to be the number of orbits of Jupiter in 
one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/great-cycles/">Maya Great Cycle</a>.&nbsp;Interestingly, this scene from <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> which depicts the final resting place of Doc has a runtime of precisely 1:50. This could be a reference to 2015. <em>But I note that there are 863 survivors in Virus (1980) and 863 is the 150<sup>th</sup> prime number.</em> Coincidence?</p>

<p>Again, I can understand how the casual reader might think so because 
he or she does not realize what is at stake here. We are talking about 
an Earth crustal displacement that is referred to as the <em>apocalypse</em> or <em>“day of the Lord”</em>
 in the Bible. It is going to erase everything and everyone you have 
ever known in one day. These end-time warning movies are the culmination
 of a 400-year effort to warn the people, one put into motion by no less
 than the man you know of as <em>William Shakespeare</em> (the playwright, not the actor). These movies are not made for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>uninitiated</em></a>. They are not made for public consumption. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Your
 inability to understand what is at stake here is what makes you 
reluctant to believe how much thought is given to some of the scenes in 
these movies.</em></strong></span> I do better than most in analyzing 
their meaning because I am a highly abstract thinker, but I am quite 
sure that even I miss tons of stuff, enough to fill a book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final entry in this timeline of end-time warnings is indirectly referenced in the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie, a fact that changed my life because for me it represented final proof that the people I call the <em>progeny of Jove</em> wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/plants/"><em>The Revelation</em></a>. I dedicate an entire page to this asterism. It is central to everything that is happening around us now. The page is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/asterism/">№ 23. The Great Wonder was an asterism on September 23, 2017 (923)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="font-size: 32px;"><li><span class="entry">September 23, 2017</span>:
 This was the date of an asterism described in Revelation 12:1-2. “And 
there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, 
and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 
and she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be 
delivered.”&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>This has been <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>the</em></strong></span> end-time marker for over two millennia now. The five-year “course correction” in <em>The Black Hole</em>
 is added to the year of this asterism in order to arrive at 2022 as the
 year of the Earth crustal displacement. Thus endeth what I like to 
characterize as a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>fireworks finally of end-time warnings</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">These two movies are part of a closely interconnected trilogy of movies. This section discusses <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em>. <em>Virus</em>
 (1980) is discussed in the next section. That is the last section on 
this homepage for a reason. I fear many of you will die of a more 
virulent strain of the coronavirus over the next year or so. You see, 
this really is not a game. It’s not a crossword puzzle. It’s not about 
blogging or Internet surfing. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is reality.</em></strong></span>
 This is the work of good men who have made very real sacrifices to warn
 you about what is happening. So I will just tell you bluntly; you need 
to come at this subject with a measure of humility. You need to stop 
listening to the herd mentality. A lot of really good people are trying 
to help you see what is really happening. We all die alone. Don’t let 
this warning be something you recall too late to make a difference. What
 more can I say to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">Five million views</div>
<p>This section owes its existence to a YouTube video that is fast 
approaching five million views. It is entitled “BACK TO THE FUTURE 
predicts 9/11” but I do not regard it as an example of what is called 
“predictive programming.” There is a very subtle difference between 
movies such as <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, which are designed to 
mold thought in such a way that it will accept a hitherto unknown 
reality such as landing on the Moon that a majority of individuals may 
otherwise question and then reject. Predictive programming is used to 
prepare the ground for something being foisted on an unsuspecting 
public. What’s happening with this trilogy of movies is something vastly
 different. <em>We are being warned.</em> We are being told who is 
responsible for 9/11 and COVID-19. Predictive programming is 
manipulative. These movies are not. It’s a question of motive. Generally
 speaking, only the bankers engage in predictive programming. <em>But that’s not the only thing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-GqOVcDG0LibYX4TjAeCg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">barelyHuman11</a> YouTube channel gets wrong.</em>
 Whoever is responsible for this video is not aware of the different 
factions within the progeny of Jove and is oblivious to what happened in
 Elizabethan England. Because of this, other important evidence is 
overlooked, some things are misunderstood, and worst of all, the third 
and arguably the most important movie in this trilogy was completely 
missed. Nonetheless, this video is extremely well done. And without it, I
 may not have ever learned about <em>The Walk</em> and most certainly would have never learned about <em>Virus</em> (1980). So let us start at what was for me the beginning.</p>

</figure><p>The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> was released July 3, 
1985. It is utterly preposterous to suggest that the producers and 
writers of this movie knew exactly what would happen on September 11, 
2001, over 16 years later. If this is what you are thinking, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>you are dead wrong</em></strong></span>.
 I will analyze this YouTube video throughout this and the next section,
 but first there is some basic information I need to communicate to the 
reader.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Philippe Petit</div>
<p>What I am about to say will upset some of you. This is a problem I encounter often, <em>a failure to appreciate the scale of what is happening</em>.
 What Philippe Petit did was astonishingly brave, but he was nonetheless
 an actor on a real-life stage. What I am telling you is that the idea 
for the movie <em>The Walk</em> was conceived of long before Philippe Petit was approached and asked to walk a tightrope between the Twin Towers. <em>If you do not allow yourself to accept this reality, you cannot appreciate what is happening with this trilogy of movies.</em>
 These are end-time warnings. Their portent is infinitely more important
 than what Philippe Petit did on August 7, 1974. In short, Philippe 
Petit was hired by the&nbsp;Ћinkers to walk a tightrope between the Twin
 Towers as part of <em>The Walk</em>. The movie is not really about him. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is allegorical.</em></strong></span> Philippe Petit is not the only one risking his life. Here I am reminded of something the Nazarene said.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="bible-verse">
<p><strong>Matthew 13:13</strong><br>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">What’s with the wire?</div>
<p>It is insanely important that you accept Philippe Petit was hired to 
walk on a tightrope between the Twin Towers and spent a significant part
 of his life preparing to do so. If he were to fail, the <em>pièce de résistance</em> of over 400 years of work,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>our final end-time warning</em></strong></span>,—and the absolute proof that the bankers are responsible for what happened on September 11, 2001, would be lost to mankind. <em>Don’t you let that happen because of your closed mind.</em>
 Understanding that Philippe Petit was an actor on a real-life stage is 
the doorway through which you enter into the world of the initiated. <em>It
 is your opportunity to leapfrog a lifetime of skullduggery to knowing 
what only a select handful of 33° Royal Arch Freemasons ever knew.</em> So I am going to replay the part of the Apophenia Productions video that discusses the “reveal” as they called it. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>It is the wire.</em></strong> <strong><em>The wire is everything.</em></strong></span>
 For Philippe Petit and most movie watchers, it stretches between the 
two Twin Towers. For the Ћinkers, it represents an equally death-defying
 exercise of disclosing who is really responsible for 9/11. For them, 
the wire stretches back in time to 1962 when they first learned from 
Robert Zemeckis that the Twin Towers would be destroyed on September 11,
 2001.&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>This is the symbolic tightrope.</em></strong></span>
 I know a little bit about walking on it, which is why I watched most of
 this movie fighting back tears and occasionally sobbing uncontrollably.
 At some very real level, the symbolism of this movie is the only 
companionship I have left in life. Knowledge of the end time will 
isolate you from those around you with the same certainty as Phillipe 
Petit walked alone on the real wire.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Robert Zemeckis</div>
<p>In the credits, <em>Back to the Future</em> is “A Robert Zemeckis Film” and he helped to write the screenplay, directed, and co-produced <em>The Walk</em>. <em>The Walk</em> purports to be based on the book <em>To Reach the Clouds</em> by Philippe Petit, originally published in 2002. <em>But this is not the truth.</em> How could it be if <em>Back to the Future</em>
 foretells the making of this movie in 1985? This movie is about 
something much larger than the life of one man. It is an allegory for 
what has been happening ever since the Ћinkers first learned that the 
World Trade Center was going to be destroyed.</p>
<div class="impact-108-red" style="text-align: center;">The Walk is allegorical</div>
<p>In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, people like me are free to 
speculate about what really happened on that fateful day, but these men 
have known the truth since 1962 and any attempt on their part to expose 
what was going to happen or who was responsible would be a death 
sentence. Robert Zemeckis is obviously one of those men, but there are 
plenty of others. I refer to them as the <em>Ћinkers</em>, but at this 
time in history, they are primarily a highly select group the Freemasons
 in the South.&nbsp;These men are responsible for all of the end-time 
warnings discussed on this page. And all of them have been walking a 
tightrope ever since they learned the truth about what was going to 
happen to the World Trade Center and decided to let the people know. 
Listen carefully to the following clip from <em>The Walk</em> and you will hear what I am saying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your instincts tell you not to trust me. You want someone in 
authority to come out and just tell you plainly that the people 
responsible for 9/11 and COVID-19 are citizens of the United States of 
America. But what you fail to realize is that the penalty for standing 
on that soapbox—<em>when you command a large audience</em>—is death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Albert_Bert_Newton_Stubblebine_III">General Stubblebine</a>
 paid that price. All of us owe a huge debt of gratitude to the men 
behind these end-time warnings. They have made countless sacrifices so 
that someone like me can proclaim the truth. All you need to do is to 
care enough about yourself to learn their language. They speak in 
numbers: sacred numbers, sacred geometry, dates, runtimes, etc. These 
numbers all have meaning and tell a story.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="intro">Guy F. Tozzoli</div>
<p>There can be no doubt whatsoever that the faction of the progeny of 
Jove I dubbed the Ћinkers has known about the World Trade Center for a 
very long time,—since before the construction of the Twin Towers began. 
The evidence for this is overwhelming. However, now I want to speculate 
about who told them. Guy F. Tozzoli’s life is best summarized in this 
New York Times article written at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote style="margin: auto 13%;">
<p class="wp-h1" style="line-height: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">Guy F. Tozzoli, 90, Who Led Team That Built Twin Towers, Is Dead</p>

<p>“You are going to build the trade center,” Guy F. Tozzoli was told on
 his 40th birthday in 1962 by the head of the Port of New York 
Authority. Eleven years later, he had.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Mr. Tozzoli, among the most important 
figures in the development of the original World Trade Center in Lower 
Manhattan, died on Saturday in Myrtle Beach, S.C. He was 90.</p>
<p>His death was announced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/http://www.wtcaonline.com/cms_wtca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=751" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">World Trade Centers Association</a>, an international group that he helped found and then led for more than four decades.</p>
<p>As director of the World Trade Department of the Port Authority, Mr. 
Tozzoli not only superintended development of the twin towers, but was 
also given credit for having brought the architect Minoru Yamasaki to 
the job, after admiring a pavilion by Mr. Yamasaki at the 1962 World’s 
Fair in Seattle; for shepherding the enormously popular Windows on the 
World restaurant atop the north tower into existence with his friend, 
the restaurateur Joseph Baum; and for coming up with the idea — while 
shaving one morning — to use the tremendous volume of rubble from the 
trade center excavation as landfill for Battery Park City.</p>
<p>“Tozzoli led the team of dreamers, planners, architects and builders 
who overcame countless obstacles to construct the tallest buildings on 
earth,” James Glanz and Eric Lipton wrote in&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/magazine/08WTC1.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The New York Times Magazine</a>&nbsp;of
 Sept. 8, 2002. “Sometimes it seemed as if Tozzoli, the director of the 
project for the Port of New York Authority, had personally willed the 
towers into existence — outfoxing enemies, bullying colleagues, 
maneuvering around one intractable problem after another.”</p>

New York Times</figcaption></figure><p>Though it was not Mr. Tozzoli who
 first proposed making the World Trade Center the tallest building in 
the world, he embraced the idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamasaki himself favored a plan to build two 80-story towers, not
 110-story behemoths, Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton wrote in the 2003 book 
“City in the Sky: The Rise and Fall of the World Trade Center.”</p>
<p>“Yama, I have something to tell you,” they quoted Mr. Tozzoli as 
telling the architect. “President Kennedy is going to put a man on the 
moon. You’re going to figure out a way to build me the tallest buildings
 in the world.”</p>
<p>Patrick J. Foye, the current executive director of what is now known 
as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said Mr. Tozzoli was 
“one of the agency’s groundbreaking pioneers.”</p>
<p>Guy Frederick Tozzoli was born on Feb. 12, 1922, in North Bergen, 
N.J., to Silvio Tozzoli, who owned a construction company, and his wife,
 Rose. He received a bachelor’s degree in analytic mechanics and a 
master’s degree in physics from Fordham University. He served as a 
lieutenant in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War.</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli’s first marriage, to Miriam Lane Johnson, ended in 
divorce. Their children — Susan Tozzoli, Kathleen Bernaldo, Richard, 
William, Michael and Tom — survive him, as do his wife, Cynthia; his 
sister, Rita Albert; and two grandchildren.</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli joined the Port Authority in 1946. As the manager of 
marine terminal planning and construction in the 1950s, he supervised 
the construction of cargo-handling centers in Brooklyn, Port Newark and 
Elizabeth, N.J. Mr. Foye credited him with having helped build the first
 container port in New Jersey.</p>

 1960, Austin J. Tobin, who was then executive director of the 
authority, lent Mr. Tozzoli to Robert Moses to help develop the 1964-65 
World’s Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The fair had not even opened 
before Mr. Tozzoli learned of his next horizon while dining with his 
wife at an Italian restaurant on East 14th Street. Mr. Tobin, at a 
nearby table, summoned him over. He wanted to know what Mr. Tozzoli 
thought of the embryonic trade center project, which was then planned as
 a complex on the East River designed by three prominent New York 
architects.</p>
<p>“It looks worse than the bus terminal,” Mr. Tozzoli said, according 
to Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton in the book. “It’s for the birds. I just 
don’t think three architects can do it. It is just impossible.”</p>
<p>On Feb. 12, 1962, Mr. Tobin rewarded Mr. Tozzoli’s candor by telling 
him: “I’m going to create the largest department the Port Authority has 
ever had, the World Trade Department. And I’m going to put you in charge
 of it.”</p>
<p>There were benefits to the job as well as headaches. Mr. Tozzoli 
liked to say that he, his father and his son Michael were the first 
diners at Windows on the World as it was preparing to open to the public
 in 1976. To the disappointment of the chef, however, the elder Tozzoli 
and the young boy both asked for hamburgers and French fries.</p>
<p>As the towers took form in 1970, Mr. Tozzoli was instrumental in establishing the World Trade Centers Association, which&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/business/openers-refresh-button-a-local-dream-of-global-trade.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">promotes international commerce</a>. In his dual role at the authority and the association, he was caught up in a&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/remembering-the-travel-scandal-at-the-port-authority/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">1977 scandal over extravagant travel budgets</a>.
 While not denying that he and his wife had taken many trips to cities 
around the globe at the authority’s expense, Mr. Tozzoli said, “never 
have I put a penny in my pocket.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tozzoli remained at the authority until 1987. After retiring, he 
became the full-time president of the association, with an office on the
 77th floor of the north tower.</p>
<p>That was where he was headed on Sept. 11, 2001, hoping to make a 9 
a.m. meeting. Instead, as he approached the Holland Tunnel entrance 
after leaving his home in New Jersey, he saw smoke pouring from a gash 
in the tower, not far from his own office. “&nbsp;‘It’s going to take us
 a long time to fix that,’ Tozzoli said in his gravelly voice to someone
 in the clot of people around him,” Mr. Glanz and Mr. Lipton wrote in 
the book. No one answered. Then the second plane struck.</p>

<p>So you see it is inconceivable that Guy Tozzoli did not know about 
the plans to destroy the World Trade Center. My reason for thinking he 
is the one who told the Ћinkers or Freemasons of the South is based on 
several things. <em>First and foremost is that only a handful of people 
would have known about the 322 signature on the design of the World 
Trade Center at this early date, and Guy Tozzoli was necessarily one of 
them.</em> Then there is this scene from the movie.</p>

</figure><p>The thinking here is not so much that Guy Tozzoli gave Petit a “forever” pass. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>This
 is the last two minutes of the movie and what I sense is that the 
Ћinkers are honoring the man who told them what was going to happen.</em></span></strong>
 He died on February 2, 2013, so there is no risk of the movie exposing 
him. But my real reason for suspecting that Guy Tozzoli is the man who 
told the Ћinkers all about the plan to destroy the World Trade Center is
 this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I could have gotten this list of the members of the New York World’s 
Fair 1964-1965 Corporation Executive Committee from any number of 
different sources. This just happens to be from a pamphlet entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/masonic-brotherhood-foundation/"><em>Start of Construction Ceremonies</em> Masonic Brotherhood Center August 20, 1963</a>,
 which I keep in my ASL Library. If you look closely, you will see the 
copyright is dated 1961. In other words, Guy Tozzoli is in close contact
 with the men behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/http://tomorrowland/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tomorrowland</em></a>
 immediately before he was hired to build the World Trade Center. If the
 logic of the last sentence escapes you, then what you don’t know is 
that the <em>Tomorrowland</em> movie is all about the 1964-1965 New York World’s Fair.&nbsp;</p>

Here are the last 2:53 minutes of their <em>BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em>

message is dead on. For many years now, the Monolith from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>
 has been widely recognized as depicting a television or movie screen. 
And the producers of this video were very astute in their observations 
that whenever the time machine reaches 88 MPH and disappears into the 
past or future, something involving a film is involved, first a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>film booth</em></strong></span>, then the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Town movie theatre</em></strong></span>, and finally in <em>Back to the Future Part III</em> an <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>outdoor movie theatre</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="intro">Movies, movies, movies</div>
<p>Everything is movies, either the bankers using “predictive 
programming” to mold our reality with the same precision a potter molds 
clay or the Ћinkers using esoteric symbolism to warn us about the real 
significance of September 11, 2001, and the coming Earth crustal 
displacement. In either case, the preferred method of communication is 
to make a movie. Not counting Stanley Kubrick’s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, there are a total of seven movies discussed on this homepage, all of which were <em>beyond any shadow of doubt</em> produced and directed by the Ћinkers. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is not many considering what is at stake.</em></strong></span>
 So to dismiss the possibility that as much thought went into each of 
their scenes as the Bard devoted to his stanzas is naive. And that is 
perhaps one of the most important things you can learn from me. Every 
word, every sentence in any one of these movies may convey as much 
meaning as Shakespeare’s Sonnets.&nbsp;</p>

critical for you to accept that a movie made in 1985 knew the World

<hr><p class="section-notes"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION STATUS</strong></span>: Added summer of 2021. The first draft was completed on September 26, 2021.<br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>SECTION LAST UPDATE</strong></span>: September 26, 2021</p>
<p class="first-paragraph">I list the Gunpowder Plot as the first of the “things the Apophenia Productions missed” because it was <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>a major oversight</em></strong></span>. The linking of <em>Back to the Future</em>
 and the Gunpowder Plot is arguably the main point of the entire movie. 
Why? Because history is repeating itself. Before there was September 11,
 2001, there was November 5, 1605. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What
 is of paramount importance here is that the Gunpowder Plot was a banker
 attack on the nascent Ћinker movement, the very people who are 
responsible for the “fireworks finale” of end-time warnings discussed on
 this An Apocalyptic Synthesis homepage.&nbsp;</em> </strong></span>You 
need to be sure of this because history attributes the Gunpowder Plot to
 the Jesuits. Over time, the Jesuits do become a distinct, third group 
within the progeny of Jove (people who know for sure what is about to 
happen and when), but they began life as the bankers taking control of 
the Catholic Church in Rome, as they would later take control of <em>The United States of America</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>We are talking about the bankers here, not the Jesuits. </em></strong></span>I will return to this subject momentarily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the Ћinkers want us to know who is really responsible for what is going to happen on September 11, 2001,—<em>some 16 years, 2 months, 8 days into the future from the movie release date</em> (as in <em>Back to the Future</em>),—<em>but nowadays anyone can do that</em>. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>The truth is “9/11” was a sloppy operation.</em></strong></span> The controlled demolition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/dust/#Building_7_made_a_mockery_of_us_all">building seven made a mockery of us all</a>. The bankers no longer care what we think because we are too close to the end. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What the opening scene is trying to convey is that before September 11, 2001, there was November 5, 1605.</em></strong></span>&nbsp;
 The movie itself makes this clear by the strong emphasis placed on 1:15
 AM in the opening scene followed by the transition of 1:15 AM to 1:16 
AM (an <em>upside-down <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>and</strong></span> backward</em> 911) at the mall. While still at the mall, a more direct reference is made to “9/11” using 1:19 AM (a <em>backward</em> 911), not once, but twice.</p>

Plot.</div>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;of 1605, in earlier centuries often 
called the&nbsp;Gunpowder Treason Plot&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Jesuit Treason, 
was a failed assassination attempt against&nbsp;King James I&nbsp;by a 
group of provincial&nbsp;English Catholics&nbsp;led by&nbsp;Robert 
Catesby&nbsp;who sought to restore the Catholic monarchy from 
the&nbsp;Church of England&nbsp;after decades of persecution of 
Catholics.</p>
<p>The plan was to blow up the&nbsp;House of Lords&nbsp;during the&nbsp;State Opening of Parliament&nbsp;on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">5 November</span></strong></em></span>
 1605, as the prelude to a popular revolt in the Midlands during which 
James’s nine-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was to be installed as the 
Catholic head of state. Catesby may have embarked on the scheme after 
hopes of securing greater religious tolerance under King James had 
faded, leaving many English Catholics disappointed. His fellow plotters 
were John and Christopher Wright, Robert and Thomas Wintour, Thomas 
Percy, Guy Fawkes, Robert Keyes, Thomas Bates, John Grant, Ambrose 
Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. Fawkes, who had 10 
years of military experience fighting in the Spanish Netherlands in the 
failed suppression of the Dutch Revolt, was given charge of the 
explosives.</p>
<p>The plot was revealed to the authorities in an anonymous letter sent to&nbsp;William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">26 October</span></strong></span> 1605. During a search of the House of Lords in the evening on 4 November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>36&nbsp;barrels of&nbsp;gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble</em></strong></span>—
and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned 
of the plot’s discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several
 made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men 
at&nbsp;Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those 
shot and killed. At their trial on 27 January 1606, eight of the 
survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to 
be&nbsp;hanged, drawn and quartered.</p>
<p class="citation">Wikipedia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Gunpowder Plot</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highlighted the 36 barrels of gunpowder and the fact that this was 
enough explosives to reduce the House of Lords to rubble because that is
 the whole point. The writers want to make a comparison between the 
Gunpowder Plot and 9/11. This is 1605; only seven decades have passed 
since the Jesuits were founded. They are doubtless still loyal to the 
bankers who installed them in Rome. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>In
 other words, this is the Old World bankers attempting to blow up 
another, equally important building almost four centuries ago</em></strong></span>.
 A better analogy could not be found and it serves the dual purpose of 
identifying who is going to destroy the World Trade Center (the bankers)
 and who is behind this trilogy of movies (the Ћinkers, who started with
 Sir Francis Bacon in Elizabethan England).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the meaning of these numbers is brilliant evidence that everything said in the YouTube video <em>BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em> above is correct, the producers of that video missed it entirely. Why? <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Because they do not know anything about the history of the Ћinkers. </em></strong></span>They are in good company though because a quick survey of the Internet shows that in the 36 years since <em>Back to the Future</em>
 was released, no one has been able to figure out what these two dates 
mean. I was able to do so in a matter of minutes, not because I am 
particularly smart, but because I know the importance of what happened 
in Elizabethan England. I pray the reader takes away from this example a
 lesson sufficient to inspire them to read and study my page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/bacon/">№ 53. Sir Francis Bacon and his band of brothers, the Rosicrucian and Freemason secret societies</a>, and to continue this line of inquiry on their own. <em>It does not require you to read or study the Shakespeare plays</em>, only the relevant history of Elizabethan England. Peter Dawkins is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span id="The_OUTATIME_and_AOUT_scenes">The OUTATIME and AOUT scenes</span></h3>
<hr><p>The device that connects these two scenes from different movies 
is nothing less than poetic. There’s a reason for that. I profoundly 
believe that these two scenes taken together represent the very heart 
and soul of Back to the Future and The Walk.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro" style="color: #333333;">The <span style="color: #ff0000;">OUTA</span>TIME scene</div>
<p>This is beyond question the most important 4:32 minutes in the trilogy. It is primarily what connects all three movies. The<em> BACK TO THE FUTURE predicts 9/11</em> YouTube video sees the connection to 9/11 in the Twin Pines and all of the 1:19 clocks, <em>but then misses everything else</em>.
 I named this scene after the OUTATIME license plate which is 
prominently displayed when the DMC DeLorean time machine is unveiled for
 the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This is the core message of the trilogy,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>that we are out of time</em></strong></span>.
 In this section, I will show you the connection of the OUTATIME scene 
to both of the other movies. The scene to which the following clip 
connects to <em>The Walk</em> is the one that invokes the memory of Sir Francis Bacon the most. It does so by quoting from Macbeth.</p>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 20%; font-size: 43px; text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #aaa; line-height: 100%; font-weight: 500;">
<p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br>To the last syllable of recorded time;<br>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br>And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>Signifying nothing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 1px;" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="intro">No one is listening</div>
<p>In that scene, the writers complain that <em>no one is listening</em>. I’ll be honest with you, this scene in <em>The Walk</em> reduced me to tears. The “no one is listening” refrain is one found all over <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 dating as far back as I can remember. I honestly don’t know what drives
 the Freemasons of the South at this point. I can tell you that I have 
written emails to the House of the Temple and most if not all of the 
Royal Arch lodges in the South. In so doing, I gave them my contact 
information because I wanted them to know who I am. What perplexes me is
 their intended audience. If they only want Freemasons to know what is 
about to happen, why make movies? It’s illogical. They have their own 
organization in which they can spread the message by word of mouth. That
 they have invested an untold amount of money and years of meticulous 
planning to erect the Georgia Guidestones and make all of these movies <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>tells me they want to reach a broader audience</em></strong></span>. But as the corresponding scene from <em>The Walk</em>
 makes clear, they have failed. No one is listening. The Georgia 
Guidestones have suffered more graffiti than a New York subway car. What
 is left?</p>
<div class="impact-90">The people must be told in <span style="color: #ff0000;">plain English</span> what is happening.</div>
<p>This is what I am striving to do and the result of my own years of 
failure to reach a broader audience is this new homepage featuring what 
happened on September 11, 2001. This is the end of the road for me. 
These last sections of my new homepage equate to the “no one is 
listening” scene from <em>The Walk</em> in that I cannot do any better. 
I’ve gotten rid of the glitzy poetic stuff. I’ve done my very best to 
take the reader’s attention off of me. All that is left now are the hard
 facts, an honest and accurate interpretation of what the Freemasons of 
the South,—the people I more generally refer to as the <em>Ћinkers</em>,—have been trying to tell us for 42 years now, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>written in plain English</em></strong></span>.
 There is nothing more that I or anyone else can do. So watch this scene
 carefully, and listen to my explanation. People are trying to save your
 life and in the process are risking theirs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>That is the tightrope we walk.</em> </strong></span>The bankers are ruthless in their resolve to succeed. Get in their way <em>and you will die</em>. I make light of it by appealing to their magnanimity, but in exposing the connection of the following scene to the <em>Virus</em> (1980) movie, I am entering into unknown territory. <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 is my destiny, my calling if you will,—something genuinely worth dying 
for,—but I want to see the dawn of a new age. I cannot stop writing any 
more than I can stop breathing, so I must and do accept my fate. My only
 reason for saying anything along these lines is to appeal to the reader
 to listen to what the Freemasons of the South are saying. My 
interpretation of what they are saying is correct. Of that, I can assure
 you.&nbsp;</p>

 on the work of Petter Amundsen, we now know beyond any shadow of a 
doubt that 53 is a number used to identify Sir Francis Bacon as the 
primary author of the First Folio. This is the same man who founded the 
Rosicrucians and by extension the Freemasons. The AOUT scene starts with
 the “Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow” reference to Macbeth 
mentioned above at 52:49. Wikipedia’s summary of Macbeth is apropos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Macbeth</strong></em> (/məkˈbɛθ/; full title <em><strong>The Tragedy of Macbeth</strong></em>)
 is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first 
performed in 1606.[a] It dramatizes the damaging physical and 
psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for 
its own sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course a reference to the bankers. At 52:59, Philippe 
Petit says, “You’re not listening.” That sentence starts and stops in 
the same second. Then at precisely 53:00, he says, “Why is no one 
listening to me when I talk. Are you paying attention?” Here are the 
dots that are being connected:</p>
<ul><li><span class="entry">OUTATIME</span>: As seen in the above video clip, the emphasis that we are out of time from <em>Back to the Future</em>
 is unmistakable. This is reinforced by the AOUT scene emphasis on “les 
carrottes sont cuites” which translates literally as, “the carrots are 
cooked,” but the meaning is more at “the die is cast.”</li>
<li><span class="entry">AOUT</span>: The writers are using the 53:00 
runtime to self-identify as Freemasons of the South who were from the 
very beginning part of the overall plan of Sir Francis Bacon and the 
Rosicrucians even though they were not founded until a century later. 
Following the advice of Paracelsus, the Rosicrucians remained secret for
 100 years after their founding. Only then were the more public 
Freemasons founded. Thus the question “Why is no one listening to me 
when I talk” is much broader than the apparent context. It applies to 
all of the end-time warnings discussed on this homepage and in much 
greater detail throughout <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>. Given my assertion that there exists a numeric signature (discussed above) that indicates <em>Tomorrowland</em> and <em>The Walk</em>
 are our last two end-time warnings, I regard the question “Why is no 
one listening to me when I talk” as a frank admission of failure. On 
that basis, I argue for the need to speak to people in plain English. 
There was a time not long ago when I maintained a “216 Club” page for 
large donors. That was the only page on which I discussed the year of 
the apocalypse. Now I discuss it everywhere and maintain page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://amallulla.com/rebis/">№ 28. A date with destiny: The year of the apocalypse</a>. Furthermore, there are hundreds of things discussed on <em>An Apocalyptic Synthesis</em>
 that you will find nowhere else. Presumably, that is because I tested 
out as one of the most abstract thinkers alive. My point is that the 
people cannot understand this symbolism. That is self-evident to me. So 
either we abandon them, or we speak in plain English. It took me a long 
time to realize the Rosicrucians and Freemasons, and in particular, Sir 
Francis Bacon, are serious Christians. That combined with my heartfelt 
belief that the Nazarene was tortured to death for speaking out on this 
subject, makes abandoning the people, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>not an option</em></strong></span>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="entry">88 MILES PER HOUR AND MM-88</span>: In the scene from <em>Back to the Future</em>, Doc says, “My calculations are correct. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you’re gonna see some serious shit.</em></strong></span>” There is no “if” in the first sentence. <em>The 88 miles per hour and the MM on the Georgia Guidestones cube is the connection to Virus (1980)</em>. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119193621/https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it#:~:text=Viruses%20are%20named%20based%20on,Viruses%20(ICTV)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>
 (WHO), “Viruses are named based on their genetic structure to 
facilitate the development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines. 
Virologists and the wider scientific community do this work, so viruses 
are named by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).”
 I will discuss this further below, but the virus name <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>MM-88</em></strong></span> unmistakenly connects <em>Virus</em> (1980) to the Georgia Guidestones and <em>Back to the Future</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>Putting it all together, COVID-19 is an indication that we are 
out of time. The Freemasons of the South are pleading with people to 
listen to them. The problem is that they are talking in a foreign 
language. That is why so much of An Apocalytoc Synthesis is dedicated to
 explaining how to interpret their use of sacred numbers, dates, 
runtimes, etc. I would prefer you learn the language for yourself, but 
I’m not taking any chances. I always interpret their meaning into plain 
English. Even then, no one is listening. The deck is stacked against the
 people. Without further ado, here is the corresponding AOUT scene from <em>The Walk</em>.</p>

<p>If you doubt what I am saying about the OUTATIME and AOUT scenes connecting the <em>Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Walk</em> movies,—<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>two movies separated by 30 years</em></strong></span>,—then you need to realize that AOUT is deliberately misspelled in the latter. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>In French, the name for the month of August is always spelled using a circumflex over the letter Û.</em></span></strong> In other words, the calendar you see in the above scene from <em>The Walk</em> was specially made for the movie. From the <em>First Folio</em> to <em>The Walk</em>,—for 400 years now,—<em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">deliberate mistakes are always used by the</span> Ћinkers to grab your attention and indicate the presence of a hidden message</strong>.</em> In this case, the deliberate misspelling of AOUT is what I characterize as an <em>anti-cipher</em>
 on this website. It is a way of assuring us that these two movies are 
connected. Of course, the missing circumflex has the same shape of the 
square in the Freemason Square and Compasses.</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph">How did the adoption of the Gregorian calendar rise to the level of importance that it merited inclusion in <em>Back to the Future</em>?
 This is a very insightful question. The need for answering it indicates
 a proper level on interest in the subject at hand. The reason this is 
so important for the Ћinkers is the date June 24, their summer solstice 
before the calendar change.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p class="first-paragraph"><em>I don’t</em>. This is a scene from in <em>Back to the Future Part II</em>.
 There is a very strong emphasis on this date. The dramatic music and 
thunderstorm, and the fact that the scene ends with a simple posing of 
the question, <em>Do you know what happened March 15, 1973?</em>, leaves me with the feeling that we are being challenged to discover the significance of this date.</p>
