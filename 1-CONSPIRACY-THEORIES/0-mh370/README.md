# Current working explanation

The current operating theory is that there may have been important individuals on that plane, potentially relating to Chinese spying, and so the CIA, which possesses the ability to create wormholes with new technology, used 3 orbs to teleport the plane to another location.

There is footage of this, which some claim to be doctored, but it seems unlikely. Ashton Forbes, the primary public investigator on this, believes it was real, and done by humans.
