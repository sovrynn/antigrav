0:14
hey that's fine too we can just chat yeah dude that's cool because that means I can get
0:19
drunker not going um something probably take notes of this because there's a couple topics we need to talk about do
0:26
it just when when disclosure comes around when the moment comes are we
0:31
going live with everyone who can we trust how do we transfer the information
0:36
you know what exactly so my vision of disclosure I like the library thing sending it to libraries on a certain day
My vision of disclosure
0:44
what I had sort of envisioned is I want to publish the paper on archive.com
0:50
because you Absol [ __ ] lutely cannot publish this in a peer reviewed Journal
0:55
because the peer review committee will laugh you at out of there but they'll
1:01
send it to all of their friends sorry what I say we do everything we possibly
1:06
can so we corre we need to reach out we need to have a group of all of the media
1:12
vendors that we can possibly control and ask the multipitch in give them all the
1:17
information all at once and just Spam the internet with it we need Partnerships well ahead of time period
1:25
like you can't be calling these people to be like can I disclose UFO go tomorrow you have to be like in talks
1:32
with these people and so we we need to pick Mark and I have been talking about this already we need to pick uh the most
1:40
credible person we can possibly get who will publish it and talk about it on TV
1:46
I was thinking Tucker Carlson I was thinking Tucker Carlson needs to be Tucker Carlson I'm a big fan of Tucker
1:53
Carlson yes let's call Rush lmba no let's call Tucker no [ __ ] bill lofa you no loofah
2:01
no [ __ ] Bill I'm sorry we'll do it live LOF but that that needs to come out also
2:06
with all the YouTube channels that are relating to this topic everyone needs to be on board and so basically what we
2:14
need is email addresses network phone numbers networking we need to have open conversation with all of these people
2:21
all of these potential channels so that it will be impossible to shut us down so what I want to do like we've been at the
We've been hush hush
2:29
Institute here in Huntsville we've been like intentionally under the like below
2:34
the radar like we've been intentionally like spooky Hush Hush don't tell anyone
2:41
like like we use heed words on our website but we don't actually say it directly what we do um but like so so
2:48
I've kept my profile very low like intentionally and I even went as far as
2:53
I removed the contact form from my website because I was getting so much [ __ ] heat it was just insane I had to
3:00
take the contact form off of my website but like I need like three months
3:05
running up to disclosure to establish myself as a
3:11
personality that people have seen before before disclosure they need to have seen me there needs to be like in the way
3:18
back machine on the internet you can go and find references to me online in the
3:24
three months leading up to disclosure because we need to publish it on archive we need to have Tucker Carlson Tucker
3:31
car Carlson on a Friday night or maybe a Thursday night Thursday night he needs
3:37
to announce we've got something big there's a documentary on Netflix that is posted an hour from now
3:45
and there's a paper on archive.com that's dropping an hour from now
3:52
documentary need to go online at the same time we need to contact Stephen Greer first because he needs to make the
3:58
documentary that's what takes the long here's the thing about the documentary and why it's so crucial I like that um
4:05
let me send you actually um my dad is on Research gate from years ago let me I
4:11
think I can chat in zoom and I can send you a link to his research gate profile
4:17
because we could post it on his profile with him as the author and then
4:22
we could have that Tucker Carlson you know send in that link so let me see if
4:27
I can find him here and also this this research gate profile will give you an idea of like the background that this is
4:34
coming from right um so like disclosure is g to come out of Huntsville Alabama
Huntsville, Alabama. Redstone Arsenal
4:41
out of Redstone Arsenal Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville Alabama is the biggest
4:46
[ __ ] deal that you've never heard of it's the biggest [ __ ] deal that you have never heard of and so we need a
4:54
documentary to drop at the same time that establishes the credibility because
4:59
the fact is that we have deep and wide extensive credibility that no one knows
5:05
about because you're not supposed to know about it because it's in Alabama it's obscure you're not supposed to know
5:11
about it that's the point so we need to establish credibility at the same time that we dropped the paper know what
5:19
Huntsville is Amy know what Huntsville is is that what you're saying Amy not one but two Saturn five
5:28
rockets there one was standing up and one was uh horizontal people don't know what Huntsville is Huntsville is the
5:34
biggest [ __ ] deal on the planet that you have never heard of no it is no like Huntsville is the Silicon Valley of
5:41
government National Security technology and intelligence Community Technology
5:47
and Aerospace technology Huntsville is like the Hub like we are number three on
5:53
the first strike launch list if First Strike happens three targets Huntsville
5:58
will be one of them ala [ __ ] Bama ala [ __ ] B this is Alabama dude in the
6:04
Deep South we're in top three First Strike you're because you haven't heard of us we're in the top three First
6:10
Strike because you haven't heard of us that's why it's on purpose so we need to
6:17
get that out there credibly before we disclose otherwise it's like Alabama
6:23
Podunk redneck [ __ ] they don't know anti-gravity you know what I mean G
6:30
yeah no dude I started the institute for one reason one reason the Institute I
I started the institute for one reason
6:35
started it as a public facing Persona to disclose anti-gravity technology through
6:41
because I told Mark this if you stick your neck out and public at least someone notices if your head gets
6:48
chopped off if you stick your neck out in private [ __ ] you they will bury you
6:53
they will burn down your house while you're sleeping in your bed and it won't even make the news that's why the
6:58
Institute exists so it's a platform of credibility and public facing Persona so
7:04
like sorry M I was falling so I need to establish that like at least three months ahead of time which is basically
7:11
now to be real three months ahead of time is basically today I need a documentary [ __ ] ASAP and the reason
7:18
I need the documentary [ __ ] up it's simple and it's [ __ ] up at the same time we need to tell the story the thing
7:25
is do you believe in the secret space program do you subscribe CRI to the SSP
7:30
being real oh [ __ ] um hold on the let me check my [ __ ] Intel notebook to find
7:37
the correct organization name I don't know hold on I'm talking about the specifically I'm talking about the
7:44
military industrial complex SSP AKA AKA
7:49
locki Boeing northr yes I'm Googling SDI Reagan right now because I want to see
7:55
what year that was I mean I know in general what it was but I want to see the specific year that that was um
8:01
strategic Strategic Defense Initiative organization within the US Department of Defense I'm looking at the wiki here for
8:08
a Strategic Defense Initiative um is this MDA is this MDA
8:13
[ __ ] it's got to be missile defense agency is the Army amard de Miss missile
8:19
defense agency are they in this hold on I'm looking at the wiki the US Army had considered the issue of ballistic
8:25
missile defense as ear as early as late World War II okay so you know that Huntsville is like so we have Thad and
8:33
cram and like Huntsville is the Hub of if a nuclear weapon is coming to the US
8:39
from Russia how are we going to see it most importantly how are we going to shoot it down that is all that is all
8:46
both the research and development and the operational day-to-day Rank and file we're looking
8:54
at the radar [ __ ] is all run from Huntsville they would have to they would have to they have them here they would
9:01
have to have them there and on the west coast wait what city is this again so I'm looking at this Wiki and it's
9:07
talking about leadup to SDI it says Reagan Secretary of State
9:12
suggested that a 1967 lecture by physicist Edward Teller the so-called
9:19
father of the hydrogen bomb was an important pre precursor to SDI I have
9:25
the [ __ ] here man so I have a guy on my team I have a guy on my team that I
9:30
employ and he's like he came to me just he just I didn't go looking for him he
9:35
came to me he came to me and he was basically the best friend of Edward
9:40
Teller um and he was like like this guy like basically helped invent the
9:45
hydrogen bomb but he's not on the Wikipedia article he's a neutron bomb nuclear weapons expert from Huntsville
9:52
Alabama whatever I employ him because he came to me and this guy this guy is so
9:58
[ __ ] good at playing stupid stupid you wouldn't believe it he's like yeah Ed teller was my best friend and he came
10:03
to visit me in Huntsville several times before he died and I invented the neutron bomb and I'm like okay you're an
10:11
S you're you are an SRI plant but when I look at this Wiki about
10:16
SDI I see Bill [ __ ] Dent all over this bill [ __ ] Dent he's on my team I
10:22
employ him he loves me we're buddies he acts like he would follow me off a cliff
10:28
except I think he's a CIA SRI plant on my team cuz he was Ed teller's best friend and I asked him I'm like Bill
10:35
what do you think about UFOs and he's like I don't think about UFOs I don't have any opinions about UFOs and I'm
10:41
like really because your best friend is Edward Teller and Ed teller gave like
10:46
like Ed teller was like big into UFOs I'm like you can't be Ed teller's best friend in reality and not being into
10:53
UFOs I'm sorry what state was it okay hold on I just I'm scanning through this
10:58
wikip media article and my eye just caught suicide packed I have to read what that was let's talk about the uh
11:05
the neutron detecting um device for the radon bombs oh God Bill's bullshitting
11:11
me God damn it he's a spy yeah I mean he still has some use to
11:17
the uh to The Institute he has he's a subject matter expert he's a subject matter expert um I think I could work
11:24
with Bill and really figure out if he's a spy B project I your dad liked my idea
11:33
and Jeremy Jeremy get this so Jeremy get this listen to this so the other night
11:39
um Amy took me to the airport and we were chatting uh right before security
11:45
and they called my name for the plane I got through I got the security all the um agents were on break whatever I ended
11:51
up missing my plane so we ended up staying another night at Amy's house and
11:57
her dad ended up taking me to the airport rep because she had some B some um crazy uh meetings and stuff but the
12:04
night before right when I got there they started talking about this project to make a neutri a neutron Ray and me and
12:11
Amy were talking about the day before she actually read me in on the project basically you're using neutrons to
12:17
detect ordinances under the ground but basically neutrons are you know the
12:22
subatomic particles and they had they release gamma rays um so there's a couple ways of
12:28
doing that and the problem is is that when a neutron generator other than uh
12:33
nuclear stuff but a real Neutron generator creates neutrons in 360 orb so
12:40
like the neutrons you're getting they're going in Old freaking directions like an incandescent light bulb yes pretty an
12:48
incandescent light bulb exactly yeah so her so her dad was saying the only way
12:53
to or toh to get a beam out of it is to have the spins going one way and the spins going the other way
12:59
you know at 180 degrees and you know what I told him dude that's alaan [ __ ] him Dynamic nuclear
13:07
orientation is exactly what I'm doing right now I said listen I I I I showed him the shape in the air I didn't even
13:13
have a whiteboard I said all you gotta do is a circle with two cones in the center that and uh and and make that the
13:19
entire length of the accelerator and then you have two separate electromagnets one uh one South north
13:25
and one north south basically opposite hit it with a with microwave frequencies
13:30
from the side to orient all of the um all the hydrogen atoms and boom you got
13:35
yourself a neutron rate you know what his response was it'd be very [ __ ] heavy practical to the
13:42
end but that I said I I have this company in um in in uh Germany that can
13:48
do 99.95% pure iron it's very expensive but if you do that you can drop the weight
13:55
dramatically probably by like 75% for the iron At Last At at least iron Mass
14:01
yeah the alafon thing is crazy I guess Jeremy's totally on like he's on the
14:06
same page with alaon right um Jeremy's on all different pages he's like he's on
14:12
all different pages okay Jeremy to be honest with you what I think you're talking about with quasi crystals and
14:17
all that stuff is the seventh Force that's like much more advanced stuff than what we're going to be capable of
14:23
doing right now Jeremy are you aware that there are eight forces of nature eight I can name them would you like me
14:29
to name them the four and gravity the fifth is arguably contentiously the higs force
14:37
from the higs BOS on which who the [ __ ] cares I don't and then number six number
14:43
six um is anti-gravity the six force is an gravity that's what that's what my
14:48
group has a mathematical um mathematical equation to physically describe we have
14:55
six force on lockdown and then seventh Force is basically energy into matter into energy
15:04
which sounds like what a portal man if you can energy matter energy matter you
15:09
can like download yourself into a new whatever through a portal dle how do you
15:15
spell that let me Google that what is that oh dir holes h o l e e s okay I got
15:22
it thank you I'm Googling go ahead negative energy I see it on Wiki for Al
15:29
Bear yes but for other [ __ ] no can you describe what squeezed light is so we're on the same page oh D hole theory is
15:36
beta beta Decay stuff okay I'm looking at the wiki beon Wick extended direct
15:42
hole Theory to cover neutrinos inducing the anti nutr and the anti nutrino as a
15:49
whole in a nutrino direct SE [ __ ] what does that mean keep talking I can hear you but I'm standing up to wander around
15:56
I can hear you okay if you let me let me go through this in my head if you have a beam splitter AKA like the single
16:04
split experiment right they're gonna cancel out the [ __ ] Zero Man pause I
16:11
would like to make a prediction about what you're about to say I could be wrong I'm probably wrong are you about
16:17
to tell me that the electron is interdimensional go ahead I'm sorry
16:22
conservation got what kind of momentum the vacuum does it go into the vacuum
16:28
yeah okay you made it coherent are you talking about like absolute zero for
16:34
like I don't know not temperature but maybe Delta G or something like absolute
16:39
zero for energy now I see your face I'm gonna go I have a steak and green beans
Amy goes AFK
16:46
and freaking wedged potatoes in the microwave if I walk to the kitchen and
16:51
get it oh oh geez I forgot about it until just now I put it in the microwave I pressed the button I walked away I
16:57
forgot about it I comtable I'm going to go get my steak I'll be right back continue I'll be right back I can hear
17:04
you well just give me a sec I'll be right back okay Jeremy is that the smartest person you've ever met in your
17:10
life Jeremy you you got to understand your place over here you are the entertainment you're gonna be you're
17:16
gonna be putting together a beautiful piece of content for people to watch that's your job you got to be the
17:22
interviewer you got to make it cool you got to make it exciting all we're after is a piece of media so that means
17:29
shutting up and letting her talk a little bit more or interjecting here and there that's fine you know but you got
17:34
to think of it from the perspective of what are people watching right now what are they hearing you gotta make sure
17:40
your microphone is set she she can talk nonstop like it's insane I got headache
17:47
I don't know I I I really don't understand the seventh Force I'm trying to figure out the sixth Force right now but I think it has to do with cerent
17:53
matter or she's pretty sure that um Ken wheeler ah Ken wheeler Ken [ __ ]
The Honeypot - 5 people who independently discovered gravity
18:00
wheeler I know Ken wheeler has according to Amy Ken wheeler has real anti-gravity and he's a honey pot he
18:08
brings the bugs in and swats them so like don't contact him Ken wheeler is a honey poot Ken Wheeler's a honey poot
18:15
Ken wheeler is a honey pot yes so the NSA according to my secret
18:21
space program time traveling Katana wielding chess playing Japanese like
18:28
genetically engineered [ __ ] sources I don't know if you believe that guy he says that the NSA has a list of five
18:35
people that have independently discovered anti what is
18:40
colloquially but inaccurately called anti-gravity they have a list of five people for the NSA
18:47
and he says he told me some of them and I think I filled in the blanks for the rest of them so Tesla he says this is
18:55
the first Obby no no [ __ ] him [ __ ] Elon I have a consultant that was his
19:02
propulsion head whatever I'll tell you about Elon but no Tesla was the first and then I'm pretty sure the next one
19:09
was podle like pod leov I'm pretty sure I think Eugene has it and then the third
19:16
one was let me think is it in the Ron K list or somewhere else oh you know about R Jesus HBO I'm Che mistake the hanu
Haunebu Saucer
19:25
saucer so I've got the katana wielding time traveling Soldier his name is he's
19:31
Dan Cooper Dan Cooper you can Google him he's on podcasts talking about how he's
19:36
a time traveling sword wielding chess playing whatever he offered to Mentor me
19:41
in chess so that I could settle international disputes with chess I'm not even joking he's crazy so he's one
19:49
of my SSP contacts allegedly the other one I've got this guy in Milwaukee who's German and he
19:56
says his uncle created the hanaho saucer and his last name is Han so it's
20:02
feasible his last name is Han he's at the University of Milwaukee and he's like yeah my great uncle was invented
20:09
the hanaho saucer and I think that's real I think that's real but so I think
20:14
I think Tesla had it Eugene had it Ken wheeler of course has it Ken wheeler has
20:20
it I'm sorry he does um Dan Cooper who's the source of this info says he also has
20:27
it independently discovered Dan Cooper Katana wielding time traveling whatever and the fifth one the
20:34
fifth one supposedly according to this SSP Katana wielding dude is my dad to
20:39
independently discover anti-gravity and this dude this Katana wielding dude made a really big deal about he was like he
Dan Cooper said antigravity has been suppressed 4 other times
20:47
was like okay listen to me it's been independently discovered four other times he said it has been he said it has
20:54
been suppressed every single [ __ ] time and he said I don't think they're going going to suppress it this time he
21:00
said I think you're in the clear he he said they obviously know about you because I've had multiple both
21:06
protective and threatening interactions with various agency affiliations
21:11
whatever he was like if if you haven't had a US government agent come to you
21:16
and say stop shut the [ __ ] up stop shut the [ __ ] up if that hasn't happened
21:23
they're going to let you do it they're going to let you do it this time he said it's been suppressed every other time this time time this time they're waiting
Amy - To publish or not to publish
21:30
for someone to publish they're ready they're waiting they're like there there are SSP [ __ ] that are [ __ ]
21:37
twiddling their thumbs like is Amy not going to publish soon G we've been
21:44
influencing this [ __ ] forever doesn't she know we want her to polish Jesus like there's multiple people doing that
21:50
right now and on the other side of the fence there's multiple parties looking at each other like didn't we tell this
21:56
[ __ ] 3 years ago that we kill people for this is she not listening what is she doing she's still doing it what we
22:04
told her we were going to kill her three years ago so I have these two like I have these two different scenarios
22:10
floating constantly in my life where I have people being like do it do it do it
22:15
you're the one do it and then I have multiple people people being like
22:20
they're gonna kill you don't do it they're gonna kill you I have like multiple of these Whispers in my ears I
22:27
can't even describe it it's crazy and then I even have the people that are like this happens too they're like you
22:34
know they kill people for this right and then they're like because you're a young woman they're gonna rape you before they
22:40
kill you too and I have people like I have people digging through my panty drawer breaking into my apartment
22:46
digging through my panty drawer so that I notice like I have crazy [ __ ] threats going on right now and stressing
22:52
me out it's stressing me out dude I'm stressed Jeremy we saw it we saw it in real life we went down to the um to
23:00
Walmart Super Center and Amy had in her mind to go get this uh the nicotine patch and she actually mentioned it to
23:06
me at the apartment and I know they are Jeremy Jeremy Amy plans on coming down
23:11
for the alifan experiment can you have those cameras on hand to give her physically I don't know if they're
23:17
checking the mail they're definitely um so I was living in in an apartment with
Amy's break-ins
23:22
my ex-boyfriend for six months right I moved back home with my parents because
23:27
of this [ __ ] because people kept breaking into our apartment and they would only do it when we were gone
23:32
together in the same vehicle like he and I would leave in the same vehicle and
23:38
then we would come back together the first time we noticed the brakin we came home and there was a micro USB charger
23:45
plugged into the wall left there cut in half with a knife with the wire with the
23:52
wire Exposed on and like both halves like half of it is plugged into the wall
23:57
and half of it is is just sitting on the counter and it's cut in half with a knife what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] the
24:02
second time the second time we noticed someone had been in the apartment is really [ __ ] weird because the night
24:09
previous it was like in the summer and um he had opened the bedroom window the
24:14
master bedroom window to let the breeze in because he was hot and I said you know what I'm really cold can you please
24:20
we were going to bed I was like I'm really cold can you please close the window CU I feel the breeze that's making me cold and he said yeah I'll
24:27
close it and he pretended close it but he didn't and the next morning I noticed
24:32
the window's still open [ __ ] lied to me he said that he closed the window but he didn't but at that point
24:38
it was hot so I left it open and I left he was gone to work I noticed the window
24:44
is still open I go to work I leave it open I come back like an hour later and the window is closed like
24:51
somebody witnessed that interaction that I asked him to close the window and he didn't he lied to me he said he closed
24:57
it he didn't I noticed it was open the next morning I left without closing it I
25:02
came back before he came back the window was closed cuz somebody was like I'm going to close this window for this girl
25:08
she asked him to close it he lied he didn't I'm going to go close it right now it wasn't him he was at work the
25:15
third time we noticed someone had broken in he plugged in a pair of bluetooth
25:20
headphones to charge into a micro USB right as we left we go to the bar it's
25:26
like a Sunday afternoon we go to the bar and we work for a while together in one car we come back the headphones are
25:33
unplugged they're exactly where we left them he plugged them in at 36% battery
25:39
we left we come back they're unplugged they're at 36% battery which means
25:45
someone unplugged them almost immediately after we left and so I'm
25:51
like that's weird what are they [ __ ] with the headphones for I walk into our bedroom I walk into our bedroom and my
25:58
panty drawer has been dug through and there are pairs thrown on the floor so that I will notice that my panty drawer
26:05
has been dug through and I'm like I'm pissed now they're not panties that you wore right no like they dug through the
26:12
drawer like every girl has impractical panties that she gets for like bridal
26:17
showers birthdays bachelet parties you have your you never wear them they're in
26:23
the bottom of your panty drawer you forget about them they dug through my panty drawer and they pulled out the
26:30
Impractical ones they pulled out the Impractical ones I never wear and they threw them on the floor so I would
26:35
notice and I was like I'm [ __ ] pissed now no dude it's [ __ ] real they have touched my panties it's [ __ ] real no
26:43
they're they're not doing it because they're not doing it for that reason they're doing it to [ __ ] with Amy no do
26:49
it to me too Jeremy did you see those emails I sent uh those emails I received about talking about my no not my dam
Mark's emails
26:56
that's bad no no there going after my daughter yeah yeah I don't know if it's
27:02
a threat if they're they're just trying to [ __ ] with me but they sent me an email with an invite to edit a document
27:10
so I open up the document the document was called the Falcon space I open it up
27:15
it's basically um kids between the ages of eight to 11 and Ashira is eight can can
27:22
go on this adventure of a lifetime millions of years in the future with the US Hawkeye United State United space
27:31
command probably Hawkeye time machine millions of years in the future are they
27:37
rob what the [ __ ] is going on here so I actually contacted them and I was like straight out from the beginning I am
27:44
open source I said you know I don't know if time machines are possible it's kind of you know I believe it I just wanted to explain to them that they probably
27:50
made a mistake here because I am Falcon Space Program not the Falcon Space Program which was the email that they
27:56
used for it basically people were went to extreme lengths to [ __ ] with me
28:01
that happens man I'm sorry who's Dan have you seen one yes what have you seen

29:08
weird ass investor long story weird ass investor poached my dad out of NASA and
29:14
this weird ass investor who lives in Austin Texas he's a real estate investor in Austin Austin Texas made all his
29:22
money doing real estate from for GE in Moscow whatever
29:28
this guy this investor brings Hal to our house three times I I was present for one of the times I happened to be home
29:35
from Seattle at the same time that Hal came over and I sat I sat with him in my
29:41
dining room over there at the dining room table and he was talking about ultraterrestrials and basically
Ultra terrestrials
29:47
ultraterrestrials are like he talks about extra extr terrestrial
29:53
extra implies that they're from somewhere else from theide extra implies
29:58
they're from not here from Ultra ultraterrestrial they're from the do
30:04
they're not necessarily from the outside they're from here oh oh so they're
30:09
they're like um ascended beings or so then they're you high IQ no they're not
30:16
ascended they look like you and me they look like you and me if you don't know I don't know am I one I don't know I was
30:24
born I was born in Huntsville Alabama In The West Wing of huntville Hospital in Madison County Alabama on a
30:31
Saturday around midnight I was born I don't know a Virgo so I was told so I was told which is funny my current
30:39
gynecologist OBGYN the man that does my pop spares every year gave birth to me
30:46
in Huntsville Hospital 32 years ago it's like my current gyno did my delivery 32
30:52
years ago for my mom it's some small town [ __ ] but um no so
Hal talks about ultra terrestrials
30:58
Hal talks about ultraterrestrials and they're from here but Ultra why are they
31:04
so much better why are they why are they so much better here he's not anymore yeah yeah Ultra they're from here but
31:11
why are they so much better do you have a guess Ultra I've never Googled it I don't know I sat at my dining room table
31:18
the man was talking about ultraterrestrials I've never Googled it I don't know ke with a K I don't know
31:24
anything about that I was telling Mark Mark tells me about these conspiracy theories and I'm like dude I have never
I'm the propulsion princess
31:30
been interested in Aliens I was born in Huntsville Alabama to the technical lead of the PRL I'm like the propulsion
31:37
princess of huntville Alabama the propulsion capital of the world totally by accident 100% by accident I was born
31:44
into this ship I have not sought out any information about aliens I have not sought I've sought out zero information
31:51
about aliens everything I know is from direct experience everything I know is
They are us from the future
31:57
about is from direct experience and and people I know being like dude have you heard about the aliens I have this
32:03
evidence Smoking Gun I have never Googled aliens ever I don't know what the current theories are I have no CL
32:09
well so the ultraterrestrials I'll just tell you the ultraterrestrials I think
32:14
have you heard of the p52s and the P 47s do you know what that is they're us from
32:20
the future they're from here they are you they are me they're from here from the
32:27
future p47 is present plus 47,000 years
32:33
p-52 is present plus 52,000 years and basically there's a
32:39
Calamity right so there's like a apocalypse scenario in the near future it wipes out most of like everything man
32:47
and there's the ones that go underground and survive right and then
32:53
there's the ones that somehow stay on the surface and miraculously don't die
I probably know who it is
32:58
I probably know who it is keep going well I mean I mean I can probably tell you who he works for that's not Loy if
33:06
you give me if you give me more detail I've never heard of the man if you give me more detail I can tell you who he
33:11
works for I I Michael at alien con he he seemed like a pretty kind of guy he's
33:17
very shy and timid and I don't think he's really working for anybody he's just an historian like he doesn't really
33:23
care about the current affairs he's an historian of the facts he's like he works for northr he works for
33:32

plasma Thruster discussion okay I was negotia I was negotiating with maxar
34:18
about selling them a plasma Thruster patent on the 17th of December and then
34:23
let's see what else uh Deborah the CEO of the Space and Rocket
34:29
Center had her retirement party the 18th what was the week before let me look not
34:35

37:27
complications that really [ __ ] suck you're going to see listen to me I said
37:32
it first in six weeks to two months to three months on CNN Fox News you're
37:39
going to see that that postc Corona complications are goingon to kill more
37:45
people than the initial infection more people are going to die from the complications after recovery then died
37:53
in the original the original infection I'm here to tell you cuz barely I barely
37:58
[ __ ] made it I barely made it everyone's had it two or three times already but the post complications
38:05
there's going to be a whole wave there's going to be a massive wave like three four five six months after infection I
38:13
had it in September I had it before anyone had it the people that they're studying right now contracted it in
38:20
February or March I've had it since September I know what the postco
38:25
complications are they really suck suck they really suck really bad I I was at
38:31
Defcon in Vegas midt the antibodies don't even help man like I've had it so
38:37
many times I have antibodies at the wazu I keep Rec Contracting it it sucks look
38:42
at that I got a gyroscope on two edges like that basically at a 90 degree angle
38:48
I just had this inspiration right now see what happens when you spin them around uhhuh look at that he's getting
38:55
me off Corona he's like okay off for Corona like so boox right now do matter
39:02
when you think create negative it's killing me what I had beers with a
Beers with a Chinese hacker from Wuhan
39:08
Chinese hacker from Wuhan at Defcon I still have his number in my phone I
39:14
still have his number in my phone I should text him and be like yo what's your name Chinese hacker did you get
39:21
Corona did you give me Corona are you still I should text him and be like are you still alive dude
39:27
are you still alive question mark spin the axis around
39:32
distraction just by just by going on the plane of the spin and shifting it a
39:38
little bit you can for let's not talk about Amy's Health okay it sucks let's move on
Martin Tajmar's job is to publish null results
39:51
yes I'm sorry I ragged all because you said his job is to publish results man
39:58
hold on I spilled my beer hold on just a second you said Martin Tamar and I spilled my beer oh [ __ ] no I know Martin
40:06
he's paid sorry oh D God okay so Martin Tamar has the most advanced the best
40:13
funded the best equipment the best money cash money of any anti-gravity research
40:20
on the planet he's he's he's funded by the German air force all he ever
40:26
publishes is no results that's weird he has the best equipment the best lab he
40:31
has a fleet of [ __ ] grad students Germans Germans no less they're good at
40:37
this he has a fleet of German grad students all he publishes is no results what's up with that I can tell you
40:43
what's up with that I met him in 2018 at 's Park at um like you know Jim Woodward
40:49
Jim Woodward the father of the mock effect whatever mock effect ALU bear Jim Woodward okay so Jim has this like in
40:57
only conference that's in s's Park every two years so it's like whatever actually
41:04
I have my badge from it hold on are you aware of this hold on let me show you my badge I don't know I don't see my badge
41:10
but anyway Tony [ __ ] Tony Roberts and Glenn Anthony whatever he invited me to
41:17
este's park in 2018 and I went with Chantel who's she's Chief research
41:22
officer of geometric energy in Calgary Alberta I don't know if you know who s and Chantel are Canadians whatever
41:28
they're my business partners Shantel and I went to this conference in se's park in 2018 and boy you gotta introduce Sam
41:37
what Sam uh what's his last name again his realart SG his last name isn't really
Reed Hertzog (sp) old footage
41:44
his last name whatever okay show show him show him his last text you oh he was
41:52
contacted by extraterrestrials whatever so I went to this take down a video of
41:57
the uh the arv basically real footage of the arv taken from the arv flying past
42:05
Saturn and it's all in black and white old style footage that you got by
42:11
completing um qu the Quine puzzles the second this is a tangent this is a
42:18
tangent that do are you aware of cicada 3301 you know cicada reddit reddit
42:24
cicada hacker hacker spooky are okay okay so like five years ago there
42:31
was this thing called cicada 3301 or 33 something it was on Reddit it was a
42:37
whole bunch of cryptographic puzzles and you had to like solve the puzzles and the winner like the answer to the puzzle
42:44
sent you to another sent you to another puzzle sent you another puzzle sent you to another puzzle and at the end there
42:51
were coordinates and whoever went to the coordinates got the [ __ ] thumb drive man that was like 5 years ago so like
42:57
I'm in Seattle like four years ago and this 21-year-old hacker dude that says he's
43:04
Cosmo the god from this hacker group it's like Elite Jewish Nazi and no no no
43:10
Elite Jewish autistic H hacking like political activist hacking Group
43:16
whatever he's like their main social engineer he's 21 I meet him in Seattle and he tells me about cicada and he
43:23
actually vets me with cicada he like sends me the puzzles and I don't even try because I'm like dude if you're
43:29
trying to vet me based off of my ability to solve cryptographic puzzles you're vetting me based off of the wrong
43:35
criteria ma'am you should vet me based off of relationships not math so I like
43:40
didn't even try but anyway cicada people think is no I can do [ __ ] like my degree
43:47
I have a double degree in biology and chemistry chemistry is like you know I did quantum chemistry and organic
43:54
chemistry and inorganic and NMR and blah blah blah all the [ __ ] and then I did
44:00
like biotechnology I almost finished a PhD in biotechnology and well it was
44:06
biotechnology bioscience engineering I was doing recombinant protein
44:11
engineering for like gene therapy [ __ ] um just to be clear I think biology is
44:17
probably the hardest he sent me the puzzle he sent me the link to the puzzle and he was like I think you know more
44:24
about computer science than than you let on biologist [ __ ] [ __ ] I think
44:30
you're a hacker and you're not telling me and I'm like dude I'm like dude no
44:35
I'm a biology chemist biotechnologist from Huntsville Alabama and I have a
44:41
history of electrical and mechanical engineering and I worked at Mr de I worked for the US Army I was in the
44:48
weapon Sciences directorate but then I transferred to biotech he was like I think you're a computer science hacker
44:55
and you're just not telling me and so so he sent me these cryptographic puzzles he's 21 he's from Cosmo the god Yugi
45:02
Nazi I don't know you can Google it and I didn't even try to solve the puzzles because I was like dude if you're trying
45:08
to recruit me to some kind of secret [ __ ] based off of me solving some puzzles you don't get my value you don't
45:17
get my value and I'm not I'm not GNA even try because you could you should recruit me yeah so Sam Sam actually got
45:25
to the last stage Okay so there's a new cicada so so Josh the social engineer
45:30
for the autistic Jewish hacking group he tells me about cicada five years ago and
45:36
he's like there's an AI and if I talk about it out of line the AI will know and the AI will punish me blah blah blah
45:43
CIA cicada cryptographic puzzle [ __ ] and then five years later as in two months
45:49
ago there's a cicada 2.0 on Reddit with new puzzles five years Amy Amy you're
Amy figured out she's part Jewish
45:56
you're an autis Jewish girl too that's hilarious isn't it yeah it's like the
46:02
punchline to the joke but um fig out that she's Jewish what we fig
46:08
we figured out that she's Jewish through genetic testing so Judaism follows the mother line the maternal line Amy's
46:16
great grandmother was um given up in an orphanage in Nazi Germany and she has
46:23
that exact percentage of um DNA that is Jewish so we're trying to get her mother
46:29
to do a genetic test if the mother of of Jewish DNA it's then it's
46:37
clear uh 100% clear that they that line of uh mother to mother to Mother they're
46:43
all I was raised believing I was English Scotch Irish anglosaxon mut and then I
46:50
did3 me do 23 and me I did 23 and me I am 18% Ash Kazi Jew
46:58
18% and we have no previous knowledge of Jewish ancestry whatsoever but my great
47:04
grandmother grew up in an orphanage and we have nothing we have no history about
47:10
her whatsoever anyway so Sam solved the puzzle of cicada 2.0 five years later
Sam solved the puzzle
47:17
and he got the coordinates and he went and he got the thumb drive and on this thumb drive was like a whole [ __ ] ton of
47:24
videos of like black and white grainy like through a port hole you know it
47:29
looks like it was taken 60 years ago video through a port hole of like the
47:35
rings of Saturn and like the moons of Jupiter and [ __ ] like that like black
47:41
and white footage and he posted them on YouTube and posted the YouTube links on
47:46
Reddit and so it was this whole big thing about cicada 2.0 and I wanted to show them the mark
47:53
like a week ago cada d we are living on one of the only planets in the universe
48:00
that has internal combustion engines working with GPS systems ah yeah yeah I
48:09
have to send you my business plan I I pontificate about this at length and let
We're the Rocket City
48:14
me tell you I'm in Huntsville Alabama I know I've said that several times we're the Rocket City we are the biggest deal
48:21
you've never heard of Von braa was here and we won the Space Race we developed
48:26
the Saturn 5 here we built the Saturn 5 here we won the Space Race here in
48:32
Alabama whether you've heard of it or not and I can tell you for a fact so
48:37
many prototypes so many prototypes only prototype built like this in the world
48:42
you turn it on the first time it works exactly like you thought it would the first time great data you apply for more
48:49
funding to test it more thoroughly they cancel it they cancel it it goes to NASA
48:56
divestment it goes to the auction block people bid on it and literally scrap
49:02
metal scrap metal scrap metal vendors win the bid and melt it down for scrap
49:09
metal and sell it we could be crazy crazy crazy far we could be on the moons
49:15
of Jupiter we could be exploring Pluto that isn't even a planet anymore if we
49:21
had spent money differently I can tell you the names of so many NASA scientists that are depressed and they want to kill
49:27
themselves because they have built prototype after prototype after prototype in Huntsville Alabama first in
49:34
the world never before seen worked the first time you turned it on exactly like you thought and it was cancelled and
49:40
melted down for scrap metal it's wonder if they have any Neutron beam generators there I don't know Bill is lying to me I
49:47
can't tell Bill's a really good liar I can't tell Amy Amy I'm telling you it's possible I think we could do it without
49:53
bill but his knowledge would probably be useful I know we can do it without bill bill is like on my team just to like
50:00
test me and [ __ ] me up B look at this I literally have the power supply right here that you need for Neutron generator
50:08
right next to me actually Jeremy so Jeremy I was homeschooled I was
Homeschooled through Covenant Christian Academy
50:13
homeschooled through this group called Covenant Christian Academy I was in public school in Huntsville through the
50:19
first grade we moved out to the country I was in podu fun Podunk [ __ ] redneck
50:25
middle of nowhere County School through the sixth grade we got bullied out it
50:30
was awful I homeschooled Jim Ashburn the inventor of
50:35
ybco was a homeschool dad from my cover group Shan bolina MK Ultra [ __ ]
50:43
his parents were both OBGYNs for Mk Ultra and he was raised on LSD from the
50:49
age of six was a CCA homeschool dad Bill Dent the best friend of Edward Teller
50:56
neutron bomb inventor was a CCA homeschool dad and like when we moved into our farm here in the middle of
51:03
nowhere Alabama there was Mr and Mrs Dent next door an elderly couple Grandma
51:10
and Grandpa 25 years later we meet Bill Dent those were his parents his parents
51:16
lived next door to us in the middle of [ __ ] nowhere and he's the inventor of the neutron bomb the best friend of Ed
51:22
Ed teller and he's assigned to my team randomly I didn't look for him he joined my team randomly why did he live next
51:29
door to me 25 years ago that's weird like all of these people homeschooled
51:34
through the same group that I graduated from I can learn a new field in three months name a field I don't care what it
I can learn a new field in three months
51:40
is engineering science physics material science math language biology Arts name
51:47
a field I will be an expert in three months Amy genetics what genetics I
51:54
don't know like all you need to know is how to learn that's right the most
52:00
important skill in the universe fex is the hardest field and you will spend lifetimes learning genetics not three
52:08
months biology is so [ __ ] hard you need a beer beer me go get a beer beer
52:14
you beer me a beer Jeremy's like I'm stressed out I'm stressed sorry so I
I wanna do a Reddit AMA
52:20
want to do a Reddit AMA I want to be like I want to be like I'm a Tim traveling World SA
52:27
prophecy fulfilling [ __ ] ask me anything ask me anything I don't know I've been in denial I've been in denial
52:34
until like I don't know a month ago denial was really rough I'm Googling him I'm Googling him hold on Michael shra
52:41
how do you spell shat how do you spell shat R A TT got it I'm I'm not aware but
52:48
I'm gonna find out Private Pilot military Aerospace historian civilian
52:54
intelligence operation sounds like him Marthur wait you're saying he you're
52:59
saying he had Co in December Michael Strat contact in the desert speaker let
53:05
me click on this 2019 I've been to contct in the desert except I haven't
53:10
been what the bands filled Amendment sorry the man's filled Amendment killed
The Mansfield Amendment
53:15
it go ahead the man's Amendment yeah the mansfiled amendment around that time
53:23
they passed a law saying that um the military
53:28
cannot investigate anti-gravity period Jeremy this was on my uh you this was on
53:34
my YouTube video too yeah I copied it from her but yeah that that that's that's what cut it off Charles babage in
53:41
the Mansfield Amendment um it was it was made it was made illegal for the
53:48
military to investigate anti-gravity that's weird why the thing is Jeremy
53:55
many labs around the country here have all of the equipment they need to prove
54:02
anti-gravity without spending a penny all they have to do is just know cough
Martin Tajmar
54:07
Martin Tamar cough cough Martin Tamar so so I met Martin I met Martin in 2018 at
54:14
the se's park thing and it was so [ __ ] funny because Shantel and I
54:19
Shantel and I like basically like sprung on him mercilessly like we had his
54:27
papers printed out in our [ __ ] backpacks and we were like hey Martin I've been reading your papers since I
54:33
was in high school my Dad tried to get me to replicate Eugene's experiment when I was a [ __ ] junior in high school
54:40
and I've read all your papers for the past 15 years [ __ ] hello I'm
54:45
aware of Eugene and so Chantel and I we approached Martin and we were like Hey
54:50
Eugene pod linov he uses a by layer a by layer by layer
54:57
of ybco and we were like dude Martin we have your Payton we have your paper
55:03
right here in our [ __ ] backpack that we're going to pull out and show to your face and we're like Martin right here
55:10
right here in the protocol it says you used a monol layer not a b layer and you reported no results and we were like yo
55:17
Martin how do you expect to get the same results when you use a monol layer and not a by layer like Eugene did and then
55:24
then I like stood on my [ __ ] box and I was like hey Martin aren't you aware
55:30
that the most interesting phenomenon in the world happened across gradients happen across junctures of Delta
55:36
differences and if you use a monol layer and not a by layer that your results might be different and therefore your
55:43
null results using a ybco monol layer are in fact irrelevant to Eugene's
55:49
results using um ybco what did Martin say he said hey if you have some samples
55:55
send them to ma test them I have some too I'm not sending them to him [ __ ] no basically what you're trying to say is
56:01
that basically he published a no result on purpose no Martin Tam Tamar is funded
56:09
by the German air force to publish null results that conference that Jim Woodward conference invite only
56:16
exclusive [ __ ] it was basically Jim Woodward's grad students prising for the
56:22
mock effect and it was then it was like Martin Tamar's students presenting
56:27
against the mock of that and then it was spook [ __ ] City and that was the whole conference basically SP spook
I met Jan Harzan
56:35
[ __ ] City and like that's where I met Jen Horan and he's like hey here's my
56:40
room number you should come have a slumber party with me kissy face kissy face you know he he actually told me uh
56:47
he was going to that conference after I pestered him about anti-gravity in Jersey when did you see him in Jersey I
56:54
got it on video I sent it to you okay the audio is a little bit low but
57:00
check out that video of me asking him uh about uh anti-gravity it's one one of
57:06
the pictures I sent one of the videos it's like 12 13 minutes long you got turn up the volume too Jan's like my
57:11
buddy he contacts me every three months just to see if I'm still single basically that's my relationship with
57:18
that's my relationship with with my relationship with Jan he's like are you still single kissy face kissy face like
57:25
you're the one you should disclose I believe in you you're the I'm your biggest fan kissy face that's my
57:31
relationship with Jan I don't know I can't make this [ __ ] up anyway is that the recent one or the old one is it the
I'm gonna Gene therapy and biotech
57:38
one where he talks about like he's like the scientist comes in and he smoking a pipe and he's like I won't say the guy's
57:44
name because you're not supposed to smoke a pipe in the lab but he talks about how the pipe smoke like went over
57:50
the experiment and there's like a vortex in the smoke is is that the one you're talking about oh [ __ ] I
57:56
in 2000 let me think in 2004 my Dad
58:01
tried to get me to do the Pod Clint andov experiment for the science fair and I was like
58:08
lolololol I'm going to do gene therapy in biotech now and then I went on to spend a decade in biotech and now I'm
58:14
back on the [ __ ] anti-gravity man they pull me back in no she goes for what's hard Jean I have no idea Jean
58:22
Therapy is a lot harder than anti-gravity anti-gravity is less sophisticated than GPS that's why I keep
58:28
on telling you we're the only planet that got internal combustion engines
58:33
running with GPS systems anti-gravity is a gross misnomer it's really super misleading
Antigravity is a gross misnomer - my life
58:41
the term anti-gravity is really super misleading barking up the wrong [ __ ]
58:46
tree totally wrong misleading this is my life so my dad was the technical lead of
58:52
the advanced propulsion Lab at Nasa Marshall again the propulsion capital of the world so so I was a little autistic
59:00
girl and I was listening to my dad moan and complain about NASA being inefficient and about how we could like
59:07
do anti-gravity if they [ __ ] funded us for my entire life my brain is Wired
59:14
from birth my entire development my brain developed under the conditions of
59:22
listening to the technical lead of the advanced propulsion lab of NASA Marshall the propulsion capital of the world
59:28
complain about how no one was funding him and he had great ideas that is how my brain formed man I know some [ __ ]
Cancelled!
59:33
about this [ __ ] where are the others I know them all it's all cancelled cancelled prototype is the first in the
59:41
world again I said it it worked the first time you turned it on exactly how you expected it to cancel cancel scrap
59:47
metal cancel scrap metal it's like it's the Story of My Life in Huntsville
59:53
cancelled cancelled canceled turns out it wasn't cancelled turns out they took
59:59
it a level deeper so Mark what's this information What specifically true but
1:00:05
not true yes yes no who's he affiliated with I really don't know I don't seek this stuff out I just I know Richard
1:00:12
Dolan Richard Dolan okay who else Rich Dolan's basically historian but he
1:00:19
noty Steven gr is more like a a producer he brings in the emotion he makes a
1:00:25
watchable product that's why I think GRE is is the way to go you have Jeremy
1:00:30
Corbell who created you know LOL you know that [ __ ] with uh with Bob Lazar who really wants to work with Amy
1:00:38
and I don't think that's the right path because to be honest Jeremy corell's you know last thing was complete and utter
1:00:45
[ __ ] it's just like no pause Travis trailer Travis Taylor I have a stick in
Travis Taylor
1:00:51
my mouth I'm sorry Travis Taylor is from Huntsville Alabama he is a NASA Marshall
1:00:56
Redstone Arsenal [ __ ] rocket scientist he's friends with my technical
1:01:01
advisor Tim Pickins Tim Pi is he I don't know guys let's keep the discussion on
1:01:09
producers I'm saying no no hold on just a sec Travis Taylor is a legit legit
1:01:17
rocket scientist he has a great reputation he's a smart man he came off
1:01:22
dumb no pause Travis Taylor in skin Walker Ranch was playing the role of the
1:01:28
every man the straight man what's going on question question that was his role
1:01:35
he was given that role he understood that role and he executed it he's not
1:01:40
dumb he's the legit [ __ ] rocket scientist he's not he was playing a
1:01:46
character Travis trailer whatever I can't say it in Skinwalker Ranch on the
1:01:52
History Channel he was playing the role of the audience the straight man the
1:01:57
audience if if if you've seen Arrested Development Jason baitman is the straight man I don't know if you've seen
1:02:03
it Jason baitman is a straight man he's the one sane person in the whole show
1:02:08
Travis Taylor represents the audience and he ask the questions that the audience would ask and that is his only
1:02:15
reason to be there and he knows it and he does it willingly for a paycheck know he's from here like Rocket City Rednecks
1:02:22
do you know what Rocket Rocket City Rednecks is script paycheck script paycheck straight man
1:02:29
straight man represents the audience script paycheck yeah so so he did a show
Rocket City Rednecks
1:02:35
for I think it was the Travel Channel called Rocket City Rednecks and it was literally about
1:02:41
rocket scientists in Huntsville Alabama because dude the rocket scientists in Huntsville Alabama are in fact the most
1:02:48
advanced rocket scientists in the world they are in fact also huge [ __ ]
1:02:53
rednecks and is hilarious as [ __ ] it's hilarious as [ __ ] and the tra the Travel
1:02:59
Channel made a show about this I think there were two seasons and Travis trailer was like the VIP like main
1:03:06
character of that show but like my I have this other friend Tim Pickins and
Tim Pickens
1:03:11
Tim Tim Pickins was the um he was the head of propulsion for Bigalow
1:03:16
Aerospace Advanced research whatever Bigalow and then before that he was um
1:03:23
the head of propulsion for Virgin Galactic Richard Branson spaceship one
1:03:30
whatever but before that he started at Nasa Marshall on Redstone Arsenal in
1:03:35
Huntsville Alabama and before that his father trained under Von braa and his
1:03:41
father came to the advanced propulsion research lab at Nasa Marshall Huntsville
1:03:46
Alabama where my dad was technical lead and he would [ __ ] test spark gaps and [ __ ] for for Rocket ignition IG and dead
1:03:57
so like I can give you the intergenerational there's paperclip 1.0
It's intergenerational
1:04:04
that's Von braa and his peers there's paperclip 2.0 those are the scientists
1:04:10
trained by Von braon and his peers AKA my dad there's paper paperclip 3.0
1:04:18
that's the Millennials that were trained by the people that were trained by Von brwn and that is me mit is Spook City
1:04:26
they work with SRI oh boy if I see someone if someone approaches me from
If someone approaches me from MIT . . .
1:04:31
MIT I'm like what's your Sr s what is your SRI connection how did how if
1:04:38
someone approaches me from MIT from MIT I'm like [ __ ] how do you know how and why are you talking to me that's in my
1:04:45
is crazy no huntsville's like this weird little time warp of propulsion advancement we don't do anything else
1:04:52
hunsville The Stereotype of hunsville Alabama is like your daddy's a rocket SC
1:04:59
scientist [ __ ] you join the club your daddy's a rocket scientist [ __ ] you join
1:05:04
the club that's houndsville it's like you go to networking events you go to netk no it is it is so if you talk to
Five thousand foreign nation agents in Huntsville, Al
1:05:11
the people in the know like I talked to they will tell you that there is an
1:05:16
estimated 5,000 5,000 foreign nation state agents
1:05:23
in Huntsville Alabama would you not suppose that perhaps there's one
1:05:28
domestic nation state agent per for per foreign agent in Huntsville Alabama
1:05:35
guess what the population is only barely under a it's barely over a 100,000 man
1:05:41
there's barely over a 100,000 people here and there are 5,000 foreign nation state agents
1:05:49
they're bartenders they're oil mechanics they're medical device salesmen they
1:05:55
work at at a restaurant they work at your doctor's office their sole purpose is to go to the bar and sit there and
1:06:02
listen to you talk while you're drunk that's it period there are 5,000 foreign
1:06:08
nation state agents here and all they do is go to the bar and listen to you talk
1:06:14
while you're drunk that's their job that's their job they will rofy you they
1:06:19
will threaten you they will follow you they will get information out of you one way or another The Ether tells you do
1:06:29
that it says the fascinating world of graph Theory the Fascinate the fascinating world of GRA Theory name a
1:06:37
topic I have it what um Arthur Arthur Benjamin Gary Chand pinging I know I
1:06:44
have books um hold on what do you mean by nothing clarify space and Subspace yall chat for
What do you mean by nothing
1:06:52
a minute let me look for a book about nothing on my book y'all chat for a minute let me I got let me see what I
1:07:00
got on a book about nothing hold on no don't put pressure on me chat without me
1:07:05
I'm looking yeah I'm a nerd yeah I really like set theory and group Theory I desperately wish that I had taken more
1:07:12
math in college okay yeah topology I just found it right there okay I found a
1:07:17
book that I think represents nothing okay okay I I'm going to preface this
1:07:22
with um nothing in my my opinion is equal to the equal probability
1:07:30
distribution against all outcomes because if you have all outcomes all possible outcomes are equally
1:07:37
probable that's basically nothing man all possible outcomes are equally probable that's basically nothing this
1:07:44
is my book that I chose this is my book that I chose for that I I came up with something I had to I came up with
1:07:50
something Randomness is the same as nothing is it not it is 0% Z % slash
1:07:57
100% equals infinity equals nothing DNA DNA oh I was muted the whole time I
1:08:03
didn't realize that you were talking yeah basically we are the FI we are the
Mark - We are vectors
1:08:09
finite to God's Infinity SP the way I like to look at it is we're all basically uh vectors we're like an arrow
1:08:17
that's pointing in a certain direction toward a certain reality and what we think about we we bring about so what
1:08:24
you're thinking and what concentrating on is what you want to create and recently I've been concentrating on
1:08:30
bringing about anti-gravity technology that laid me first to uh Jeremy riss um
1:08:37
because you're you're one of the most public people about this and through your videos you know by going public
1:08:44
people actually posted in the in the comments you haven't been reading all your comments because I found everything
1:08:50
that I know about anti-gravity through the comments of your videos Amy was was
1:08:56
a was a link to a video that she gave at Hal five and I got that through a
1:09:01
response to a comment that I made on one of our videos and and also the alaan
1:09:07
experiment was also a comment on one of our videos it'll come yeah so so that's
1:09:13
why we make such a great team you're you're the caller you're making the noise I'm the [ __ ] meter and that's
1:09:20
how we found Amy I I had to take off the contact form on my website it's exciting
1:09:27
it's novel thrilling I feel thrilled but we need to get to the other level here's my experience with that my hell five
Huntsville L5 society
1:09:34
talk is the Huntsville Alabama L5 Society it's like the weirdest like
1:09:41
retired NASA like they have spooky stories that about like weird [ __ ] like
1:09:48
UFOs and time travel and weird [ __ ] like retired NASA whatever Marshall Redstone
1:09:54
Huntsville so I like that's my favorite party to crash like I love to crash a hell five party it's awesome because I
1:10:02
show up it's awesome I show up I'm the only woman there and I'm less than 40
1:10:09
and the dudes lose their [ __ ] they lose their [ __ ] man I'm a woman I'm under 40
1:10:14
and they have heard stories about my dad they're like Richard Eskridge [ __ ] he's
1:10:20
crazy I've heard stories about him like I've literally been networking events
1:10:27
and I'm in line just for an event or whatever and I talk to a random NASA person and he knows the name esgd and
1:10:35
he's like oh Richard esgd he's a crazy [ __ ] he's like he gave me a spectre photometer this one time and I
1:10:42
took it home and I opened the box and a snake crawled out of it that's a real
1:10:47
story I heard that's a real story and like I go to these networking events and
1:10:53
they're like Richard ESD you're Richard ES G's daughter he's [ __ ] crazy and he's [ __ ] smart but um so I crash the
1:11:00
hell five parties all the time and um man my contact form on my website is
1:11:06
like like you said it filters for the quality people oops the problem with that oops the problem with that it's
1:11:13
mostly it's it is the ma the majority of it is nation state mother no one knows
1:11:18
about you except the people who want to know AKA so Galactic Greg is the founder of
1:11:27
the hell five he's been the founder of the hell five for like 25 or 30 years he got he's got this awesome beard he's got
1:11:34
this awesome beard he started this YouTube channel Jeremy what are they gonna hire you to do you're doing what
1:11:40
you're good at what are you good at that's the real question you do it all for free let me comment on that the
Cancel Culture
1:11:47
biggest problem with really smart [ __ ] is they solve one really big problem they get a pat on the back
1:11:55
back and they rest on their Laurels forever I'm really smart I'm a smart
1:12:01
[ __ ] I'm a genius I solved this famous problem I published this paper I
1:12:06
got a Nobel dopamine dopamine dopamine reward complex in my brain dopamine
1:12:12
reward reward reward and they rest on their Laurels you know what they do with their smartest people cancel cancel
1:12:19
cancel dopamine block dopamine block dopamine block they get the ideas from you they get the design
1:12:25
they get the Prototype that works the first time you turn it on and then they cancel it and they take it a level
1:12:31
deeper because the fact is it's a waste of your time if you're a problem solver
1:12:37
if you solve impossible problems it's a waste of your time to optimize a problem you've already solved for application so
1:12:44
what they do you solve The Impossible problem and then they cancel it cancel
1:12:50
it in the white world they move it a level deeper a level deeper they opt ize
1:12:55
it for the secret application and they give you a new problem and then they cancel it and then they give you a new
1:13:02
problem and then they cancel it and a new problem and they cancel it and they psychologically abuse you into seeking
1:13:10
the dopamine of of the satisfaction of reward and they use you as an idea
1:13:16
Factory that's what they do their to their smartest people because if they reward you with success you rest on your
1:13:23
laurels I'm so [ __ ] smart I never have to try again but if they cancel cancel cancel you're constantly trying
1:13:30
to prove yourself you're constantly trying to solve the next problem because the last problem you solved it you
1:13:36
didn't get recognition so the next problem you're going to solve it again even faster even
1:13:42
harder to get recognition they cancel it again they give you another problem they
1:13:48
give you another problem you still you keep trying why are you trying life
1:13:53
liberty and the pursuit of dop mean no they psychologically abuse they psychologically abuse their smartest
1:14:00
people they've done it to us squeeze them they're squeezing them that's what they're doing they squeeze them true
1:14:06
here's a problem solve it cancel here's another problem solve it cancel prove yourself prove yourself prove
1:14:13
yourself what your body's doing to you you always de of me hush they have all
1:14:19
these Geniuses that are constantly trying to be like damn I've worked at n
1:14:25
for 40 years and nothing I've ever done in my entire career has been deployed
1:14:31
cancel cancel cancel I need to try harder on the next one harder on the next one or my career is a failure and
1:14:37
I've wasted my entire career of being a genius guess what all of those ideas got
1:14:43
applied and optimized for the secret space program [ __ ] you never saw
1:14:49
the success you never got the satisfaction you never got the pat on the back you never got the dope of mean
1:14:56
and it means that you work harder harder harder on the next problem to prove yourself so your career isn't a waste
1:15:03
after 30 4 years that's what they do in Huntsville Alabama they psychologically abuse you into solving problems forever
1:15:11
forever idea Factory straight up they abuse you they really do they withhold the satisfaction because it makes you
1:15:17
solve the next problem better if you if you with hold the satisfaction and what
1:15:22
I learned my first job was at at the weapon Sciences directorate for Amor deck I did not apply for that job I
1:15:30
did not apply for that job I I did a science fa project in pzo electrics and
1:15:35
I got a call from the Army and they offered me a job at 15 I couldn't even drive my brother had to drive me into
1:15:42
the Arsenal because they offered the job to both of us me and my older brother who could drive and we we car pulled
1:15:49
every day for the summer yeah dude they're like they're like hey hey I heard you did electric for the science
1:15:56
fair he's a job at the weapons weapon Sciences director building 1408 on
1:16:01
Redstone Arsenal and like I left defense I was born for defense I was raised for
1:16:09
defense I'm like 10 years old and my dad is at the Whiteboard like this is how physics Works little girl and I'm like
1:16:15
my brain is expanding it's too hard but my brain is expanding since I was young I was born for this and I got a job at
1:16:22
the AMR deck weapon Sciences director and then I did that for two years and I was like LOLOL I'm going to go do gene
1:16:30
therapy now in biotech and when I left they were like hey if you ever want to come back to
1:16:36
Amar deck and explode things let us know and we'll pay your tuition for engineering and I was like LOLOL I'm
1:16:43
going to go do biotech now and for the next 10 years I got so many offers for
1:16:48
engineering jobs it was crazy defense jobs they tried to pull me back in so hard it was just insane and I was like
1:16:55
no I'm going to do gene therapy though bro and then I did that for 10 years and
1:17:01
then they sabotaged it they sabotaged it I was 6 months away from a PhD in biotech totally sabotaged it down the
1:17:08
toilet completely ruined over it like it was you know it was through like a fake
1:17:15
vehicle of sabotage right it was like a sexual harassment thing it was like a
1:17:20
really horrible court case like really horrible thing but you know what
1:17:25
if that hadn't happened if I hadn't been if I hadn't have been sexually harassed in gr school I wouldn't be doing
1:17:32
anti-gravity right now that's right I I wouldn't be doing anti-gravity right now
1:17:38
they already did that no is is the anti-gravity Messiah
1:17:43
if I if I had not been horribly harassed in grad school I would be the CEO or the
1:17:50
CTO of a gene therapy company right now and I would not have time
1:17:55
I would not have time to fund my dad's anti-gravity research but but because I was harassed in grad school and I have
1:18:02
PTSD now because it was horrible because of that I'm funding anti-gravity right
1:18:08
now because of that tried to pull me back in so many times it was crazy it's the biggest seal you've never heard of
1:18:15
it doesn't exist except everyone in Huntsville knows it everyone now who's
1:18:21
that let me Google who's that yeah that was my first science fair project my
My first Science Fair project
1:18:27
first science fair project was measuring the specific heat with a bomb calorimeter that I built I'm sorry go
1:18:33
ahead okay he received he received the Edward Teller medal in 1995 I'm looking
1:18:40
at his Wiki right now the i e nuclear and plasma science award INF Fusion
1:18:45
technology in 2003 like I could go in my childhood bedroom right across the hallway over here and I have so many
1:18:52
[ __ ] i e certificates as just crazy from the science sphere oh that's neat
1:18:58
guys guys little uh homework stuff um I just spoke to Brian consoli of altest to
1:19:05
try the alaan experiment okay May 28th would that work for you guys to um
1:19:11
to do the experiment actually also the night of Shu which is uh Pentecost when the Jews got the the Torah from Mount Si
1:19:19
so I think it'll be a perfect night to have uh try the high power here Jersey I'm looking
1:19:26
at my calendar hold on that's the Thursday the 28th what is this I have
1:19:31
something on the 27th let me okay I have a cyber I have a cyber Huntsville
1:19:37
luncheon about Chinese Espionage on the 27th but you know what it's remote it's
1:19:43
remote it's okay I can travel turn off your Bluetooth turn off your Bluetooth
1:19:48
do you have a Mac or a Windows machine here's the thing about open source here's the thing about open source
About open source
1:19:53
they're not necessar looking for your data your data is whatever is compromised already they're on all of
1:19:59
your devices they have your data they have the technology already they know the surveillance is 100% about personal
1:20:08
private personal Intel and intimidation they already know what you know they have your data surveillance is
1:20:16
to collect personal Intel as in your personal your personal Communications
1:20:22
your personal calendar your personal email your personal photos etc etc etc
1:20:27
and the only reason to collect that is to use it against you it's not about the data they have the data it's in you have
1:20:35
no privacy you have to you have to assume if Russia or China or the secret
1:20:42
space program or whatever the [ __ ] nation state if they want it they're going to get it pixer it didn't happen
1:20:49
it doesn't work it's hopeless like like I have crazy ass malware on my [ __ ] that
I have crazy-ass Malware
1:20:56
they like I have multiple bluetooth attacks like physical proximal within
1:21:01
100 fet of me physically Bluetooth attacks that I have logs and live packet
1:21:07
captures for all over town no it's not cool it's disturbing it's disturbing I
1:21:13
have Bluetooth attacks that happened within a 100 feet of me at my co-working space at my office and at local bars and
1:21:22
at the local University yeah your co-working space it was the guy
1:21:27
from Atlanta right that was SRI guy there's like so many people that have gone through that co-working space like
1:21:34
my co-working space is like the internet was set up by this NSA black hat hacker
Mobman
1:21:40
dude that I hate his name is Greg he's a douchebag but like their whole network
1:21:46
was set up this NSA black hat Insider Greg I hate him what you know Greg for
1:21:52
the NSA hack Miami mom man mob m o m o mob man Greg Greg
1:22:03
he's a douchebag it's it might be the same group because they've been harassing like C what's his last name
1:22:10
Greg I hate Greg he's got this weird [ __ ] mustache and he flew a drone and
1:22:16

1:28:00
find this hackers courted by government for cyber security jobs yes this is the
1:28:06
correct article yeah these guys were in my cyber for a while and they did a real bad job because that was the point the
1:28:12
point was to do a real bad job and they troll me all the time I troll them back though I'm so sorry there is like a
A disturbingly big pile of Intel on me
1:28:19
really super disturbing and like I would probably have a panic at attack if I saw
1:28:25
it but there's like a really super disturbingly huge shockingly huge pile
1:28:32
of intel on me personally that these people are using against me like like
1:28:38
they know more about me than maybe I do it's really bad it's really bad they like know my nicknames and they know
1:28:45
like that are significant to me existentially and they know my friends
1:28:51
they're lurking in the accounts of like all my friends because they tweet me from my friends accounts all the time
1:28:58
with malware they're just lurking there and like is bad you should thoroughly
1:29:04
understand the situation before you step into it because I like Dove head first
1:29:10
into the rabbit hole and I will admit I did it on purpose I did I did I totally
1:29:15
did I I dove into the rabbit hole head first 100% on purpose did I understand
1:29:21
what I was doing absolutely not jar Jeremy I think it's been destined that
Mark - Amy should pull the string on anti-gravity
1:29:28
Amy Eskridge be the one who pulls the final string on anti-gravity even if I
1:29:36
in my lab even if I discovered in my lab I think she's the one who needs to do it just because of her Birthright because
1:29:43
of her situation and because that's what a lot of people already believe that's why I went on your show a couple weeks
1:29:50
ago and said I know who it is there is a [ __ ] anti-g Messiah and I know her
1:29:55
name you didn't believe me also you should be what do you think now here's
We discovered anti-gravity and it's the worst thing that could've happened to us
1:30:00
an example so like my girlfriends that I've known since I was like eight years old like they're 32 now like I am right
1:30:09
and so I'm calling them I'm talking to them and I'm like yo we discovered anti-gravity and it's a real hassle like
1:30:17
we discovered anti-gravity and it's like the worst thing that ever happened to us in our entire lives it's like a [ __ ]
1:30:22
curse it's horrible like we discovered anti-gravity and our lives went to [ __ ]
1:30:27
and people started sabotaging us and it's a harassment harassment threat threat it's awful and I'm talking to my
1:30:33
girlfriends that have known me my entire life and they're like hey I've known you
1:30:39
forever I grew up like visiting your house and Slumber partying at your house
1:30:44
and like listening to your dad rant whatever whatever Etc and they're like hey if anti-gravity were to be
1:30:52
discovered it would be in Huntsville and if someone in Huntsville discovered
1:30:57
anti-gravity it would be your [ __ ] family it would be your [ __ ] f it would be the es Bridges and my
1:31:03
girlfriends that grew up with me are like I I believe you I have no doubts they're like whatever I grew up in your
1:31:10
house and yes I believe it I don't even have to see it because I know you they're like yes it makes perfect sense
1:31:16
perfect sense Natural Evolution Natural Evolution fact reality yes they're like
1:31:22
I don't have to see it believe you so like that's where I'm coming from here it's obvious to everyone around me and
1:31:28
my family's in my family's in like total denial my family's in total denial and
1:31:34
um we're like so I hired this new cyber security company and it's run by the C
1:31:40
the former CIO of north or Grumman I was referred to him for a reason and he's
1:31:46
like hey I've been spending 35 years in counter Espionage specifically for the
1:31:52
Navy specifically for Advanced propulsion and I was the Chief Information officer for North Oak
1:31:58
Grumman and I was like okay I'm going to tell you a series of really crazy ass stories and can you please reserve
1:32:06
judgment until the end and I told him a bunch of stories about like electronic and physical surveillance and stalking
1:32:13
and like weird ass death and sexual threats and [ __ ] and I got to the in and
1:32:19
I was like okay I'm ready tell me I'm crazy I'm here I'm ready I'm insane tell me am saying I'm I'm ready for it tell
1:32:25
me and this guy was like I wish I could tell you that you were insane but you're
1:32:30
totally not I'm so he was like I'm so [ __ ] sorry he was like trying to let
1:32:37
me down gently he was trying to let me down gently and he was like the stories you've told me I've heard from other
1:32:44
young women in technology positions and he was like they do it on purpose they do like crazy ass [ __ ] to
1:32:52
you that is unbel believable just so that you feel like you can't tell anyone and they pose as like Agents from own
1:33:00
govern my is that I tell everyone I protect yourself I tell people but I
1:33:07
wait until I have five or six smoking guns before I open my mouth but like this guy was like I'm so [ __ ] sorry
1:33:14
he was like letting me down gently he was like I've heard these stories before from other young women he was like there
1:33:20
was the DVD Blu-ray DVD Blu-ray Epic War where it was like uncertain for
1:33:27
a while whether DVD or Blu-ray was going to predominate and it was between like us and China and he was like there was
1:33:33
this female like technology executive in the US that was affiliated with that and
1:33:38
he was like she couldn't go to the grocery store with her with her children without receiving like people following
1:33:45
her in a car and like threatening her in the parking lot and he was like I've heard all of he's like I've heard half
1:33:52
of your stories and the half of them that I haven't heard I totally believe
1:33:58
he was like they do crazy ass [ __ ] to you just so that you feel like you can't talk about it it's really bad because
I can't do work at bars
1:34:04
like I I love to work at Bars by myself like my most productive zone is to go to
1:34:11
a bar by myself and sit there with my laptop and drink beer with my headphones in and get a [ __ ] ton done I can't do
1:34:18
that anymore Amy Amy I got a freaking bar I got a a bar across the street from
1:34:24
my lab right here I stopped I stopped that habit because I can't go to a bar
1:34:31
by myself in the past 12 months ever without weird ass [ __ ] happening weird
1:34:37
ass [ __ ] hey look that's right across from my uh office I can't go there don't even show it to me I can't go there you
1:34:43
can go there I I know the bartender that's the safest option like I've been roofied multiple times like my extended
1:34:50
team has been roofied multiple times like it's a [ __ ] ruy party over here
1:34:55
it's a ruy party I have tell them about the guy who offered you one or two I can't yeah so I don't go to bars by
1:35:02
myself anymore even though it's my most productive Zone because in the past 12 months if I sit down at a bar by myself
1:35:10
some dude will come like some 50-year-old dude will come and sit next to me and turn to me and say do you want
1:35:16
one ruy in your drink or two I'm like okay and then he'll like drop buzzwords
1:35:21
that are relevant to my life and I'll be like I'm getting the [ __ ] out of here and then sometimes I just end up like
1:35:28
twice now three three times it's like I'm really [ __ ] drunk I shouldn't be
1:35:34
this drunk I didn't drink enough to be this drunk what's happening what's happening why am I so messed up and then
1:35:39
all of a sudden the people at the bar around me are like what do you do for a living tell us do you work for the
1:35:45
government what do you do you're sitting there your laptop it looks cool tell us what you're doing and I'm like hey you
1:35:51
didn't ask me that until I suddenly was disoriented until I came back from the
1:35:57
bathroom finished my beer and was disoriented and super [ __ ] more drunk
1:36:03
than I should have been like it's crazy it is it's like they do that no you just
1:36:08
haven't noticed it maybe you haven't had it happen then because surveillance is 50% about collecting the Intel the other
1:36:17
50% is just straight up about intimidating you and making you be scared jery I just sent you over um
1:36:24
basically a whole conversation I had with these space Falcon Camp Flyers
1:36:29

1:36:37
the future on the USC Hawkeye SSP 20 and back you know about 20 and back oh no
1:36:43

1:37:08

1:37:14
who are hear about it and a lot of people who are going to be in trouble so like I have multiple 20m backers that
20 and Backers
1:37:21

1:37:27
same story it's really weird they all tell the same story they all [ __ ]
1:37:32

1:37:37
service for one specific thing and it's always the same they thank me for
1:37:42

1:37:48
glad that you invented the 3D holographic Med pod and I'm like I haven't done that
1:37:54
Jeremiah that because Jeremiah is working on something very similar um I mean it's much more crude
1:38:00
and we actually had a phone conversation with uh Jeremiah and he showed her one
1:38:06
of the first prototypes I believe of her medp pod I already know how I'm going to build the med pod and I knew how I was
1:38:13
going to build the med pod before they thanked me for my service and then they thanked me for my service and I was like
1:38:19
[ __ ] you [ __ ] you stop [ __ ] with me this is crazy but like why do they tell the same story
1:38:26
and there's like three or four or five of them and they're all like Med pod like why are there five of you saying
1:38:32

1:40:51
telling you they're telling you I love you and [ __ ] like that and they're lying but after six months they're not lying
1:40:57
anymore and they're attached and then they rotate them out and the person they rotate in has existed in your life for
1:41:04
at least six months to 12 months because they line them up like [ __ ] well ahead of time like there's always one
1:41:11

The AntiCabal
1:44:14
talked to a group that claims to be the anti cabal okay the Mana World Holdings
1:44:19
trust is they claim to be the anti cabal but really they're just a freaking
1:44:24
Russian criminal gang and they they they collect Intel basically on scientists
1:44:32
and they like email you and they're like hey we're the anti cabal and we're um we're in a like outside nation state
1:44:40
banking jurisdiction and we have all the gold from the Crusades and we would like to fund you for1 million dollars and
1:44:48
then you talk to them and they just want your white paper they just want your white paper and they're like we're the
1:44:53
anti cabal there's going to be a a dark Financial flip where like the whole
1:44:59
background flips but like the public people are still the same for government
1:45:04
we're the antia ball it's Mana World Holdings trust but like it's really just
1:45:09
a Russian criminal gang that's likeing you out and what happens is like the
Russian Operational Group
1:45:15
Russian gangs that like scope you out for Intel if they decide that you're
1:45:20
worth looking into they refer you to the operational groups and then the operational groups are the ones that
1:45:27
[ __ ] like move into the apartment across the parking lot from you and
1:45:32
stalk you physically in your hometown like when you get referred from the Gathering group to the operational group
1:45:38
it's really bad get get this um Amy tell tell them the story of uh when they swapped out the license plate the
1:45:44
license plate story I found out that I was being physically surveilled by the following method um we
1:45:53
my ex and I realized my ex-boyfriend and I realized that people had been breaking into our apartment while we were gone
1:46:00
together in the same vehicle and so like I'm in the apartment I'm about to go to work and I'm like why don't you take out
1:46:06
the trash and scope out the parking lot and make sure it's okay before I go to work so he goes out there and he's like
1:46:13
there's this weird [ __ ] Lexus it's like a silver Lexus this is a shitty apartment like why is there really F
1:46:21
really nice Lexus in the parking lot and it has tinted windows that are not street legal like just totally dark
1:46:29
totally black tinted windows that are not possibly street legal and so we're he comes back in and we're standing in
1:46:36
our bedroom window looking at the Lexus and talking about it and I say out loud
1:46:42
maybe we should walk over there later and take a picture of the license plate because the Lexus IS across the parking
1:46:48
lot from us but it's backed in so you can't see the license plate Within 2es minutes of me saying hey we should walk
1:46:56
over there later and take a picture of the license plate we were still standing there at the window looking at it
1:47:02
talking about it and a Eastern European looking [ __ ] with a black beanie
1:47:08
dressed all in black in his 50s or 60s walked out of the apartment directly
1:47:14
across from hours holding a license plate and he opened the trunk of the Lexus and he took out some tools and he
1:47:21
changed the license plate right in front of our [ __ ] faces and then he walked back to his apartment and
1:47:27
he put the old license plate on the front patio and went inside left it
1:47:33
outside and it was literally like come get the license plate I have more I have
1:47:38
more where this came from come get the license plate and then after that the Lexus started tailing me and every time
1:47:45
I saw the Lexus it had a different license plate it would be like Alabama plates a different state plate it would
1:47:51
be random dealer plat plates none of which were local just like cardboard temporary dealer plates none of which
1:47:58
were any local dealers every time I saw it it was different plates it would follow me to the gas station to go get
1:48:04
beard I would go get beer at the gas station and that Lexus follows me and even my ex called an Uber once he called
1:48:12
an Uber the Lexus pulled out from the spot across the parking lot from our
1:48:18
apartment drove over to our apartment and said hey I'm your Uber here to pick you up the license matched in the Uber
1:48:26
app but they didn't have an Uber sticker or a lift sticker can't you can't drive
1:48:31
Uber if you don't have a uber sticker he pulled out of he pulled out of his spot across from from our apartment where he
1:48:37
lived and drove over there there to pick him up and said hey I'm your Uber here to pick you up they changed the license
1:48:43
plate right in front of our face like 60 seconds after I said hey we should go take a picture of that license plate and
1:48:50
they leave it on the patio like take it we have more I'm scared I'm tired I'm
The surveillance/harassment is escalating
1:48:56
real tired I need to disclose soon man I need to pull up soon because it's like
1:49:01
escalating it's getting more and more aggressive like over the past this has been going on for like I don't know four
1:49:07
or five years and over the past 12 12 months it's been like escalating escalating like more aggressive more
1:49:14
invasive digging through my pain like digging through my underwear drawer and sexual threats over the past like three
1:49:21
to six months and now I'm like [ __ ] I have to publish [ __ ] I have to publish
1:49:27
because like it's only going to get worse until I publish there's no way out of this there's no way out of this
1:49:34
[ __ ] up situation till I publish
1:49:40
publish basically what needs to happen is I need to come back there and work as your your dad's lab partner um yeah last
1:49:48
thing I told him he he took me to the airport it was like an hour drive uh where're talking about all different
1:49:53
[ __ ] all the way there and the last five minutes we dedicated to anti-gravity I told them listen I keep your secrets
1:50:00
I'll figure it out on my own it's a unique for me but if we want to work
1:50:05
together I need to sign an NDA and you need to sign a DA and then he looked at me he's like what's a DA said a
1:50:12
disclosure agreement I'm really gonna have to work on him to publish cuz he's like like I'm scared because they're
1:50:19
like I'mma rape you but he's like scared even though he hasn't received any
1:50:25
direct threats I think him pretty well I think I think I can work with him in the
1:50:30
lab and work on him pretty well I I had a very very tight connection with him
1:50:35
when we were talking about that [ __ ] with the uh the neutron beam yeah the
1:50:42
idea formed in my head within seconds it was like insane and then your dad's only response is yeah the [ __ ] will weigh a
1:50:48
ton it's gonna be heavy it's gonna be heavy that was his response not said it won't work no that's typical charge of
1:50:56
whatever he's a really smart dude he's heavy to put on a car which may be true
1:51:02
but there is so many applications for that device it's insanee what you can do with something like that we can't even
1:51:07
think of the stuff that you can do with a a neutron beam generator I've come up with so much [ __ ] to do with his
Gravity Chemistry, Yo!
1:51:13
anti-gravity force that he hasn't thought of Cu I'm like gravity chemistry
1:51:18
yo and he's like what's that and I'm like it's a paradigm you just don't know yet gravity chemistry I have a chemistry
1:51:25
degree just watch and wait because he's like very narrowly focused on propulsion
1:51:31
he's like propulsion levitation UFO flying and I'm like hey hey hey chemical
1:51:38
reactions it's big it's a big deal imagine like breaking a Cove valent bond
1:51:43
without high temperature and high pressure cheaply for low energy you don't have to boil something you don't
1:51:50
have to put it at high pressure high pressure and my temperature is dangerous low energy low pressure room temperature
1:51:56
break a coent bond that sounds like John Hutchinson though he was telekinetic though he didn't have any science I'm
Hal!
1:52:03
not so sure about I don't trust Hal put up for [ __ ] Hal says he's telekinetic I heard it from his face yeah yeah and and
1:52:10
Hal you you know who how really Li though Hal is the doctor from stranger things who like will torture a little
1:52:17
alien kid no he get all the juice out of their brain is actually extremely
1:52:23
evil yes no I've met the man he's extremely evil he's very quiet he
1:52:29
listens more than he talks but you can tease things out of him but it's only what he wants you to tease out of him
1:52:35
he's like a nice old grandpa like you talk to him and he's like quiet and sweet and gentle like a nice old grandpa
1:52:42
but he's evil as [ __ ] it's creepy Lou is evil Brandenburg is evil Brandenburg is
1:52:49
like super evil I have I know people worked for Bob Bob Bigalow like Tim
Bob Bigelow
1:52:54
Pickin my one of my technical advisers and I had a intro offer for Bob Bigalow
1:53:01
and I was like I called Tim like I know you worked for Bob should I pitch Bob should I pitch Bob and Tim Tim's like no
1:53:09
no no I was his head of propulsion I did these other projects for him and he was
1:53:14
like Bob will nickel and dime you to [ __ ] death he'll take over your budget he'll want final approval over
1:53:21
everything he'll want majority Equity he'll take over your project and it's not yours anymore it's his and then I
1:53:27
called Jan because I knew that Jan had worked with him I was like Hey Jan should I pitch Bob Bigalow and Jan was
1:53:34
like no he'll nickel and dime you to death he'll take over your project he'll like take control of your budget no
1:53:41
don't pitch Bob so yeah I'm setting up my we can we can go I need to go to bed
1:53:47
and I spilled my guts enough already okay let me pull it up what was is it
1:53:52
did you post the link yeah post it and I'll pull it up and look at it I can tell you Jeremy thank you I'm clicking
1:53:59

1:54:05
interesting
1:54:21
okay oh
1:54:28
I I'm going to read this I'm going to print it and read it I see here it says
1:54:34
um two Photon state it the two Photon coherent state is this like multiple integers of
1:54:41
a photon in a single thing type of thing or is this different
1:54:49
gotcha I'm scrolling through it right now I'm going to print it and read it more thoroughly guys I think it broke up
1:54:55
I can't hear you but I think you were saying we need to sign off yeah so anything that H publish just
1:55:03

Malicious Links
1:55:26
who hasn't worked for the CIA I'm sorry I haven't either but [ __ ] they send me
1:55:32
people all the time like he's not the only one most of those email lists that
1:55:37
you can get on that are like VIP email lists it's a bunch of disinformation and
1:55:42
also if you rightclick and say copy link and if you go to virustotal.com and you
1:55:48
paste the URL in that search bar most of them are malicious IPS the link the vast
1:55:55
majority of them I wouldn't yeah if you look at Ron ke's links they're all mware
1:56:01
like most of them like you can look at virus total for the link IPS and it's like malicious malicious malicious
1:56:07
Trojan Trojan I just use use Ron as a as a reference to find other people like
1:56:15
brandberg or whatever it's email that I wanted I can just look at gmail Space
1:56:20
Ranger something at gmail brandenberg Space Rangers yeah but if you want to find somebody's email that you don't
1:56:26
know you just go to Ron ke's list you can look in the CC list every I like actually I thought that
1:56:33
might be a fake email list for a while I was like I think this is fake I have like I I verified a bunch of the email
1:56:40
addresses because I had I had Hal's personal email address I had brandenburg's personal email address I
1:56:46
had several and so I checked those are the correct yeah I have Jeremy and Bob too we we have like my mom was emailing
My mom was emailing Bob Lazar
1:56:55
back and forth with Bob for like weeks for United nuclear his company like
1:57:01
about a Vandy raft machine that we were buying and they're like they're like negotiating like shipment and stuff and
1:57:07
I'm like you realize you're talking to Bob Lazar right she's like I don't know he just signs his email Bob I'm like
1:57:14
yeah that's Bob Lazar but yeah Jeremy gave me his personal email at alien con
1:57:19
and like email me and so I met him there Jeremy was basically like call me when
1:57:26
you can show me something that I can film and I have something he can film but I want to finish the next one that's
1:57:32
better for him to film and so it's kind of like I'm breaking the rules if I
1:57:38
contact him without saying hey come down here and film because he was like I I'm gonna bring George knp and blah blah
1:57:44
blah and we'll film but Lou said the same thing Lou was like Lou was like oh we're filming the second season of The
1:57:52
ttsa show on the History Channel and we'll come do an episode about Huntsville like I want to bring Tom dong
1:57:58
and Steve Justice and Hal and blah blah blah people to your house and he told me
1:58:04
that the US government would give me a [ __ ] ton of money to keep me from selling it to China and so I called him
1:58:10
and I'm like can you refer me to an active US Army General please to talk about this
1:58:15
transaction and he was like radio silence like I asked him to refer me to active military and that killed killed
1:58:22
the conversation but yeah they [ __ ] with me I'm tired of it I TR them all correct
Mark - Let's get down to business
1:58:28
correct let's let's get down to business okay what do we do from here um are we
1:58:33
contacting Stephen Greer to make a documentary like what's the next step to actually make this happen but but that's
1:58:40
that's an easy that's an easy shortterm problem I think we need to concentrate on the let's say that the date is going
1:58:47
to be sometime in September when we're going to do this we need to get the documentary done document takes the
1:58:53
longest time so we need to concentrate on that first the data is easy the
1:58:58
problem is not getting buried problem is not getting buried you
1:59:04
publish they bury it in Google no one notices that's the problem that's it
