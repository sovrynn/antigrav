There is a script known as the Bongeunsa Malsaji
In this script, I believe there is a description of this large craft flying thru the sky in 794 AD (potentially moving from Mt Taebak), described by State Preceptor Yeonhoe (who witnessed it from the current location of Bongeunsa temple) as a "sky dragon". The Anyang VORTAC site is where I believe this "sky-dragon" landed. It is visible from Bongeunsa temple.

The script proceeds to describe the origin of Bongeunsa Temple. It says: "In the 14th year of King Wonseong’s reign (794), State Preceptor Yeonhoe came to this place and saw a dragon flying in the sky. He realized that this was a sacred land with auspicious energy. He decided to build a temple here and named it Gyeonseongsa (original name of Bongeunsa temple), meaning ‘seeing one’s true nature’. He also erected a stone pagoda with seven stories and enshrined a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha inside it. He invited many eminent monks to teach and practice here, and he spread the Dharma widely."

Dr Greer:"He also had dealt with a facility outside Seoul, South Korea where there was a huge extraterrestrial vehicle that they had downed with apparently some type of electronic warfare system that was in..
..They had to carve out a huge part of the mountain just to contain this object because it was too big to move to any other site and that it is still there." - Dr Greer

Ross Coulthart:"What if some of [it] is so big it can't be moved? ... Big. So big they built a building over it in a country outside the [USA]... Let's see this investigated... Let's test these allegations."

1) So large they put a building over it.
2) Building serves dual purpose.
3) Other purpose is extremely important for national security.
4) Outside USA.

Earliest footage (reddit video from 1973 and Satellite footage from 1978) show this site has existed for some time, at the top of a peak near Gwanaksan and modern Anyang

Similar stonework is *under* the Yeonjuam of the Jogye Order Temple nearby also on Gwanaksan

Manghaeam Hermitage (located on the same peak as Anyang VORTAC) has a large stone Buddha dated to 1479 or earlier, showing more advanced stonework in the area pre-dating the use as a VORTAC

This is where to check for the large ufo that is too big to move.

Relation to Korean Creation histories (I apologize profusely if any of this is offensive, I sincerely respect the Buddhist religion and it's beliefs. I believe the craft from Mt Taebak may have moved to the site at Anyang at some point in our history)

Thank you, I think that is all the information that I have on the site, with the best sources I could find on the open internet. I don't speak Korean unfortunately, there may be more information available in that language.
