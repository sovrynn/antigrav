This stuff is being scrubbed from the Internet.

Most interesting to me is the description that the Roswell UFO's entirely belly was covered in honeycomb structures.

# Roswell UFO: Alleged Craft Descriptions

This document summarizes what **conspiracy theorists, UFO researchers, and eyewitnesses** have claimed about the *structure and qualities* of the Roswell craft.  
(⚠️ Note: These accounts differ from the official U.S. Air Force explanation of a weather balloon / Project Mogul.)

---

## Alleged Structure
- **Disc- or saucer-shaped craft**: ~25–30 feet in diameter.
- **Layered construction**: Interlocking panels, sometimes compared to a *honeycomb* or capacitor-like structure.
- **Seamless design**: No rivets, welds, or bolts; appeared as if “grown” in one piece.
- **Inner framework**: Beams with strange **symbols / hieroglyph-like markings**.

---

## Materials & Properties
- **Memory metal / "indestructible foil"**:
  - Could be crumpled but instantly regained shape.
  - Extremely light yet reportedly stronger than steel.
- **Wood-like beams**: Looked like balsa wood, but unusually strong, often with symbols.
- **Transparent panels**: Some claimed clear, glass-like sections, not ordinary glass.
- **No conventional components**: No wires, electronics, or familiar mechanical parts observed.

---

## Performance & Qualities
- **Silent flight**: Allegedly made no noise.
- **Extreme maneuverability**: Capable of sudden stops, hovering, and right-angle turns.
- **Antigravity propulsion**: Suggested to manipulate gravity/fields instead of using engines.
- **Exotic power source**: Rumored to contain a compact, non-human energy system.

---

## Alleged Occupants
- Reports of **small humanoid beings** (~3–4 ft tall) with large heads and eyes.
- Said to have been found in or near the wreckage.

---

## Summary
According to conspiracy accounts, the Roswell UFO was:
- A **seamless, disc-shaped craft**  
- Built from **exotic layered materials**  
- Containing **memory metal debris** and **unrecognizable components**  
- Powered by **antigravity-like propulsion**  

These claims have fueled decades of speculation and theories about possible **reverse-engineering** of alien technology.
