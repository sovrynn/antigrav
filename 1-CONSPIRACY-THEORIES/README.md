# Conspiracy Theories

In this area of inquiry, the line between conspiracy theories and accepted fact is very blurry.

This folder is specifically for claims that are simply almost completely unsubstantiated, as opposed to knowledge that is relatively better substantiated and somewhat plausible based on significant converging testimonies. The specific line of distinction is set by myself.

The most significant one seems to be MH370, which has a lot of ongoing investigation around it.
