<h2>Hans his life story:</h2>
<p>History of the Hans Coler over unity device. It started in 1920 and 
with two different solid state energy generators. The M machine ( 
Magnetstromgerate) and the S machine or Stromer Erzeuger which would 
produce a much higher load. For the first time demonstrated in Berlin 
1920 and able to power five 1000 candle lights at that time and was 
powered by small Leclanche cells. Based on the description now also 
assumed to be the same invention as claimed by Norrby and as such 
demonstrated too. During the demonstration in Berlin Unruh claimed that 
the excess energy came from splitting atoms and was pilloried for it by 
the scientific community. No one could prove him wrong but still find 
himself in jail. Has to do with the failure of the Science community; 
basically, the physical nature and dimensional of charge is neither 
understood nor established in existing physics. In part, this is due to 
the opaque relationship between mass and charge, with the former being 
attributed to the charge-carrier and the latter often treated as a 
property distinct or separable from the rest energy of the carrier. 
Energy can manifest itself in various dimensionalities as charge in the 
ESU, EMU, CGS and SI systems, and contrast this with the correct 
dimensional of charge, and its expression in the meter-second system. 
German archives show that Unruh and Coler were working together by 1925 
demonstrating there 10-watt machine. And did manage to get it studies by
 three professors with a positive recommendation. W. O Schumann, M. 
Kloss, R.Franke. 1933 Unruh and Coler did build a 70-watt machine and 
1937 a 6 kwatt one. It did power his house for 3 years but lost to a 
direct hit by a bomb during WWII. There were two investors involved and 
did result in some wrangling after the war. The earlier tests and 
demonstrations could not be properly reconstructed later. Again, this 
device was demonstrated in Germany to be examined by Prof. Kloss, the 
now famous Prof. Schumann and by Dr. Frohlich &amp; Coler as independent
 experts.</p>
<p>Not the only ones and a number of other scientists witnessed several 
demonstrations of the device. While Coler’s Magnetstromapparat did not 
give the Kriegsmarine a gravity “free energy” battery for their U-boats,
 the SS Technical Branch E-IV took the design and turned it into a 
Converter for the Haunebu series of disc aircraft which was incorporated
 along with several Van de Graaf band generators and a Marconi Dynamo 
filled with mercury, all of which enabled the craft to reduce mass and 
produce power for the electromagnetic-gravity Thule Tachyon Ator 7 
Triebwerk.</p>
<p>Now there comes another big surprise, according to whistle blowers 
from dulce it is used there and other locations to supply the necessary 
electrical energy. All power at the base is created using an advanced 
system originally created by German scientists following WW2. Probably 
an advanced Han’s Coler’s “Free Energy” Generators. The system uses 
large hexagonal circuits containing magnets and coils to generate energy
 from what is essentially nothing. In the devices mentioned ferrite 
magnets were used and from the insider leakage of information do know 
that the main aliens present in Dulce have been collection natural 
magnets known as lodestone. Nothing known about any special treatment if
 any prior to use in the energy generating device.</p>
<p>The natural variants are less stabile than the artificial produced 
once but that could also be an advantage if the assumed origin of energy
 as mentioned by Unruh would be the source. The energy production does 
find place after the system starts resonating and the major problem. The
 natural magnets being lodestone are much easier to due to natural 
induced oscilalate on earth and necessary to produce. As result of 
oscillation the internal resistance drops.</p>
<p>Reducing the internal resistance to amlmost nill It is clear from 
experimentation that certain results appear that are not explainable 
without the presence of a field. The field consists of an infinite 
number of one-dimensional North and South poles in an incoherent state- 
incoherent due to the presence of a multitude of other interfering 
fields formed by other North and South poles, or particles or quanta. 
Thus, the virtual vacuum is far from empty, far from nothing, it is 
rather seething with potential energy as the primordial powerhouse of 
everything in the universe.</p>
<p>After the war They all reported the device apparently seen working 
and that they could detect no fraud. One model is said to have worked 
for three months locked in a room. One 1946 demonstration, conducted in 
the presence of British authorities, an electrical charge measured at 
450 millivolts was maintained for three hours until a soldered tag 
disconnected, and the meter slowly dropped back to zero. Re-securing the
 broken link failed to restore the tension and charge. The following 
day, 60 millivolts were obtained, but when further adjustments to the 
magnets were made, the tension again fell to zero. During the 
construction and operation of this project, the model was completely 
open, and nothing could be hidden in it.</p>
<p>The device and meter could be picked up and moved around the room, 
tilted, or turned, without effect. Also, it became clear the Hans Coler 
did not have a full/clear understanding of the principles behind it, 
that must have been Unruh but he did passed away. As explained the 
selection of the wire for the bifunctional coils and use of right 
magnets essential. Hans Coleman was offered four hundred pond to build 
on unit in one year being a duplicate of the previous one used to 
provide electricity for his home in Germany. All material he did need 
was provide for by Norwegian and British authorities after the war. The 
deciscion was taken at a later stage to give more time but already to 
late because Hans did pass before that time. <b>Energy from space, the solid-state energy device of Hans Coler.</b>
 Currently the most popular and used all over the world by the so-called
 deep State and also pushing the current climate change agenda, this 
free energy device discovered by Hans Coler in 1925. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-43 alignnone" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-coler-hans-177x300.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="300" srcset="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-coler-hans-177x300.jpg 177w, The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-coler-hans.jpg 364w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px">
 Initially his patent application was rejected because going against the
 at that time known science and classified as “a perpetual motion 
machine”. He contacted three at that time already well known and 
respected researchers in Germany including Dr Schumacher who after the 
war was taken into the US. They studied and tested the device and wrote a
 rapport about it, certified that is was working as claimed, generating 
electricity from somewhere. The source not known, and the world first 
documented solid state energy producer from space born. Hans’s passive 
device which he called the ‘Magnetstromapparat’. The main problem that 
his unit required very careful and slow adjustment to get it operating 
but when it started it continued on test in a locked room for three 
months of continuous operation. At that time nobody, including Hans, 
seems any too sure how this device works but did. ￼ <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-51 alignleft" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnet-windings-of-energy-from-space-invention-300x135.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="135" srcset="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnet-windings-of-energy-from-space-invention-300x135.jpg 300w, The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnet-windings-of-energy-from-space-invention.jpg 639w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">
 It comprises six bar magnets wound as shown here. Some are wound in a 
clockwise direction when looking at the North pole and these are called 
“Right” those wound in an anticlockwise direction are called “Left”: 
These six wired magnets are arranged in a hexagon and wired as shown 
here: It has now long been known that the source of the magnetism within
 a permanent magnet is a spinning electric current within ferromagnetic 
atoms of certain elements, persisting indefinitely in accord with 
well-defined quantum rules. This atomic current encircles every atom, 
thereby causing each atom to emit a magnetic field, as a miniature 
electromagnet. This atomic current does not exist in magnets alone. It 
also exists in ordinary metallic iron, and in any element or metallic 
alloy which can be “magnetized”, that is, any material which exhibits 
ferromagnetism. Again: All ferromagnetic atoms and “magnetic metals” 
contain such quantum atomic electromagnets. In specific ferromagnetic 
materials, the orientation axis of each atomic electromagnet is 
flexible. The orientation of magnetic flux both internal and external to
 the material, pivots easily. Supreme and easy in resonance are these 
natural occurring magnets found in our soil called lodestar by the 
Aliens/the Deep State/Globalist. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>How exposure to radiations alters the dynamics an any electric circuit.</h2>
<h4>A conductor expos-ed to these radiations has its resistance reduced 
and its conductivity increased while dielectrics become partial 
conductors and their conductivity is not described by Ohm’s Law.</h4>
<p>I will briefly interrupt to point to another aspect and difficulty to
 trigger some of these free energy devices. Prior and during WW2 coper 
wire was isolated using a barium coating and barium was used because of 
it property to lower wire resistance. What most do not realize the 
barium contains not only many isotopes but also traces of Radium. It is 
considered safe, but this might be an accelerator part of the devices. 
When you take a look at conventional nuclear batteries and see how they 
convert alpha and beta decay into electricity it becomes clear. How 
exposure to these radiations alters the dynamics an any electric 
circuit.&nbsp;A conductor exposed to these radiations has its resistance
 reduced and its conductivity increased while dielectrics become partial
 conductors and their conductivity is not described by Ohm’s Law. These 
characteristics have been known by the scientific 121 community since 
1903. In addition to that, in 1916 it was shown that by using a weak 
solution of radium in conjunction with radio aerials near the antenna or
 tuning coil greatly increased the receptivity of the radio, even in 
circumstances were no stations could be received before. Most of these 
phenomena are explained by looking to the atomic scale to see what 
happens as a particle is absorbed. For an alpha particle being absorbed 
in copper, the panicle’s traveling at a high rate of speed and has a 
large amount of kinetic energy which is transferred too the electrons of
 the copper by collision. The alpha produces some 86,000 ions before 
being absorbed. These ions are then free electrons in the conductor in 
addition to those normally present. This process is called the 
Multiplication Factor of the cell. That is because for every incident 
beta particle you get say 20,000 electrons. Conventional nuclear 
batteries are composed of cells of several types. For now, we will 
concern ourselves with only the basic four. The commonly known beta cell
 as first demonstrated by Mosely in 1913, was a beta source sitting on a
 feed through insulator at the center of an evacuated conductive sphere.
 As a beta particle leaves the source, it gives the source a net 
positive charge and as this beta particle is absorbed by the sphere it 
contributes a negative charge to this electrode. Further charges 
increase the difference in potential and current may be drawn from this 
to a load in the usual manner. An alpha source may be substituted by the
 principle remains the same. This is the beta or alpha voltaic effect 
and batteries of this type have been built as large as 2,000 watts that 
could fit into the palm of your hand. The contact potential difference 
cell or a class 2 nuclear battery: Simply put, this is a conventional 
battery composed of a stack of plates composed of materials with 
different work functions only no electrolyte is used. Instead, we 
im-merse the plates in a radioactive gas. The life of all nuclear 
batteries are proportional to the half-life of the source material used.
 For radium, the half-life is 1,600 years. The advantage of this type of
 cell over the beta cell, is its multiplication factor. One high energy 
beta particle ionizes many gas molecules before it is finally stopped. 
Each of these new charged particles is effective in placing a charge on 
the electrodes. Cells of this class commonly have multiplication factors
 of about 200.</p>
<p>The third type is the class 3 P-N junction cell. By simply exposing a
 p-n junction transistor to alpha or beta bombardment, the transistor 
produces power to drive a load. Cells of this type have multiplication 
factors in the realm of 200,000 times. The Moray Device and the Hubbard 
Coil were Nuclear Batteries according to Paul Brown, Collected Research 
Mongraphs, Vol. 1 Cadake Industries, 1987.</p>
<p>The natural radioactive decay elements emit three primary forms of 
radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha particles are helium nuclei or 
helium ions consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons giving them a mass 
number of 4 and each alpha particle carries two positive charges.</p>
<p>Beta particles on the other hand are high speed electrons meaning 
that each beta carries a single negative charge. Gamma rays are photons 
and consequently there is no need to discuss them here. An alpha or a 
beta particle in motion constitutes a current element. Several charged 
particles in motion are an electric current and is measured in amps.</p>
<p>What he trying to tell you is that alpha and beta radiation is a 
naturally and electrical phenomenon but these radiations have no 
polarity. Natural radioactivity is emitted in all directions so that you
 end up with no net current or voltage. The object of a nuclear battery 
is to provided polarity to these emissions to achieve an electric 
current.</p>
<p>As the particles are absorbed, the velocity goes to zero and the 
magnetic field collapses, yielding a variation of flux to produce an emf
 in an induction coils. Now, the amount of power contained in these 
particles is phenomenal. A charged particle in motion carries with it a 
magnetic field of a magnitude determined by the particles charge and 
velocity. Energy is stored in this magnetic field and is released as the
 particle is slowed or absorbed.</p>
<p>The opposite principle of accelerating a particle by pumping energy 
into it. For instance, an alpha particle traveling at 67% the speed of 
light is absorbed in 6 mils of copper; the energy produced during this 
absorption is equivalent to 10 watts. Granted, this is 10 watts for only
 a microsecond, but if you are using a 1 curie alpha source then you are
 now talking about 37 billion alpha particles per second. Madame Curie 
is quoted as saying “The complete transformation of a gram of radium 
into lead, produces about 100,000 times more energy than the combustion 
of one gram of hydrogen.”</p>
<p>And Ernst Rutherford said, “one pound of radium would radiate energy 
at the rate of 10,000 horsepower.” Hopefully, it is now obvious to you 
that the energy content of radium is enormous. He then start to explain 
the working of The Moray Device and the Hubbard Coil. He points out that
 the use of radium is common to both of the devices in our discussion.</p>

 have harnessed the cosmic rays and caused them to operate a motive 
device. Cosmic ray investigation is a subject that is very close to me. I
 was the first to discover these rays and I naturally feel toward them 
as I would toward my own flesh and blood. I have advanced a theory of 
the cosmic rays and at every step of my investigations I have found it 
completely justified. The attractive features of the cosmic rays is 
their constancy. They shower down on us throughout the whole 24 hours, 
and if a plant is developed to use their power it will not require 
devices for storing energy as would be necessary with devices using 
wind, tide or sunlight. All of my investigations seem to point to the 
conclusion that they are small particles, each carrying so small a 
charge that we are justified in calling them neutrons. They move with 
great velocity, exceeding that of light. More than 25 years ago I began 
my efforts to harness the cosmic rays and I can now state that I have 
succeeded in operating a motive device by means of them. I will tell you
 in the most general way, the cosmic ray ionizes the air, setting free 
many charges ions and electrons. These charges are captured in a 
condenser which is made to discharge through the circuit of the motor. I
 have hopes of building my motor on a large scale, but circumstances 
have not been favorable to carrying out my plan.</em>

device used a unique rectifier (RE-valve) to efficiently capture the 
static electricity from the surrounding air. Moray’s oscillator tubes 
(magnetron transducers) utilized this high-voltage energy to generate an
 internal secondary “cold” fusion reaction. Stick an antenna up in the 
air, the higher the better, and wire it to one side of a capacitor, the 
other going to a good earth ground, and the potential difference will 
then charge the capacitor. Connect across the capacitor some sort of

 The patent refers to “the sun, as well as other sources of radiant 
energy, like cosmic rays,” that the device works at night is explained 
in terms of the night-time availability of cosmic rays. Tesla also 
refers to the ground as “a vast reservoir of negative electricity.” 
Tesla was fascinated by radiant energy and its free energy 
possibilities. He called the Crooke’s radiometer, a device which has 
vanes that spin in a vacuum when exposed to radiant energy “a beautiful 
invention.” He believed that it would become possible to harness energy 
directly by “connecting to the very wheel-work of nature.” On his 76th 
birthday at his yearly ritual press conference, Tesla announced a “<strong>cosmic-ray motor</strong>”
 when asked if it was more powerful than the Crooke’s radiometer, he 
answered, “thousands of times more powerful.” In 1901 Nikola Tesla was 
one the first to identify “radiant energy.”&nbsp;<strong>Tesla says that the source of this energy is our Sun</strong>.
 He concluded that the Sun emits small particles, each carrying so small
 of a charge, that they move with great velocity, exceeding that of 
light. Tesla further states that these particles are the neutron 
particles. Tesla believed that these neutron particles were responsible 
for all radioactive reactions. Radiant matter is in tune with these 
neutron particles. Radiant matter is simply a re-transmitter of energy 
from one state to another.
<h3>HOW HIS RADIANT ENERGY RECEIVER WORKED</h3>
From the electric Potential that exists between the elevated plate 
(plus) and the ground (minus), energy builds up in the capacitor, and, 
after “a suitable time interval,” the accumulated energy will “manifest 
itself in a powerful discharge” that can do work. The capacitor, says 
Tesla, should be “of considerable electrostatic capacity,” and its 
dielectric made of “the best quality mica, for it has to withstand 
potentials that could rupture a weaker dielectric.” <a href="https://www.nuenergy.org/uploads/radiantenergy2.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-257" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/radiantenergy2.gif" alt="harvesting free energy with device" width="201" height="130"></a>Tesla
 gives various options for the switching device. One is a rotary switch 
that resembles a Tesla circuit controller, another is an electrostatic 
device consisting of two very light, membranous conductors suspended in a
 vacuum. These sense the energy build-up in the capacitor, one charging 
positive, the other negative, and, at a certain charge level, are 
attracted, touch, and thus fire the capacitor. Tesla also mentions 
another switching device consisting of a minute air gap or weak 
dielectric film that breaks down suddenly when a certain potential is 
reached. Tesla received two patents for this radiant energy device; U.S.
 Patent No. 685,957 –&nbsp;<strong>Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy</strong>&nbsp;and U.S. Patent No. 685,958 –&nbsp;<strong>Method of Utilizing Radiant Energy</strong>.
 Both these patents were filed on March 21, 1901 and granted on November
 5, 1901. In these patents he explains: “The sun, as well as other 
sources of radiant energy throw off minute particles of matter 
positively electrified, which, impinging upon the upper plate, 
communicate continuously an electrical charge to the same. The opposite 
terminal of the condenser being connected to ground, which may be 
considered as a vast reservoir of negative electricity, a feeble current
 flows continuously into the condenser and inasmuch as the particles are
 …charged to a very high potential, this charging of the condenser may 
continue, as I have actually observed, almost indefinitely, even to the 
point of rupturing the dielectric.”
<h3>THE EARTH’S ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE</h3>
<img decoding="async" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/tesla46_02_small.jpg">
 &nbsp; Tesla’s intent was to condense the energy trapped between the 
earth and its upper atmosphere and to transform it into an electric 
current. He pictured the sun as an immense ball of electricity, 
positively charged with a potential of some 200 billion volts. The 
earth, on the other hand, is charged with negative electricity. The 
tremendous electrical force between these two bodies constituted, at 
least in part, what he called cosmic energy. It varied from night to day
 and from season to season but it is always present. The positive 
particles are stopped at the ionosphere and between it and the negative 
charges in the ground, a distance of 60 miles, there is a large 
difference of voltage – something on the order of 360,000 volts. With 
the gases of the atmosphere acting as an insulator between these two 
opposite stores of electrical charges, the region between the ground and
 the edge of space traps a great deal of energy. Despite the large size 
of the planet, it is electrically like a capacitor which keeps positive 
and negative charges apart by using the air as a non-conducting material
 as an insulator. The earth has a charge of 96,500 coulombs. With a 
potential of 360,000 volts, the earth constitutes a capacitor of .25 
farads (farads = coulombs/volts). If the formula for calculating the 
energy stored in a capacitor (E =1/2CV2) is applied to the earth, it 
turns out that the ambient medium contains 1.6 x 1011 joules or 4.5 
megawatt-hours of electrical energy. In order to utilize this 
high-voltage energy you must do two things — make an energy sink and 
then devise a way of making the “sink” oscillate.
<h3>“ZERO POINT ENERGY?”</h3>
Such a “sink” has to be at a lower energy state than the surrounding 
medium and, for the energy to continually flow into it, the energy must 
be continually pumped out of it. Additionally, this “sink” must maintain
 a lower energy state while meeting the power requirements of the load 
attached to it. Electrical energy, watt-seconds, is a product of volts x
 amps x seconds. Because the period of oscillation does not change, 
either voltage or current has to be the variable in this system’s energy
 equation. Bifilar wound coils are used in the system because a bifilar 
wound coil maximizes the voltage difference between its turns, the 
current is then minimized. A coil in our system, then, will be set into 
oscillation at its resonant frequency by an external power source. 
During the “zero-point” portion of its cycle the coil will appear as one
 plate of a capacitor. As the voltage across the coil increases, the 
amount of charge it can siphon will increase. The energy that is taken 
into the coil through the small energy window (zero-point), call it what
 you will, appears to be the key to the success of this system. It is at
 this zero-point where energy is condensed into positive and negative 
components of current. When energy escapes from the “sink” the magnetic 
field collapses and a strong magnetic quake is created in it’s wake. A 
properly tuned system can capture and convert radiant energy in such a 
prescribed arrangement.
<h3>ENERGY DIRECTLY FROM THE ATOM</h3>
The radiant energy system is a&nbsp;<strong>self-oscillating capacitive system</strong>.
 Once it is set into oscillation, very little power is expended in 
keeping it going. Because it is an electrostatic oscillating system, 
only a small amount of charge moves through the system per cycle, that 
is, the coulomb per seconds = amps are low. If the charge is used at a 
low rate, the energy stored in the system will be turned into heat at a 
slow rate enabling the oscillations to continue for a long period of 
time. Tesla’s “<strong>COIL FOR&nbsp;</strong><b>ELECTROMAGNETS</b>,” 
patent #512,340 is a very special coil design because, unlike an 
ordinary coil made by turning wire on a tube form, this one uses two 
wires laid next to each other on a form but with the end of the first 
one connected to the beginning of the second one. In this patent Tesla 
explains that the double coil will store many times the energy of a 
conventional coil.<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;Measurements of two coils of the 
same size and with the same number of turns, one with a single, the 
other with a bifilar winding, show differences in voltage gain. These 
bifilar Tesla’s coils can be explained solely on the basis of their 
electrical activity. A bifilar coil is capable of holding more charge 
than a single wound coil. When operated at resonance, the distributed 
capacitance of the bifilar coil is able to overcome the counter – 
electromotive force (e.m.f.) normal to coils, inductive reactance. 
Because of the electrical activity, a bifilar coil does not work against
 itself in the form of a counter – EMF, the potential across the coil 
quickly builds to a high value. The difference between the turns becomes
 great enough that the energy is practically all potential, at this 
point, the system becomes an electrostatic oscillator. Minimal work is 
done in my radiant energy system due to the absence of wasted 
displacement currents. As small heat losses occur, oscillations are 
maintained by surplus charge generated by atomic catalytic reactions, 
energy is siphoned from the kinetic moments of these charges. Very low 
energy expenditure allows power delivery to an electrical load over an 
extended time period without an external fuel supply. After an initial 
input of energy from an outside source, the radiant energy electrical 
generator will operate as a very efficient device. By reviewing history,
 it is understandable why some inventions are not commercialized. It is 
economics, not science, that is the main factor. It will be remembered 
that alternating current was opposed by powerful financiers in Tesla’s 
time. Michael Pupin, noted in his autobiography: “…captains of 
industry…who were afraid that they would have to scrap some of their 
direct current apparatus and the plants for manufacturing it, if the 
alternating current system received any support. A most un-American 
attitude…but ignorance and false notions prevailed in the early 
nineties, because the captains of electrical industries paid small 
attention to highly trained scientists.”<sup>[2]</sup>
<h3>PHILADELPHIA PUBLIC LEDGER NOVEMBER 2, 1933 TESLA ‘HARNESSES’ FREE COSMIC ENERGY</h3>
Inventor announces discovery to displace fuel in driving machinery. 
Calls Sun main source. A principle by which power for driving machinery 
of the world may be developed from the cosmic energy which operates the 
universe, has been discovered by Nikola Tesla, noted physicist and 
inventor of scientific devices, he announced today. This principle, 
which taps a source of power described as “everywhere present in 
unlimited quantities” and which may be transmitted by wire or wireless 
from central plants to any part of the globe, will eliminate the need of
 coal, oil, gas or any other of the common fuels, he said. Dr. Tesla in a
 statement today at his hotel indicated the time was not far distant 
when the principle would be ready for practical commercial development. 
Asked whether the sudden introduction of his principle would upset the 
present economic system, Dr. Tesla replied, “It is badly upset already.”
 He added that now as never before was the time ripe for the development
 of new resources. While in its present form, the theory calls for the 
development of energy in central plants requiring vast machinery. Dr. 
Tesla said he might be able to work out a plan for its use by 
individuals. The central source of cosmic energy for the earth is the 
Sun, Dr. Tesla said, but “night will not interrupt the flow of new power
 supply.” <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1937" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/Tesla_circa_1890.jpeg.jpeg" alt="Nikola Tesla Portrait circa 1890" width="220" height="295">Clearly
 Tesla is not talking about an atomic reactor. He is directly converting
 ionized particles generated by radiant matter. It is not nuclear energy
 as we know it today. Tesla Radiant Energy is directly converted to 
electrical power! Tesla believed that the Sun generates highly charged 
particles and that radiant matter is a re-transmitter of energy, it is 
this transfer of energy that could be used for practical purposes.

magnetic flexibility and key in developing/use of similar energy

 There were very advanced civilizations living on planet earth right now

 What is going on: By simply passing a wire over the north or south pole
 of any magnet, an electric current is generated within that wire and 
the basis of our current electricity generation. ￼<img decoding="async" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/D-inside_tunnels.jpg">
 Now, whether we like it or not, there is new information that forces us
 to throw this entire model of “flux cutting” and relative motion 
between conductor and magnet out the window, or at least subject it to 
dramatic changes. For MIT’s own Dr. Bruce DePalma has reminded us that 
electric current can be generated with the conductor and the magnet 
moving at exactly the same speed – thus eliminating any possibility that
 the flux lines could be “cut.” For if the magnet is moving, the flux 
lines should automatically be moving along with it in conventional 
theory. This bizarre and interesting means of generating electric 
current was actually discovered by famous pioneer physicist Michael 
Faraday on Dec. 26, 1831, but until DePalma came along, no one ever paid
 any attention to it. <strong>So again, we are doing the impossible – 
rotating a one-piece magnetized conducting disc and drawing energy out 
of it. Now this is where the real problem for scientists comes up: time 
after time, DePalma was able to show that these “homopolar” or one-piece
 rotating generators were actually superior in performance to the 
typical two-piece stator and rotor design that we discussed above. In 
fact, these generators were more than superior; they appeared to be 
impossible, as they created more electrical energy output than it took 
to spin them.</strong> It is from this simple and yet incredible 
principle that DePalma created his own “free energy” device, known as 
the N-Machine. Important: Two additional discoveries will help to prove 
the point even more – namely that the energy in the magnet is not being 
generated by the magnet itself, but from an outside force that is 
flowing through the magnet. THE ASPDEN EFFECT The first discovery that 
we will mention to prove that outside aetheric force is flowing through a
 magnet is that known as the “Aspden effect,” from Cambridge 
University’s Dr. Harold Aspden. It was presented in the Institute for 
New Energy’s New Energy News, vol. 2, no. 10, Feb. 1995. Yes, it’s 
really true! You may want to read that sentence again, as its importance
 can be missed if you are just skimming through – almost anyone can see 
that this totally violates all known laws of physics. To be more exact, 
the amount of heat energy that it takes to get the magnetic rotor 
spinning is measured in joules, and normally in this experiment it would
 take 1000 joules to get the rotor to spin. However, if you stop its 
motion and then start it again within less than 60 seconds, it will only
 take 100 joules to achieve the same effect! In other words, it is ten 
times easier to spin the magnet once it has already been spinning. The 
energy within the magnet itself will continue “spinning” inside even 
when the magnet is not moving. ￼<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-52" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnetstromapparate-300x266.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="266" srcset="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnetstromapparate-300x266.jpg 300w, The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-magnetstromapparate.jpg 461w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">
 If we compared a magnet to a glass, then it becomes easier to see. A 
glass, of course, is a container that can hold a given amount of liquid 
inside of it. If we see the magnet as a container for a non-physical 
aetheric “fluid,” it becomes very simple. If you were to stir up a glass
 of water and then remove the stirring rod, it will naturally take less 
energy to stir up the water in the glass again if you wait less than a 
minute before trying. This is similar to the idea of a “siphon.” If you 
suck water through a hose and place the bottom of the hose at a lower 
level than where the water is that you are siphoning from, then the 
water will continue to empty out of the hose until the entire supply 
runs out. This is explained by the fact that there is much greater 
atmospheric pressure, in pounds per square inch, pressing on the surface
 of the water, as opposed to the much smaller amount of pressure that is
 on the water that emerges from the end of the hose. In the case of 
Donald Roth’s experiment, if magnetism is a “flow” in the aether, it 
appears that once you “get it going” through a local area of space, it 
can continue at the same force with the magnet itself being much farther
 away from the point of action. It is as if a temporary aetheric current
 is set up in the space-time fabric itself – certainly not a “typical” 
property of magnetism by anyone’s definition. Getting the flowing 
started the main and explain why these devices work.( getting them 
started). When moving it will continue almost indefinite. And right 
away, when we start looking at these new concepts of magnetism, we 
should be thinking in our minds of various ways in which these 
yet-unknown properties could be harnessed for technological purposes and
 not stop or blocked. Even though the glass itself wouldn’t have moved, 
the water would still be spinning inside as it remained still. So from 
this experiment, we can see that it certainly appears that the energy in
 a magnet itself is in a form of direct fluid motion, which is quite 
different from how we are normally accustomed to visualizing it. This 
should leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that we have not yet uncovered 
the true mysteries of the electromagnetic field. Just as the blood 
flows. In a piece of magnetized material, the majority of the molecules 
are oriented in the same north-south direction. Providing that you have 
the right type of metal, you will achieve a magnetic force when this 
north-south molecular alignment is in place.<img decoding="async" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/magnetic-poles-flipping.jpg">
 There is also the existence of positive an negative energy and making 
it more complex but will not discuss it here. These assumptions have 
allowed us to study the atomic level and interpret our data, but they 
are by no means proven facts, as we shall see. In this conventional 
thought process, each metal has a certain number of electrons in its 
outer shells, and some of these electrons will only “want” to spin in 
one direction. In other metals such as iron, the outside electrons can 
spin in many different directions, and the flowing presence of a 
magnetic field can organize them so that they all spin together. At this
 point, each atom becomes a miniature magnet in its own right. Now think
 about this in terms of Aether flow. If each atom of each molecule is 
formed by a whirlpool in the Aether, then there has to be a direction 
for the whirlpool to be spinning. Most of the compounds on Earth are 
non-magnetic, non-conducting “dielectric” materials, meaning that they 
do not conduct electricity easily and their molecules are not all 
aligned in the same direction. In this case, as they are continually 
created by the Aether, the fluid-like energy will stream into them from 
all different directions equally; or to put it in more technical terms, 
the streaming Aether flow is isotropic, meaning “the same in all 
directions.” In the case of a magnetic material, it appears that the 
Aether flow is anisotropic, meaning that it is not the same in all 
directions; instead, the flow has a specific orientation. And 
thus:&nbsp;The rotating magnetic force of a magnet is nothing more than 
the aether flow itself as it creates the magnet moment by moment. Since 
the molecules of the magnet are all aligned in a certain direction and 
are good “conductors,” Aether will only flow through it in a certain 
direction, like water flowing through a pipe. The north-south 
orientation of the “electron orbits” in the molecules of the magnet 
cause it to draw almost all of the Aether that forms it in from the 
north pole and back out through the south pole, creating a loop. The 
magnet is not created like any other object in our physical reality – 
instead, there is a definite direction to the energy that streams 
through it. And it is this directional flow of aetheric energy that 
creates what we term as magnetism. <img decoding="async" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/Hans-Coler-frre-energy-device.jpg" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Hans-Coler-frre-energy-device.jpg">
 Back to our German naval captain Hans Coler who also invented an 
over-unity generator. He called this device The Stromerzeuger. <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-60" src="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-stromerzeuger-300x261.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="261" srcset="The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-stromerzeuger-300x261.jpg 300w, The%20Hans%20Coler%20device,%20free%20energy%20from%20space.%20%E2%80%93%20My%20Blog_files/123-stromerzeuger.jpg 604w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">
 The basic Stromerzeuger element is that of an open secondary circuit, 
capacity loaded, inductively coupled to a primary circuit. The apparatus
 principally consists of two parallel connected spools which being 
bi-filarly wound in a special way, are magnetically linked together. One
 of these spools is composed of copper sheets (the spool is called the 
‘plate spool’). The other one is made of a number of thin parallel 
connected isolated wires (called ‘spool winding’), running parallel to 
the plates, at small intervals. Both spools can be fed by separate 
batteries (6 Volt, 6.5 A Hr were used). At least two batteries are 
needed to get the apparatus operating, but subsequently, one battery can
 be removed. The spools are arranged in two halves each by the bi-filar 
windings. The plate spool also contains iron rods with silver wire 
connections. These rods are magnetized by a special battery through 
exciter windings. Electrically, the exciter winding is completely 
isolated from the other windings. Hans said that the production of 
energy takes place principally in these iron rods and the winding of the
 spools plays an essential part in the process. It should be mentioned 
that the spool circuit is powered up first. Initially, it took a current
 of 104 mA. The plates and exciter circuits are then switched on 
simultaneously. When this is done, the current in the spool circuit 
dropped from 104 mA to about 27 mA. It is suggested that an electron be 
not only regarded as a negatively charged particle but also as a South 
magnetic pole. The novel feature is that the capacities are connected to
 the secondary core through permanent magnets. It is claimed that on 
switching on the primary circuit, “separation of charges” takes place 
with M1 becoming positively charged and M2 becoming negatively charged 
and that these charges are “magnetically polarized” when they formed, 
owing to the presence of the magnets. When the primary circuit is 
switched off, a “reversing current” flows in the secondary but the 
magnets “do not exert a polarizing effect on this reversal”. Two of the 
basic elements shown above are placed together making a double stage 
arrangement with the copper plates close together (presumably as 
capacitor plates): The secondary windings are both exactly equal and 
wound in a direction such that, on switching the primary coil on, the 
electrons in the secondary coil flow from P1 to P2 and from F1 to F2. 
This is the basic working arrangement. More of these double stages can 
be added to provide higher outputs. <strong>Selection and producing magnets.</strong>
 The best soft magnets can be found in the earth itself and known as 
lode stone, lode star. However, a permanent magnet has two separate 
energy streams coming from it. The main field is the magnetic field 
which is very well known. It normally flows out in every direction, but 
in the MEG, a very good conducting path is provided by the frame of the 
device. This traps the magnetic energy flow and channels it around 
inside the frame. This prevents it masking the second energy field which
 is the Electrical energy field. With the magnetic field moved out of 
the way, it is now possible to tap this energy field for additional 
power output. The MEG looks like a very simple device, but in actual 
fact, it is not. The magnetic flux from a permanent magnet consists of 
two components. One component is rotary, and it spreads out in every 
direction. The second component is linear, and it gets swamped and 
hidden by the rotary field. If a toroidal yoke wound with an input 
winding over its whole length is used, then that trap all of the 
rotating magnetic field inside the toroid. The snag is that this 
requires considerable input power to energize the toroidal winding. This
 is a major boost to the functioning of the device. Now, with the 
rotational magnetic field trapped inside the toroid, the liner field 
becomes accessible, and it is a very useful field indeed. It is 
electrical in nature. In actual fact, magnetism and electricity are not 
two separate things, but instead, they are different aspects of the same
 thing, so both should really be referred to as “electromagnetism”. 
Anyway, the linear field is easy to access once the rotational field has
 been removed. All that is necessary is to pulse it sharply. When that 
is done, real electricity is introduced into the MEG from the 
surrounding environment. The sharper the waveform, the greater the 
additional electrical input becomes. This is what makes the MEG have a 
COP of say, 5.4 which is a practical working output. If the output is 
then manipulated to provide the input power needed for the pulsing, the 
COP effectively becomes infinite as you do not have to provide any power
 to make it work and you have a substantial power output. The power 
output divided by the power input you have to provide to make the device
 operate, gives the COP rating, so any output divided by zero input, 
always gives infinity. The magnets may be formed of any polarized 
magnetic material. In order of descending effectiveness, the most 
desirable permanent magnet materials are Neodymium-Iron-Boron (“NIB”), 
Samarium Cobalt, AlNiCo alloy, or “ceramic” Strontium-Barium or 
Lead-Ferrite. A primary factor determining permanent magnet material 
composition is the magnetic flux strength of the particular material 
type. In an embodiment of the invention, these magnets may also be 
substituted with one or more electromagnets producing the required 
magnetic flux. The Phi-Transformer. Toroidal shapes are clearly 
important in many devices which pull in additional energy from the 
environment, even to the extent that Bob Boyce warns against the 
high-frequency sequential pulsing of coils wound on a toroid yoke, 
producing a rotating magnetic field as unpredictable surge events can 
generate some 10,000 amps of additional current which will burn out the 
circuit components and can very well trigger a radiant energy build up 
which can create a lightning strike. <strong>Magnetic core.</strong> 
This core is a critical component of the generator. The core determines 
the output power capacity, the optimum magnet type, the electrical 
impedance and the operating frequency range. <strong>The core may be any
 shape, composed of any ferromagnetic material, formed by any process 
(sintering, casting, adhesive bonding, tape-winding, etc.). A wide range
 of shapes, materials and processes is known in the </strong><strong>art of making magnetic cores. Effective common materials include amorphous metal alloys (such as sold </strong><strong>under the “Metglas” trademark by Metglas Inc., Conway, S.C.), nanocrystalline alloys, manganese and zinc</strong> <strong>ferrites as well as ferrites of any suitable element including any combination of magnetically “hard” and </strong><strong>“soft” ferrites, powdered metals and ferromagnetic alloys, laminations of cobalt and/or iron and silicon-iron </strong><strong>“electrical steel”.</strong>
 This invention successfully utilizes any ferromagnetic material, while 
functioning as claimed. In an embodiment of the invention, and for the 
purpose of illustration, a circular “toroid” core is illustrated. In an 
embodiment of the invention, the composition may be bonded iron powder, 
commonly available from many manufacturers. For those readers who are 
unfamiliar with physics, it may be surprising to realize that magnetism 
and electricity, which certainly seem to be used as two separate forces 
in our technology, are always traveling together in this fixed 90-degree
 relationship where magnetism is dynamic, and electricity is static. We 
know that you cannot have electricity without magnetism and vice versa, 
and that the two fields will always exist in this very precise geometric
 arrangement. <strong>Definitions:</strong> The scientific term that was
 chosen to describe something that does not move is static, so the 
electric field was called an electrostatic field. This diagram allows us
 to clearly see the observed interplay between the two forces. As we 
look at the picture, we can see that the two fields are in a constant 
90-degree relationship to each other. This is called an “orthogonal” 
relationship, and it will become very important when we start looking at
 the theories surrounding the idea of higher “dimensions” of space. 
Since the electromagnetic wave forms the basis of our Universe, all 
theorists who study the concepts of higher dimensions believe that each 
higher dimension must somehow be located at another 90-degree turn away 
from the three main axes of length, width and height that we now see! If
 this sounds confusing or impossible to you, then you’re on the right 
track! No matter where you turn a corner and rotate 90 degrees, you’re 
still going to end up in what we would call “three-space.” This puzzling
 conclusion of the existence of “higher dimensions” has come from the 
“crystal ball” of mathematics. Certain equations demonstrate that there 
must somehow be a way for energy to have “more room” to travel through 
than what we see in our own “three-space.” However, this doesn’t make it
 any easier to visualize. Mathematics can often be used to propose 
solutions to problems without giving us a solid visual model to work 
with. When we start looking at Rod Johnson’s model, we will see that 
there is a very good reason for the shape of this waveform; it 
ultimately reveals a hidden geometry inside of itself, and this geometry
 was independently discovered by James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century
 and again by Buckminster Fuller, who announced it to the world at his 
Planet Planning address in 1969. Johnson was unfamiliar with these 
earlier discoveries when he independently determined that the same 
geometric form was being described by the electromagnetic wave. DYNAMIC 
FORCE, STATIC ENERGY Let us not forget how important this wave really 
is; it is the primary means through which the energy of the universe is 
expressed. Another important and puzzling aspect of the behaviour of 
this waveform is that the two components do not at all move in the same 
fashion. Michael Faraday was the first to determine that magnetic fields
 were continually rotating – and in scientific terms this means that 
magnetism is a dynamic field. However, he also discovered that:&nbsp;The
 electric fields do not move at all; they require the dynamic movement 
of the magnetic wave to propel themselves forward. The scientific term 
that was chosen to describe something that does not move is static, so 
the electric field was called an electrostatic field. This can be 
visualized in a very simple way. If you think about an object that 
floats on the surface of the ocean, it is only the movement of the wind 
and water that would cause it to move forward – and the behavior of the 
electric field is very similar. If you only looked at the electric part 
of this waveform by itself, there would be no directional movement 
within it. If you ask an engineer why the magnetic field is dynamic and 
the electric field is static, you will probably get “That’s just the way
 it is” as your answer. And yet, this is of very obvious importance, as 
the electromagnetic waveform is the primary means by which energy 
travels in our universe. Know that we are dealing with something much 
more interesting than what we have been led to believe. This is an 
active, living energy force in its own right; the primary means by which
 this Universal Being is continually forming itself. That point cannot 
be underestimated. Einstein and many others firmly believed that when 
the Unified Field was discovered, it would prove that all the Universe 
was composed of electromagnetic fields, not “particles.” The next 
important terms that we need to cover are “force” and “energy.” We have 
already stated that magnetism was given the term “dynamic” because it is
 consistently moving, and electricity was given the term “static” 
because it is motionless. Since magnetism was observed to rotate and 
move in set directions, there needed to be a name for that behaviour – 
and it was called a force. The word “dynamic” is a descriptive word, 
whereas “force” is an active word, like when discussing the force that 
you would need to push a heavy object. Therefore, magnetism is a dynamic
 force, meaning that it is a field that is in motion. Now in the case of
 the electric field, Faraday discovered that it was essentially 
motionless, as we pointed out in our example of a piece of flotsam 
floating on the surface of the ocean. However, that doesn’t mean that 
the field has no energy. What we do have is a field that radiates energy
 away from itself. So, if we use our analogy of an object floating on 
the surface of the ocean again, we could see that as it travelled, it 
will radiate heat energy from the Sun. If you put your hand near the 
object, you could feel the radiant, static energy from it, but it would 
still need the dynamic force of the wind and water to move it along. 
This is how electricity is able to power our machines. So, whereas force
 was an active word that meant that the field moved in a given 
direction, the word “energy” was chosen as the word to represent 
something that radiates while remaining motionless. Therefore, Faraday 
named the electric field “electrostatic energy.” The current will always
 flow from negative to positive, causing the opposite poles to attract 
each other, and the atoms in the metal will simply adopt this same 
polarity when they are subjected to the magnetic field. If we determine 
that the Aspden effect and other findings of magnetism are truly showing
 us that the Aether behaves like a fluid, then we also know that the 
fluid can and must be able to vibrate, by definition. Therefore, we can 
expect that we should see all of the trademarks of vibration – light, 
sound and geometry –throughout our Universe, from the quantum to 
Galactic level. When we consider all of these points together, magnetism
 becomes a “whole new ball game,” as one might like to say. The 
implications are quite profound, as it proves that it is indeed very 
possible for us to harness a limitless supply of this fundamentally 
conscious “free energy” and never have to worry about scarcity or 
pollution again. The only thing that stands in the way at this point are
 the “powers that be” who are all too ready to squash anyone who tries 
to build, patent and mass-produce devices of this type. Looking in 
hindsight what is always easy, and the explanations as provided here are
 harmful acts on behave of governments and commercial actors. It 
contradicts their actions and behavior as being in to protect and 
advance humanity but self-centered interest.&nbsp; Nothing of what is 
happening is by accident, nothing looks like it seems and everything as 
such is connected. The earth belongs to their inhabitants not a small 
group in power nor the elite. Worse, at the same time the secrete users 
of the free energy of space being the Deep State/cabal and the Davos 
group lineated with push for alternative green energy/under their 
control. That fossil fuel now still under their control will start to 
fade. Because science is knowledge, and knowledge is power, those who 
desire power tend to have research divisions heavily involved in secret 
science – the more they know, the farther up the causality chain they 
can act, and thus the more effects they can control and do.</p>
