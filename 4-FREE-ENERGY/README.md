# Free Energy

There are many "reports" of people discovering free energy.

Some prototype toy experiment videos are out there, but of course, I've never tested any of them.

This is ultimately the last part of this effort. Why? To power an electrogravitic craft that can fly indefinitely.

# Purpose

While this has many, many applications, perhaps the most immediately obvious one is that if you could develop it, you could create an antigravity craft that could fly forever (until the parts break down).

# ECE (one flavor of UFT)

So, according to ECE UFT, this is clearly possible. The task is to construct some contraption that can "capture" energy from the field. Accordingly, inventors may have stumbled across it in some way, understanding intuitively how it works even if they cannot provide a theoretical explanation or generalize the scheme.
